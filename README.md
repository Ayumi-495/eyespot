# Systematic review and meta-analysis of anti-predator mechanism of eyespots: conspicuous pattern vs eye mimicry (version 1.0)

This repository contains the all code and data of **_Systematic review and meta-analysis of eyespot anti-predator mechanisms: conspicuous patterns vs. eye mimicry_**. Our meta-analytical study examined why butterfly eyespots intimidate birds and tested two hypotheses: the eye mimicry hypothesis and the conspicuousness hypothesis. Despite conflicting empirical studies, our meta-analysis supported the idea of the conspicuousness hypothesis. We also found a key factorâ€”larger eyespots were more effective in predator avoidance. Our findings suggest that birds avoid eyespots mainly due to their conspicuousness and emphasise the importance of such pattern characteristics in predator avoidance.
