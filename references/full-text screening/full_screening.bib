  abstract={When constraints on antipredator coloration shift over the course of development, it can be advantageous for animals to adopt different color strategies for each life stage. Many caterpillars in the genus Papilio exhibit unique ontogenetic color sequences: for example, early instars that masquerade as bird feces, with later instars possessing eyespots. I hypothesize that larvae abandon feces masquerade in favor of eyespots due to ontogenetic changes in signaler size. This ontogenetic pattern also occurs within broader seasonal shifts in background color and predator activity. I conducted predation experiments with artificial prey to determine how potential signaling constraints (specifically size and season) shape predation risk, and consequently the expression of ontogenetic color change in Papilio larvae. Seasonally, both predation and background greenness declined significantly from July to September, though there was little evidence that these patterns impacted the effectiveness of either color strategy. Caterpillar size and color strongly affected the attack rate of avian predators: attacks increased with prey size regardless of color, and eyespotted prey were attacked more than masquerading prey overall. These results may reflect a key size-mediated tradeoff between conspicuousness and intimidation in eyespotted prey, and raise questions about how interwoven aspects of behavior and signal environment might maintain the prevalence of large, eyespotted larvae in nature. © The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract={Large conspicuous eyespots on butterflywings have been shown to deter predators. This has been traditionally explained by mimicry of vertebrate eyes, but recently the classic eye-mimicry hypothesis has been challenged. It is proposed that the conspicuousness of the eyespot, not mimicry, is what causes aversion due to sensory biases, neophobia or sensory overloads.We conducted an experiment todirectly testwhether the eye-mimicry or the conspicuousness hypothesis better explain eyespot efficacy.We used great tits (Parusmajor) asmodel predator, and tested their reaction towards animated images on a computer display. Birds were tested against images of butterflies without eyespots, with natural-looking eyespots, and manipulated spots with the same contrast but reduced resemblance to an eye, as well as images of predators (owls) with and without eyes. We found that mimetic eyespots were as effective as true eyes of owls and more efficient in eliciting an aversive response than modified, less mimetic but equally contrasting eyespots. We conclude that the eye-mimicry hypothesis explains our results better than the conspicuousness hypothesis and is thus likely to be an important mechanism behind the evolution of butterfly eyespots. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract={Circular markings, called eyespots, on the wings of Lepidoptera have been shown to be protective against predators. We tested the 'conspicuousness-hypothesis' and 'eye mimicry-hypothesis' by examining how 'sparkle' and colour pattern of eyespots deter predators. The rationale was to test the deterring effect of shape and colour pattern of the eyespots' elements that are assumed to mimic lens eyes, namely iris, pupil, and sparkle by simultaneous exposure of lepidopteran dummies with equally conspicuous eyespots that differed in their similarity to lens eyes. The results provide evidence that circular and crescent-shaped 'sparkles' were more deterring than rectangular-shaped 'sparkles'. The 'sparkle's' UV-reflection had no effect on the deterrence. Our results support recent findings on the deterrent effect of the eyespot's 'sparkle' and show that colour is less important for deterrence. The characteristic colour pattern of eyespots and illusion of three-dimensionality created by the 'sparkle' might contribute to the deterrent effect. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.},

  abstract={It has long been believed that the paired circular markings ("eyespots") of Lepidoptera larvae, combined with their defensive postures (where the larvae swell their anterior body segments) protect them from potential predators. These traits could inhibit attacks by enhancing the similarity of the prey item to the predator's own natural enemies (notably snakes), but alternatively, they may simply exploit the predator's wariness of novel and/or conspicuous objects. To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey. In the first experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either without eyespots or with eyespots positioned in 1 of 2 locations on their bodies: anteriorly or centrally. In the second experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either lacking the thickening associated with the defensive posture, or with models in which a thickened section was placed centrally or anteriorly. In both cases, the chicks were significantly more wary of prey with anteriorly positioned defensive traits than either prey without these traits or prey with centrally positioned traits. Because prey with central eyespots and central thickening were equally novel and conspicuousness to those with these traits positioned in a more head-like anterior position, we infer that predator wariness was primarily influenced by the similarity of the prey to their potential natural enemies. These results support the idea that both caterpillar eyespots, and the defensive posture examined here, deter predators not simply because they are conspicuous, but because they enhance caterpillars' resemblance to potentially dangerous vertebrates. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

  abstract={Many caterpillars have conspicuous eye-like markings, called eyespots. Despite recent work demonstrating the efficacy of eyespots in deterring predator attack, a fundamental question remains: Given their protective benefits, why have eyespots not evolved in more caterpillars? Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars, we show that eyespots are associated with large body size. This relationship could arise because (i) large prey are innately conspicuous; (ii) large prey are more profitable, and thus face stronger selection to evolve such defenses; and/or (iii) eyespots are more effective on large-bodied prey. To evaluate these hypotheses, we exposed small and large caterpillar models with and without eyespots in a 2 x 2 factorial design to avian predators in the field. Overall, eyespots increased prey mortality, but the effect was particularly marked in small prey, and eyespots decreased mortality of large prey in some microhabitats. We then exposed artificial prey to naïve domestic chicks in a laboratory setting following a 2 x 3 design (small or large size x no, small, or large eyespots). Predators attacked small prey with eyespots more quickly, but were more wary of large caterpillars with large eyespots than those without eyespots or with small eyespots. Taken together, these data suggest that eyespots are effective deterrents only when both prey and eyespots are large, and that innate aversion toward eyespots is conditional. We conclude that the distribution of eyespots in nature likely results from selection against eyespots in small caterpillars and selection for eyespots in large caterpillars (at least in some microhabitats). © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

  abstract={Many prey use multicomponent deceptive signals to fool predators into mistaking them for inedible objects, toxic prey, or dangerous animals. However, recent experiments have suggested that multicomponent deceptive signals are no more effective in deterring predators than single-component signals, making it difficult to understand how they have evolved. Here, we use an established experimental system in which naive domestic chicks are presented with models of snake-mimicking caterpillars to test the idea that multicomponent deceptive signals reduce the speed at which predators learn that prey are profitable. We presented chicks with a series of 4 trials in which they encountered a single type of caterpillar model. The type of model differed among our 4 experimental groups that were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design: models either possessed eyespots or did not and were in either the resting or defensive posture. Chicks' responses to the same model prey were then retested following an extended 72-h retention period. Chicks rapidly attacked prey with no defensive traits and initially showed similar levels of wariness to prey with either 1 or 2 deceptive traits. However, chicks learned that single-trait caterpillars were profitable more quickly than 2-trait caterpillars and retained their learned responses better. This suggests that prey with multicomponent deceptive signals may have a selective advantage over prey with single-component deceptive signals when predators repeatedly encounter such prey. © 2015 The Author 2015.

  abstract={Background: Many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution. Work over the last decade has shown that a major function of eyespots is their ability to reduce predation by being intimidating to attacking predators. Two competing hypotheses seek to explain the cause of intimidation, one suggesting 'eye-mimicry' and the other their 'conspicuousness' as the reason. There is an on-going debate about which of these better explains the effectiveness of eyespots against predation. We undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots. We conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking Junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded. Results: We first established that birds avoided models with a pair of eyespots. However, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness. Non-eye-like, fan shaped patterns derived from eyespots were found to be just as effective as eye-like circular patterns. Furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work. However, across all experiments, models with a pair of patterns, symmetric or asymmetric, eyelike or non-eye-like, suffered from fewer attacks compared with other models. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in prey-predator signalling. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution. © 2015 Mukherjee and Kodandaramaiah; licensee BioMed Central.},

  abstract={Butterfly eyespots are known to function in predator deflection and predator intimidation, but it is still unclear what factors cause eyespots to serve one function over the other. Both functions have been demonstrated in different species that varied in eyespot size, eyespot number and wing size, leaving the contribution of each of these factors to butterfly survival unclear. Here, we study how each of these factors contributes to eyespot function by using paper butterfly models, where each factor is varied in turn, and exposing these models to predation in the field. We find that the presence of multiple, small eyespots results in high predation, whereas single large eyespots (larger than 6 mm in diameter) results in low predation. These data indicate that single large eyespots intimidate predators, whereas multiple small eyespots produce a conspicuous, but non-intimidating signal to predators. We propose that eyespots may gain an intimidation function by increasing in size. Our measurements of eyespot size in 255 nymphalid butterfly species show that large eyespots are relatively rare and occur predominantly on ventral wing surfaces. By mapping eyespot size on the phylogeny of the family Nymphalidae, we show that these large eyespots, with a potential intimidation function, are dispersed throughout multiple nymphalid lineages, indicating that phylogeny is not a strong predictor of eyespot size. © 2016 The Authors.},

  abstract={Many species of lepidoptera bear conspicuous circular patterns on their wings, known as eyespots, that are hypothesised to protect their bearers against predatory birds. In this study, we focus on a small but ubiquitous feature occurring naturally in lepidopteran eyespots, namely the so-called 'sparkle'. The 'pupil' in an eyespot is often highlighted by a 'sparkle', which is hypothesised to mimic a natural corneal total light reflection evident as a highlight, twinkle, or sparkle in the vertebrate eye. In a study exploring the presence of such sparkles, we found that 53% of lepidopteran eyespots exceeding 1mm in diameter have a central, pinpoint-like 'sparkle', 12% have a marginal, crescent-shaped 'sparkle', 13% have a semi-circular 'sparkle', and 22% have an intermediate semi-circular to crescent-shaped 'sparkle'. In the lepidopterans' natural resting position, the marginal 'sparkles' are positioned in the upper part of the eyespots''pupil' and thus may create the illusion of a spherical eyeball. The 'sparkles' in lepidopteran eyespots do not only appear white to humans, but also reflect ultraviolet light. White and UV-reflecting 'sparkles' also appear 'white' for UV-sensitive viewers such as birds, and thus may effectively mimic the natural highlight in vertebrate eyes as an area of total light reflection. In field experiments using lepidopteran dummies baited with a mealworm, we show that the 'sparkle' is one of several components of eyespots eliciting a deterrent effect and that eyespots with a 'sparkle' in a natural position have a stronger deterrent effect than those with a 'sparkle' in an unnatural position. These findings support the eye mimicry hypothesis that better vertebrate eye mimicry improves the deterrent effect of eyespots. © 2012 The Authors.

  abstract={Eyespots (patterns of roughly concentric rings) are often thought to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have lent support for the intimidation hypothesis by demonstrating a deterring effect of eyespots, but so far there is little evidence for the deflective effect (direction of attacks toward less vital body parts). We studied predators' responses towards large and small eyespots and towards prey with no, one, or a pair of eyespots and if this response is influenced by whether or not prey blend into background. In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators. In experiment 1, we found evidence for the deflective effect of small but not large eyespots, independent of whether the prey was presented on a concealing or exposing background. In experiment 2, we found that predators avoided the prey with a pair of small eyespots more than the prey without eyespots, but interestingly, we only found this deterring effect on the concealing background. There was no difference in attacks between the prey with one large and two small or one large and no eyespots. We conclude that deflective function may select for eyespots, and background may influence the deterring function of eyespots. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90. h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract={Various conspicuous signals in nature promote initial and learned avoidance by predators. It is widely thought that such signals are most effective when highly symmetrical in features such as size and shape, supported by recent laboratory experiments with domestic chicks and artificial prey. However, no study has investigated the effect of asymmetry on conspicuous signals in a natural setting, where viewing distances, angles, predator species, and light conditions vary and where predators encounter prey sequentially rather than simultaneously. We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field. Experiment 1 had treatments with symmetrical spots or with spots asymmetrical in area between 5 and 50%. All marked treatments survived better than unmarked controls, but there was no benefit of being symmetrical. Experiment 2 tested the effect of possessing markings asymmetrical for shape or position and any additive effect of these 2 features. Again, symmetry conferred no benefit and targets with markings asymmetrical for position and/or shape survived equally well as those with symmetrical arrangements. These findings indicate that asymmetry in warning signals may not be costly to prey in nature or be of less importance compared with other features of the signal, such as color and overall size. © The Author 2008.

  abstract={Animals utilise various strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including camouflage, warning colours and mimicry, and many of these protective signals promote avoidance behaviour in predators. For example, various species possess paired circular 'eyespots', which startle or intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. However, little is known of how the efficacy of such signals relates to the context in which they are found, and no studies have tested the relative effectiveness of anti-predator signals when on otherwise camouflaged and conspicuous prey. We find that the protective value of conspicuous wing spots, placed on artificial moth-like targets presented to wild birds in the field, is strongly affected by the attributes of the prey 'animal' on which they are found. Wing spots reduced predation when on conspicuous prey but were rendered ineffective when on otherwise camouflaged targets, indeed they increased the risk of predation compared to non-marked camouflaged controls. These results demonstrate how different anti-predator strategies may interact, and that protective signals can switch from being beneficial to costly under different contexts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Many animals are marked with conspicuous circular features often called 'eyespots', which intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. It has long been assumed that eyespots work by mimicking the eyes of larger animals, but recent experiments have indicated that conspicuousness and contrast is important in eyespot function, and not eye mimicry. We undertake two further experiments to distinguish between the conspicuousness and mimicry hypotheses, by using artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field. In experiment 1, we test if eyespot effectiveness depends on the marking shape (bar or circle) and arrangement (eye-like and non- eye-like positions). We find no difference between shapes or arrangement; all spots were equally effective in scaring birds. In experiment 2, we test if the often yellow and black colors of eyespots mimic the eyes of birds of prey. We find no effect of shape, and no advantage to yellow and black spots over non-eye-like but equally conspicuous colors. The consistent finding is that eyespot function lies in being a conspicuous signal to predators, and not necessarily due to eye mimicry. © 2009 Current Zoology.},

  abstract={Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract={Experiments in humans have shown that changes in emotional (affective) state cause adaptive changes in the processing of incoming information, termed "cognitive bias". For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with "pessimistic" judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling "threat call" (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds' behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract={Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract={Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals. © The Author 2008.

  abstract={The butterfly Bicyclus anynana exhibits phenotypic plasticity involving the wet-season phenotype, which possesses marginal eyespots on the ventral surface of the wings, and the dry-season form, which lacks these eyespots. We examined the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity of B. anynana in relation to the defence mechanisms of crypsis and deflection. We assessed the visibility differences between spotless and spotted butterflies against backgrounds of brown (dry season) or green (wet season) leaves. Spotless butterflies were highly cryptic and less predated by adult bird predators than were spotted ones when presented against brown leaf litter. However, the advantage of crypsis disappeared in the wet-season habitat as both forms were equally visible. In later experiments, naive birds presented with resting butterflies in the wet-season habitat tended to learn more rapidly to capture spotless butterflies, suggesting a slight selective advantage of possessing eyespots. Moreover, marginal eyespots increased significantly the escape probability of butterflies that were attacked by naive birds compared to those attacked by adult birds, although there were no differences in prey capture success within naive predators. Our results show that natural selection acts against eyespots in the dry season, favouring crypsis, whereas in the wet season it may favour eyespots as deflective patterns.},

  abstract={Previous studies that have looked at the aversive properties of simple, predator‐related, eye‐like patterns presented in an artificial context, have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate whether such stimuli had potential for use as bird scarers. The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species. The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area. Each subject was deprived of food for 5 h and then tested in an apparatus which exposed an eye pattern over a food trough immediately after the bird alighted on that trough. 10 measures of the starlings' feeding behaviour were monitored over a 1‐h trial. It was predicted that five of these variables would be positively and five negatively correlated with an increase in the fear evoking properties of the stimulus. The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be an ‘aversiveness index’. The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects. The main findings from the eight experiments are as follows. Simple eye‐like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity. The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused an 88% reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65% reduction in actual feeding time. The presence of ‘pupils’ in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversive than the control card. Once a pattern has the ‘pupil/iris’ distinction then a circular outline becomes important although the shape of the ‘pupil’ appears relatively unimportant. Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the ‘pupil’ and ‘iris’ appears irrelevant. Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed if the same stimuli are presented within the context of a simple head outline. Changing the orientation of a pair of eyes from horizontal to vertical only slightly reduces their aversiveness. The size of the patterns appears to be unimportant within the range tested. The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive. The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl. 1983 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

  abstract={Circular patterns, or eyespots, are common anti-predator features in a variety of animals. Two defensive functions have been documented: large eyespots may intimidate predators, whereas smaller marginal eyespots may divert attacks. However, a given eyespot potentially serves both functions, possibly depending on the predator's size and/or experience. Naive predators are potentially more likely to misdirect their attacks towards eyespots; alternatively, their typically smaller size would make them more intimidated by the same eyespots. Here we test how juvenile and sub-adult naive chickens respond to a single eyespot on a butterfly's wing. We presented the birds with dead wall brown butterflies, Lasiommata megera, that had their apical eyespot visible or painted over. We assessed the birds' responses' by (i) scoring their intimidation reaction, (ii) whether they uttered alarm calls and, (iii) if they attacked the butterfly and where they targeted their attacks. Results show that both age categories received higher intimidation scores when offered a butterfly with a visible eyespot. Juveniles were more intimidated by the butterfly than the sub-adults: they received higher intimidation scores and were more prone to utter alarm calls. Moreover, only sub-adults attacked and did so by preferentially attacking the butterfly's anterior. We demonstrate an intimidating effect of the type of eyespot that has previously been shown only to divert attacks. We suggest that one and the same eyespot may serve two functions relative to different predators; however, further experiments are needed to disentangle the role of predator identity and its link to size, ontogeny and experience},

We studied the effect of visual and auditory defence by staging experiments in which wild-caught blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were presented with one of six kinds of experimentally manipulated living peacock butterflies as follows: butterflies with eyespots painted over and their controls (painted on another part of the wing), butterflies with their sound production aborted (small part of wings removed) and their controls, and butterflies with eyespots painted over and sound production aborted and their controls. The results showed that eyespots alone, or in combination with sound, constituted an effective defence; only I out of 34 butterflies with intact eyespots was killed, whereas 13 out of 20 butterflies without eyespots were killed. The killed peacocks were eaten, indicating that they are not distasteful. Hence, intimidation by bluffing can be an efficient means of defence for an edible prey.},

  abstract={Small eyespots on butterflies have long been thought to deflect attacks, and birds are the presumptive drivers selecting for these patterns; however, evidence of this function is still ambiguous. Marginal eyespots typically consist of a UV-reflective white pupil, surrounded by one black and one yellowish ring. We have recently shown that Cyanistes caeruleus (blue tits) attack such eyespots, but only under low light intensities with accentuated UV levels: the increased salience of the eyespots relative to the rest of the butterfly probably explains this result. Possibly the background against which the butterfly is concealed may deceive birds to make similar errors. We therefore presented speckled wood butterflies decorated with eyespots (or controls without eyespots) to C.caeruleus against two backgrounds: oak and birch bark. Our results show that: (1) eyespots, independent of background, were effective in deflecting attacks; (2) the time elapsed between a bird landing and the attack was interactively dependent on the background and whether the butterfly bore an eyespot; and (3) the speed at which a butterfly was attacked predicted the outcome, with faster birds being more prone to errors than slower birds. This underscores a speedaccuracy trade-off in the predators, and that background plays a role in the defensive qualities of marginal eyespots.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 290297.},

  abstract={Many lepidopteran caterpillars appear to gain protection from insect-eating birds because they possess eyespots, a pair of conspicuous markings on the body generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator. Similarly, many caterpillars widen their anterior body segments when threatened, and this defensive posture may also deter attack because it emphasizes the caterpillar's eyes and/or allows the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely. Yet, given that this behaviour is not limited to caterpillars with eyespots, it is possible that the defensive posture may serve as a predator deterrent in itself. To disentangle the protective value of eyespots and widened anterior body segments, we created four types of artificial caterpillar in a 2x2 factorial design and deployed them on tree branches in the field where they were exposed to predation attempts by wild birds. The 'survivorship' of the artificial caterpillars was monitored over 90 h in six locations. We found a clear survival advantage for artificial prey with eyespots or a widened head shape. However, prey possessing both eyespots and a widened head did not survive longer than prey with either characteristic alone, suggesting that the traits did not act synergistically to deter attack. Interestingly though, only caterpillars in the eyespot-defensive posture treatment received more pecks directed towards the anterior 'head' region. Collectively, this study demonstrates clearly that caterpillars possessing either eyespots or widened anterior body segments are likely to experience reduced predation by wild birds, even at northern latitudes where there are relatively few arboreal snakes.

  abstract={Domestic chicks show fear and avoidance of certain monochromatic, two-dimensional eye-like shapes. The tranquilliser Pacitran (CIBA) will reduce fear-induced sterotypies an adult fowl and alleviate fear of a novel environment and startling stimulus (loud bell) in chicks (unpublished observation). The author tested whether fear and avoidance of the eye-shape could be reduced by the administration of Pacitran. Two hours before testing, each chick was injected subcutaneously with either 0.1 ml purified water (control group) or with 50 μg Pacitran in 0.1 ml water (approximately equivalent to 1.2 mg/kg body weight. Pacitran (Ciba) is a solution of methyl-18-epi-O-methylreserpate hydrochloride; it is a reserpine derivative and therefore a tranquilliser of rauwolfia-alkaloid type. Each chick was tested individually and once only; it was placed on an imaginary mid-line of the test box facing the eye model. Testing was carried out between 10.00 and 14.00 h; the order of testing was randomised and the box was turned between tests to reduce positional cues. Avoidance was evaluated by the accumulated time spent in each half of the box, 450 seconds in each half would indicate no avoidance. Immobility (freezing, sitting, lying, eye-closure), which is positively related to fear was decreased, while activity (steps, jumps) and vocalisation, which are inversely related to fear were enhanced by Pacitran. Chicks from both treatment groups avoided the eyeshape (P < 0.001; t test) but aversion was markedly stronger in the water-injected group. Thus, tranquillisation reduced fear and avoidance of the eye model.},

  abstract={The 'false head' hypothesis states that due to the posterior ventral wing markings of certain butterflies which resemble a 'false head', visually hunting predators, such as birds, are deceived into attacking the hind wing area rather than the true head of the butterfly. Six groups of artificially marked dead cabbage butterflies Pieris rapae were presented to blue jays Cyanocitta cristata. Of the six 'false head', markings, only the eyespot significantly influenced the point of attack. All of the 'false head' markings, however, led to a greater proportion of attacks to the hind wing area of the butterfly. In the course of prey handling following an initial attack, each of the 6 'false head' markings significantly directed predator handling strikes away from the true head of captive butterflies to the anal angle of the hind wing. In a 2nd experiment, live P. rapae with 'false head' markings were mishandled and thus escaped, significantly more frequently than controls. 'False head' markings may thus confer a selective advantage by increasing the probability of escape, particularly during handling.-from Authors},

  abstract={Animal camouflage is a textbook example of natural selection. Despite substantial progress, one historical theory remains controversial: that conspicuous "distractive" markings draw predator attention away from the prey outline, preventing detection. Here, we present evidence from 4 experiments to resolve this controversy. In field experiments, we measured bird predation on artificial cryptic prey that were either unmarked or had distractive markings of various attributes (number, color, and location). Prey with 3 high-contrast distractive markings, and with markings located away from the body outline, suffered reduced survival compared with unmarked controls or prey with low-contrast markings. There was no effect of small single markings with different colors on the survival of targets. In 2 computer-based experiments with human subjects searching for hidden targets, distractive markings of various types (number, size, and location) reduced detection times compared with controls. This effect was greatest for targets that had large or 3 markings. In addition, small and centrally placed markings facilitated faster learning. Therefore, these 2 experimental approaches show that distractive markings are detrimental to camouflage, both facilitating initial detection and increasing the speed of predator learning. Our experiments also suggest that learning of camouflaged prey is dependent on the type of camouflage present. Contrary to current and historical discussion, conspicuous markings are more likely to impair camouflage than enhance it, presenting important implications for the optimization of prey coloration in general.},

  abstract={Even if an animal matches its surroundings perfectly in colour and texture, any mismatch between the spatial phase of its pattern and that of the background, or shadow created by its three-dimensional relief, is potentially revealing. Nevertheless, for camouflage to be fully broken, the shape must be recognizable. Disruptive coloration acts against object recognition by the use of high-contrast internal colour boundaries to break up shape and form. As well as the general outline, characteristic features such as eyes and limbs must also be concealed; this can be achieved by having the colour patterns on different, but adjacent, body parts aligned to match each other (i.e. in phase). Such 'coincident disruptive coloration' ensures that there is no phase disjunction where body parts meet, and causes different sections of the body to blend perceptually. We tested this theory using field experiments with predation by wild birds on artificial moth-like targets, whose wings and (edible pastry) bodies had colour patterns that were variously coincident or not. We also carried out an experiment with humans searching for analogous targets on a computer screen. Both experiments show that coincident disruptive coloration is an effective mechanism for concealing an otherwise revealing body form.},

  abstract={1. Lepidoptera belonging to several different families bear eyespot patterns on their wings, often with a very strong resemblance to the vertebrate eye. These have been derived from different morphological structures in different groups, and their evolution is therefore convergent within the order. 2. A study of two individual hand-reared Yellow Buntings has shown that the pursuit of flying insect prey is fully released at the bird's first encounter with a flying butterfly, but that the orientation of the attack is modified by experience. 3. Eyespot patterns are associated with displays which exhibit them. In the case of a Nymphalid butterfly, Nymphalis io, an experiment has shown that the display releases escape responses from Yellow Buntings, and that the major part of this effect is due to the four ocelli on the upper surface of the fore- and hind wings. Experiments with other species of insects suggest that other factors contributing include the bright field of colour surrounding the eyespots, the rhythmic movements of the display, and the rustling noise which accompanies it. The bird's responses to this display waned rapidly in the majority of individuals, but some birds became conditioned to avoid the butterflies altogether. 4. Experiments with models showed that circular patterns presented suddenly to feeding birds (Chaffinches, Yellow Buntings and Great Tits) release escape responses more effectively than do non-circular patterns of the same area and perimeter. An increase in the perimeter of the models, achieved by the use of three concentric circles of the same area as the single circle, increased its releasing value. A flat, eye-like pattern which was so shaded and distorted as to appear three-dimensional was more effective than a similar flat pattern which was not shaded, and hence was more bright. Large models were more effective than similar small ones. Waning was again rapid. The differential responsiveness to circular and non-circular patterns is inborn in the case of Great Tits and Chaffinches. 5. An experiment with mealworms artifically ornamented with small eye-like spots at their extremities has shown that such markings, placed on a prey-object, tend to direct to themselves the attack of Yellow Buntings. The waning of the element of disturbed orientation in the responses is slow, and may not be significant. 6. The deflection and intimidation effects are discussed. The origin of the predator's responses to deflection marks is not known, but it is suggested that intimidating eyespots act by mimicking the eyes of the large avian predators preying on the small insectivorous passerines which are among their natural enemies. It has been shown that many small passerines possess inborn responses to their predators, and it is probable that these are "parasitised" by the eyespot patterns of insects. Eyespot patterns must be regarded as wholly distinct from pseudaposematic colouration. The effect of experience on small passerines, either of the predator-model or of an ocellated imitator, is most usually the reverse of that sustained by a predator encountering the model or mimic in a true case of Batesian or Mullerian mimicry, and the restrictions on the population size of a pseudaposematic insect relative to its model do not apply to insects utilising the inborn responses of their predators.},

By subjecting artificial 'butterflies' with different visual signals to predation from domestic chicks we show that the protective value of such visual warning displays is enhanced by increasing size of the signal pattern elements and decreased by pattern asymmetry. These results provide the first experimental evidence that predation may select for individual symmetry of visual warning displays, and concur with earlier demonstrations that asymmetric signals are more difficult to detect, learn, and remember, compared to symmetric signals. Collectively, our findings suggest that prey species possessing warning coloration should be subjected to selection for large and symmetric pattern elements.},

One hypothesis to account for an occurrence of eyespots is that these wing pattern elements are partly the outcome of visual selection by predators. Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) has underside spotting on its wings but there is also a seasonal form in which the eyespots are reduced in size or totally absent. This natural variation gives us a useful tool to test the hypothesis that marginal eyespot patterns can decoy the attacking predator by, at least sometimes, diverting attack from vital body parts to the edges of the wings. We used lizards, Anolis carolinensis, and pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, as predators for living spotted and spotless B. anynana. The presence of eyespots did not increase the escape probability of resting butterflies once captured (even a form with enlarged eyespots did not add to effective deflection of attacks). There was also no evidence that eyespots influenced the location of strikes by the predators. This study thus provides no support that marginal eyespot patterns can act as an effective deflection mechanism to avoid lizard or avian predation.},

  abstract={Large eyespots on the wings of butterflies and moths have been ascribed generally intimidating qualities by creating a frightening image of a bird or mammal much larger than the insect bearing the eyespots. However, evidence for this anti-predator adaptation has been largely anecdotal and only recently were peacock butterflies, Inachis io, shown to effectively thwart attacks from blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Here, we test whether large eyespots on lepidopterans are generally effective in preventing attacks from small passerines and whether the size of insect or bird can influence the outcome of interactions. We staged experiments between the larger eyed hawkmoths, Smerinthus ocellatus, and the smaller peacock butterflies, I. io, and the larger great tits, Parus major, and the smaller blue tits, P. caeruleus. Survival differed substantially between the insect species with 21 of 24 peacock butterflies, but only 6 of 27 eyed hawkmoths, surviving attacks from the birds. Thus, surprisingly, the smaller prey survived to a higher extent, suggesting that factors other than insect size may be important. However, great tits were less easily intimidated by the insects' eyespots and deimatic behaviour and consumed 16 of 26, but the blue tits only 8 of 25, of the butterflies and hawkmoths. Our results demonstrate that eyespots per se do not guarantee survival and that these two insects bearing equally large eyespots are not equally well protected against predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={The received view of protective coloration in animals is that conspicuous colors and patterns have evolved because they elicit avoidance behavior in potential predators. In the present study, we examine the spontaneous response of naive predators (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial prey to test the hypothesis that deviations from bilateral symmetry of signaling pattern elements may negatively influence the avoidance-inducing effect of conspicuous color patterns. Chicks displayed stronger aversions to artificial butterflyprey items possessing symmetric color pattern elements than to those possessing asymmetric signals with pattern elements of different color or shape. Although they attacked signals with a size asymmetry of 5% at the same rate as symmetric signals, signals with a size asymmetry of 7.5% or more were attacked more often than were symmetric signals. These results suggest that the protective value of conspicuous color patterns is impaired by asymmetry in color, shape, and size of color pattern elements. Our findings also argue against the notion that animals have inherent preferences for symmetric over asymmetric objects, and demonstrate the existence of a threshold for asymmetry detection, beyond which further increments in asymmetry have no influence on signal efficacy.},

  abstract={Large conspicuous eyespots have evolved in multiple taxa and presumably function to thwart predator attacks. Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to simply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted over. Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator. © 2012 The Author.},

In contrast to this, subjects trained on Catocala models did not startle to a novel grey hindwing. The startle response to Catocala patterns lasted over several days until birds habituated to the models. When the jays had habituated to one Catocala hindwing pattern, a novel Catocala pattern always elicited a startle response.

  abstract={Predation experiments have shown that the large eyespots (concentric rings of contrasting colors) found on the wings of several lepidopteran species intimidate passerine predators. According to the eye mimicry hypotheses, the intimidation is caused by predators associating the eyespots with the presence (of the eyes) of their own enemy. The conspicuousness hypothesis suggests, instead, that it is simply the conspicuousness of eyespot patterns that is intimidating, possibly due to a sensory bias. We studied how the number of eyespots, 2 or 4, influences intimidation. We predicted that if eye mimicry is important, the maximum response would be reached with a pair of eyespots. On the other hand, if conspicuousness is important, then more than 2 eyespots should result in an even stronger response. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, has 4 large eyespots on its wings. We presented naïve insectivorous birds (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca) 2 different prey items made from wings of dead peacock butterflies and a mealworm between the wings. One group of birds received prey that had no or only 2 eyespots visible and the other group received prey that had no or all 4 eyespots visible. Eyespots clearly increased hesitation before attacks. Because the birds were naïve, this difference in response to the eyespots was innate. Importantly, there was no difference in attack latency between 2 and 4 eyespots. We conclude that it is unlikely that conspicuousness as such has selected for eyespots in the peacock butterfly. © 2011 The Author.

  abstract={Background: Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions-in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities. © 2010 Olofsson et al.},
