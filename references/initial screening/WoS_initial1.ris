AB  - Background: Many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution. Work over the last decade has shown that a major function of eyespots is their ability to reduce predation by being intimidating to attacking predators. Two competing hypotheses seek to explain the cause of intimidation, one suggesting 'eye-mimicry' and the other their 'conspicuousness' as the reason. There is an on-going debate about which of these better explains the effectiveness of eyespots against predation. We undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots. We conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking Junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded.
   Results: We first established that birds avoided models with a pair of eyespots. However, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness. Non-eye-like, fan shaped patterns derived from eyespots were found to be just as effective as eye-like circular patterns. Furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work. However, across all experiments, models with a pair of patterns, symmetric or asymmetric, eyelike or non-eye-like, suffered from fewer attacks compared with other models.
   Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in prey-predator signalling. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution.

AB  - An approach for coordination and control of 3D heterogeneous formations of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles under hawk-eye-like relative localization is presented in this paper. The core of the method lies in the use of visual top-view feedback from flying robots for the stabilization of the entire group in a leader-follower formation. We formulate a novel model predictive control-based methodology for guiding the formation. The method is employed to solve the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader into a desired target region. In addition, the method is used for keeping the following vehicles in the desired shape of the group. The approach is designed to ensure direct visibility between aerial and ground vehicles, which is crucial for the formation stabilization using the hawk-eye-like approach. The presented system is verified in numerous experiments inspired by search-and-rescue applications, where the formation acts as a searching phalanx. In addition, stability and convergence analyses are provided to explicitly determine the limitations of the method in real-world applications.

AB  - An ''eye-spotted'' beach ball and a commercially available deterrent eye-spot ball significantly reduced the number of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) visiting a bird table to feed. The commercial ball had a greater deterrent effect than the beach ball at all four distances tested (10, 20, 30, and 40 m). The deterrent effect of both balls decreased with distance from the table, and was neglible at c. 40 m. Deterrence was increased 10% by illuminating the eyes with a rotating halogen light and by reinforcing the visual stimulus with alarm calls of blackbirds (Turdus merula), house sparrows, and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), but declined with continuous use, and disappeared altogether after 9 days. Eye-spot beach balls in a vineyard significantly reduced landings by song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) for 2 weeks, and landings by blackbirds, house sparrows, and starlings for 3 weeks. They failed, however, in the fourth week when the grapes were fully ripe and most in need of protection. Eye-spot balls are environmentally friendly, so could be especially useful bird scarers in organic vineyards and near residential areas.

AB  - Infrared (IR) transmissive moth eye-like substrates, including randomly patterned fused silica and various periodically patterned germanium substrates, were surface modified using a simple process. Goniometric analysis showed that the surface modification altered the surface wettability of each substrate, rendering them superhydrophobic. Following the surface modification, it was determined that the desirable IR transmission and antireflective properties of each substrate type were maintained. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity, IR transmission and antireflective capabilities of the substrates were shown to be significantly enhanced in comparison to native, non-patterned fused silica and germanium substrates that underwent the same processes. The results of this work provide an opportunity for the development of enhanced utility for infrared transmissive optics in wet or humid conditions.

AB  - Ability to recognize and differentiate between predators and non-predators is a crucial component of successful anti-predator behavior. While there is evidence that both genetic and experiential mechanisms mediate anti-predator behaviors in various animal species, it is unknown to what extent each of these two mechanisms are utilized by the green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Green monkeys on the West Indies island of Barbados offer a unique opportunity to investigate the underpinnings of anti-predator behaviors in a species that has been isolated from ancestral predators for over 350 years. In the first experiment, monkeys in two free-ranging troops were presented with photographs of an ancestral predator (leopard, Panthera pardus) and a non-predator (African Buffalo, Syncerus caffer). Relative to non-predator stimuli, images of a leopard elicited less approach, more alarm calls, and more escape responses. Subsequent experiments were conducted to determine whether the monkeys were responding to a leopard-specific feature (spotted fur) or a general predator feature (forward facing eyes). The monkeys showed similar approach to images of an unfamiliar non-predator regardless of whether the image had forward facing predator eyes or side facing non-predator eyes. However, once near the images, the monkeys were less likely to reach for peanuts near the predator eyes than the non-predator eyes. The monkeys avoided an image of spotted leopard fur but approached the same image of fur when the dark spots had been removed. Taken together, the results suggest that green monkey anti-predator behavior is at least partially mediated by genetic factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A large sample of trapped adult males of Hyalophora euryalus, H. columbia gloveri, and intergrades from a hybrid zone between these taxa were scored for seven categories of wing damage. A total of 6.1% of 471 adults showed wing damage consistent with bird strikes. Among categories of wing damage, a significantly higher frequency of strikes involved the HW discal spot and the apical eye spot. Patterns of wing damage and behavior of adults when threatened were evaluated in the context of formal models of wing markings as anti-predator mechanisms. Discal spots may act to intimidate predators, while apical eye spots may deflect attacks away from the body. Certain markings are highly conserved and concordant with DNA-based saturniid phylogeny.

TI  - SEEDLING BLIGHT OF SUGAR-CANE-A NEW DISEASE CAUSED BY HELMINTHOSPORIUM SACCHARI BUTLER
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The fungus Helminthosporium sacchari Butler, known to be the cause of eye spot, a common air-borne disease of sugar-cane leaves, is now shown to be the cause of an undescribed seed-borne disease of sugar-cane seedlings. It is therefore suggested that the disease should be renamed eye spot and seedling blight of sugar-cane.
   The symptoms of seedling blight are described, and the pathogenicity of the fungus to sugar-cane seedlings is confirmed. Incidence of seedling blight is shown to be markedly affected by the growing conditions, and disease-escape is common. The two most important factors predisposing seedlings to attack appear to be (i) the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and (ii) the occurrence of a check to the continuous growth of the seedlings.
   With the discovery of the existence of seedling blight, eye spot assumes a particular significance in plant-breeding plots, because it may be responsible for the loss of sugar-cane seedlings, any one of which is potentially a desirable new variety.

AB  - Although many previous studies have shown that eye-like images promote generosity, the mechanism of this "watching eyes effect" remains unclear. One possible cause is the concern for a good reputation as a generous person, while the other is the concerns for a bad reputation as a norm violator. To elucidate which of these two concerns is the main influencer, the present study conducted a laboratory experiment that investigated whether the watching eyes effect changed depending on social norms. If the concern for a good reputation leads to the effect, prosocial behavior would be more likely in the presence of watching eyes, regardless of the social norms involved. However, if the concern for avoiding a bad reputation as a norm violator leads to the effect, watching eyes promote prosocial behavior only in the existence of prosocial norms. In the original study, participants were asked to make a charitable donation under conditions in which eye-like images either were or were not present. In addition to the eye-like images, we manipulated prosocial norms by informing each participant of either high or low mean donation amounts given by previous participants. We found that watching eyes promoted donations only when a prosocial norm existed. This supports the idea that the watching eyes effect is caused by a concern for avoiding a bad reputation from violating norms. However, in a replication study, we were unable to replicate the original results; watching eyes did not promote generosity regardless of the norm. Taken together, we discussed the moderation effect of norms and the possibility of other moderators. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films with a moth-eye-like surface are coated with TiO2 particles to form self-cleaning antireflective films. The use of a TiO2 suspension of high concentration to coat the PET surface produces a thicker TiO2 layer with smaller pores, whereas a low concentration of a TiO2 suspension gives a thinner layer of TiO2 with larger pores. The PET films coated with TiO2 particles exhibit a high transmittance of 76-95% and almost no absorption in the range of 400-800 nm. The PET films coated with a TiO2 suspension with a concentration of >= 2 vol % exhibit superhydrophilicity after irradiation with UV light. After irradiation, the superhydrophilic nature is retained for at least 18 days. The TiO2-coated PET films showed the ability to decompose methylene blue under UV irradiation.

AB  - A navigation and stabilization scheme for 3D heterogeneous (UAVs and UGVs) formations acting under a hawk-eye like relative localization is presented in this paper. We formulate a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based concept for formation driving in a leader-follower constellation into a required target region. The formation to target region problem in 3D is solved using the MPC methodology for both: i) the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader, and ii) the control and stabilization of followers - UAVs and UGVs. The core of the method lies in a novel avoidance function based on a model of the formation respecting requirements of the direct visibility between the team members in environment with obstacles, which is crucial for the hawk-eye localization.

AB  - Animals often respond fearfully when encountering eyes or eye-like shapes. Although gaze aversion has been documented in mammals when avoiding group-member conflict, the importance of eye coloration during interactions between conspecifics has yet to be examined in non-primate species. Jackdaws (Corvus monedula) have near-white irides, which are conspicuous against their dark feathers and visible when seen from outside the cavities where they nest. Because jackdaws compete for nest sites, their conspicuous eyes may act as a warning signal to indicate that a nest is occupied and deter intrusions by conspecifics. We tested whether jackdaws' pale irides serve as a deterrent to prospecting conspecifics by comparing prospectors' behaviour towards nest-boxes displaying images with bright eyes (BEs) only, a jackdaw face with natural BEs, or a jackdaw face with dark eyes. The jackdaw face with BEs was most effective in deterring birds from making contact with nest-boxes, whereas both BE conditions reduced the amount of time jackdaws spent in proximity to the image. We suggest BEs in jackdaws may function to prevent conspecific competitors from approaching occupied nest sites.

AB  - Response of male eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermuller), to different ratios of synthetic sex pheromone components, (Z)-8-tetradecenyl acetate (Z8-14:OAc) and (Z)-8-tetradecenyl alcohol (Z8-14:OH), were compared in four North American locations and in one location in The Netherlands. In British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Michigan, and The Netherlands, a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH captured significantly more male S. ocellana than Z8-14:OAc alone or binary blends containing 10-50% Z8-14:OH. In Ontario, where population sizes were low compared to the other four locations, trends in trap catches were similar, and there was no indication that male S. ocellana responded differently to the tested pheromone blends. A 99:1 blend of Z8- 14:OAc and Z8-14:OH should be most effective in pheromone-based control programs of S. ocellana in North America and in The Netherlands. Our results confirm earlier studies that a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH captures significantly more male S. ocellana than Z8-14:OAc alone. However, our finding that a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH is significantly more attractive than binary blends containing 10-50% Z8-14:OH differs from previous findings in Germany and Switzerland.

AB  - A virtual ecosystem was developed using genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy systems. The ecosystem simulated and regulated the motions and interactions of computer animated agents in a virtual environment, Within the ecosystem, each agent has its own neural networks that govern its motion strategy so that the creature could learn to perform different behaviors, such as searching for food and evading predators. The inputs of the neural networks were connected with creatures' eye-like sensors and the outputs of the networks were attached to creatures' legs to drive the creatures. The neural networks were evolved using genetic algorithms, including single tournament selection, two-point crossover, and one point mutation. Augmented fuzzy cognitive maps regulated the overall operation of the environment and allowed each creature to switch between different neural networks for finding food and avoiding predators, The experimental results demonstrated that animated agents can evolve and learn how to survive in a complex and dynamic virtual environment.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Several species of raptors have two ocelli (eye-like patches) in the back of their head, giving them the appearance of a false face, although this trait has rarely been reported. According to our observations, these markings may be widespread in the family Falconidae, some Accipiter hawks, and some owls (e.g. Glaucidium, and some Athene, Aegolius, and Surnia). In this study, we outline general classes of hypotheses that may account for ocelli on the heads of raptors. The most frequently evoked general hypothesis is that ocelli offer protection against attackers. For example, a predator may abort the effort, be deflected by the ocelli, or be warned that the bearer will retaliate if attacked. We propose two alternatives. Most raptors with ocelli typically include a large proportion of passerine birds in their diets. The false faces may have evolved to aid in the hunting of small birds by actually provoking, or manipulating the nature of, a mobbing response. The benefit of doing so may either be immediate because there are numerous accounts of mobbers being killed, or the benefit may be postponed if the predator is using mobbing as a means of evaluating hunting prospects in a given area. An analysis of the pygmy-owls of the genus Glaucidium indicates that species displaying ocelli in the nape tend to have a high proportion of small birds in their diets and live in open habitats, whereas the opposite is true for species without ocelli. Pygmy-owls with ocelli are also considerably smaller and, collectively, these findings are most consistent with false faces being a conspicuous visual signal to deceive mobbing birds so they can be preyed upon.

AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to examine the effects of eye spots and stimulus movement as mediators of antipredator responses in garter snakes. In Experiment 1, 13 Eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) at 6-8 weeks of age were confronted with a series of threatening models that varied in the configuration of the eyes (artificial glass eyes, circular black spots, elongated black bars, or no eyespots). There were significant differences in the number of strikes elicited by the models, and the model with realistic glass eyes elicited the most strikes. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of erratic and consistent stimulus movement on defensive behavior in 12 garter snakes at 12-16 weeks of age. The snakes delivered significantly more strikes to an erratically moving model than to a model oscillated at a regular rate.

AB  - Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions.

AB  - Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Silicon (Si) affects the susceptibility of plants to fungal attack. In plants with low Si accumulation, disease-control mechanisms involve the accumulation of phenolic compounds and Si. This study compared the effects of calcium silicate and carbonate doses on the control of soybean (Glycine max) diseases. A sandy soil was collected from Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, of which 200 kg was placed in plastic drums in a protected, uncovered area. Calcium carbonate or silicate was applied superficially in amounts equivalent to 0, 1500, 3000, 6000, or 12,000 kg ha(-1), and soybean was cultivated for 120 d. Leaf Si concentration and incidence of Cercospora sojina (Frog's eye spot), Peronospora manshurica (downy mildew), and Phakopsora pachyrhizi (Asian rust) were evaluated. Calcium carbonate did not reduce disease incidence; however, calcium silicate was effective in the reduction of downy mildew at 47 and 66 d after soybean seeding, and of frog's eye spot incidence at all dates evaluated. Asian rust was observed only at 79 d after seeding and calcium silicate was not effective in its reduction.

T2  - COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - Coloration in adult diurnal tiger beetles has been proposed to function in crypsis, disruption by iridescence, mimicry, and thermoregulation.  Observations on two Tunisian tiger beetles suggested that parasematic coloration may also occur.  Eyespot patterns in these species may function in deflection of predator attacks to the apical part of the body leading to a higher probability of survival of the beetle.  The significance of this mechanism in a number of eye-spotted cicindelids is discussed.  Overlap between the different functions may be the cause of the extraordinary diversity of tiger beetle coloration.

AB  - Binary and ternary combinations of volatile organic compounds identified earlier from caterpillar-infested apple foliage caught more than one thousand individuals of both sexes of several adult tortricid leafroller species in several days of trials conducted in apple orchards in southern British Columbia. A series of combinations with phenylacetonitrile, benzyl alcohol, and/or 2-phenylethanol and acetic acid enabled substantial catches of both sexes of eye-spotted budmoth, Spilonota ocellana, oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana and three-lined leafroller, Pandemis limitata. These findings suggest that new monitoring aides can be developed to seasonally track populations, enabling practical applications in surveillance of female leafroller populations for the first time. It may also be possible to develop suppression tools based on combinations of kairomone compounds originally identified from leafroller larval-damaged apple trees, given the level of attraction. The discovery of these adult tortricid attractants (aromatic compounds plus acetic acid) raises new ecological questions about evolved direct plant defences against herbivores. Larval feeding-induced attraction of adult herbivores produces signals that are potentially harmful to the plant by increasing herbivory in the same family and probably feeding guild, but evidence for effects on plant fitness is needed.

AB  - Eyespots (color patterns resembling eyes) are present in many taxa and often have important ecological functions. In some taxa, potential functions of eyespots have not been extensively examined, as is the case with pygmy-owls (Glaucidium spp.), many of which bear a conspicuous eye-like pattern on their nape. Using wooden replicas of Northern Pygmy-Owls (G. gnoma), with and without eyespots, we tested one potential function: whether eyespots affect mobbing behaviors of small forest birds. We measured the orientation of mobbing behaviors (where birds perched and flew at the model) and intensity of mobbing bouts (duration of bouts and number of mobbing individuals). Eyespots affected the most proximal behavior, close passing (flights directly at the model, resulting in an approach within 0.5 m). When eyespots were present, mobbers shifted away from eyespots, providing the first empirical evidence for a link between eyespots and avian mobbing.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to study the efficacy of six fungicides comprising contact, systemic and botanical fungicides and three biocontrol agents for the management of bird's eye spot disease in tea plantations. Among 16 treatments, systemic fungicides were found to be superior to biocontrol agents in controlling the disease whereas the maximum green leaf yield was significantly increased in those applied with biocontrol agents. On the whole, Streptomyces sannanensis offered the maximum yield of 3998 kg ha(-1) made tea followed by Trichoderma harzianum (3884 kg ha-1 made tea). Between the two different carrier materials evaluated for the application of biocontrol agents, vermicompost-based bioformulation showed better efficacy than talc-based formulation. Of the three (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) groups of biocontrol agents, S. sannanensis was better than Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma atroviride belonging to bacterial and fungal antagonists; respectively in terms of disease protection and increasing yield potential. Similarly, the biometric, physiological and biochemical parameters were also increased in plants greatly after imposing various treatments. Plucking surface of the bush, number of plucking points per unit area, internodal length, leaf moisture and dry matter contents were found higher in plots applied with biocontrol agents than those treated with fungicides. Almost all of the tea quality parameters such as total liquor colour, thearubigins, theaflavins, highly polymerized substance and caffeine were significantly improved in biocontrol treated plants. Theaflavin and thearubigin contents were increased in the range of 9.00-9.57% and 1.27-1.54% respectively in vermin based treatment. Similarly the amount of caffeine content (3.66-4.08%) and flavour index (4.18-5.31%) were considerably enhanced. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individuals of many prey species adjust their foraging behavior in response to the presence of a predator. Responding to predators takes time away from searching for and exploiting food resources. To balance between the need to avoid predation and the need to forage, individuals should attend to cues from predators that indicate risk. Two such cues might be the predator's head orientation (where it might be looking) and body orientation (where it might be moving). In the current study, flocks of Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, and tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, were presented with perched hawk and owl models. Predator model head and body orientation were independently manipulated relative to a feeding station birds were using. Chickadees and titmice avoided the feeders more when the heads of the models were facing toward the feeders compared to facing away from the feeders. Calling behavior of birds was also affected by head orientation of the models. No effect of predator body orientation on chickadee and titmouse behavior was detected. The results indicate that when chickadees and titmice detect a perched avian predator, they assess risk primarily based upon its head orientation.

AB  - Y In the period 2019-2020 at the Fruit Research & Development Station Bistrita observations have been made constantly in apple and other fruit trees orchards. As a consequence, besides the usual apple pests and diseases such as: the codling moth, the San Jose scale, woolly apple aphid, scab, powdery mildew and brow rot, new threatening pests were detected. They are a part of the Lepidopterae order and did not represent a major problem in the past. Male adults of Spilonota ocellana (eye-spotted bud moth) were caught on pheromone traps placed in a nearby plum orchard, for monitoring the flight of Cydia funebrana, in the years 2019-2020. The number of captures was 53 in 2019 and 159 in 2020 per trap. In 2019 the damage was sporadically encountered both on leaves and fruits but in 2020 the damage was significantly higher. On some apple cultivars the fruits were damaged up to 23,23%. Data suggest the need for control measures to be taken especially in the second part of the summer.

AB  - Many avian species are considered agricultural pests and cause severe and costly damage to crops worldwide. Crop producers use several methods to reduce damage by birds, with frightening devices serving among the most popular approaches. Biologically salient frightening devices, such as broadcast of conspecific alarm calls or placing predator models in fields, are considered particularly effective because they can trigger antipredator behaviors that reduce foraging activities or abundances of target birds locally. However, it remains unclear which type of biologically salient frightening device is most effective and whether some work best against certain bird species or on certain types of crops. We reviewed the published scientific literature to fill in these knowledge gaps about using biologically salient frightening devices for crop protection against avian pests. We found 48 experiments evaluating the impact(s) of biologically salient frightening devices. However, only 28 experiments statistically tested their results from which to draw conclusions. We found that alarm call playbacks, eye-spot balloons, or automated flying vehicles (UAVs) reduced avian abundance in all experiments. All experiments using alarm call playbacks, eye-spot balloons, hawk-kites, or UAVs effectively reduced crop damage. However, only experiments on passerine birds and in row crops were well-represented in these studies. We discuss potential biases in the literature that may limit our understanding of how birds respond to biologically salient frightening devices and suggest future directions that researchers might take to fill knowledge gaps.

AB  - The effectiveness of a visual birdscarer, the Peaceful Pyramid, relative to a much-cheaper eye-spot balloon was investigated experimentally in two vineyards in Canterbury, New Zealand. Monitoring of bird damage to natural bunches of Riesling grapes within vineyard blocks showed that the rate of starling (Sturnus vulgaris) damage to the crop was reduced significantly by the balloon relative to pyramid and control plots. Nevertheless, after 24 days of monitoring, birds in the balloon plot had damaged 75% of the grapes, respectively (cf. 84% in the pyramid plot). In a second trial, clusters of table grapes were attached to vineyard wire at a Lincoln vineyard. The balloon and pyramid both reduced bird damage to clusters within 15 m of the device, but had no measurable effect on clusters further away. We conclude that neither device would provide growers with any economically significant reduction in grape damage. This study highlights the importance of undertaking quantitative assessments of the numerous bird-scaring technologies presently available to growers.

AB  - Kittens were monocularly deprived to give a partial shift in the ocular dominance histo,grams from their visual cortices. Responses were measured for the normal and deprived eyes at a variety of contrasts, and curves fitted to give measurements of background activity and peak visual response. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) was then applied, and the effect on the contrast-response curves was measured, and compared in the two eyes. In normal animals, the effect of APV on the contrast-response curve was similar in the two eyes. In monocularly deprived animals, on average, peak visual response was affected similarly in the two eyes, although there was wide variability from cell to cell. When the effect of APV on background activity was measured, there was a difference between the normal and deprived eyes. APV reduced background activity in the normal eye more than it reduced background activity in the deprived eye. In other words, the NMDA contribution to background activity in the deprived eye was reduced compared to the NMDA contribution to background activity in the normal eye. This could represent a reduction of NMDA receptors in the pathway from the deprived eye, like the reduction of acetylcholine receptors associated with the losing input at the neuromuscular junction before the nerve is eliminated.

AB  - Many animals alter their anti-predator behavior in accordance to the threat level of a predator. While much research has examined variation in mobbing responses to different predators, few studies have investigated how anti-predator behavior is affected by changes in a predator's own state or behavior. We examined the effect of sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) behavior on the mobbing response of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) using robotic taxidermy sparrowhawks. We manipulated whether the simulated predator moved its head, produced vocalizations, or held a taxidermy blue tit in its talons. When any sparrowhawk model was present, blue tits decreased foraging and increased anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. Additionally, each manipulation of the model predator's state (moving, vocalizing, or the presence of a dead conspecific) impacted different types of blue tit anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. These results indicate that different components of mobbing vary according to the specific state of a given predator-beyond its presence or absenceand suggest that each might play a different role in the overall mobbing response. Last, our results indicate that using more life-like predator stimuli-those featuring simple head movements and audio playback of vocalizations-changes how prey respond to the predator; these 'robo-raptor' models provide a powerful tool to provide increased realism in simulated predator encounters without sacrificing experimental control.
   Significance statement
   Anti-predatory behavior is often modulated by the threat level posed by a particular predator. While much research has tested how different types of predators change prey behavior, few experiments have examined how predator behavior affects anti-predatory responses of prey. By experimentally manipulating robotic predators, we show that blue tits not only respond to the presence of a sparrowhawk, by decreasing feeding and increasing anti-predator behavior and vocalizations, but that they vary specific anti-predator behaviors when encountering differently behaving predators (moving, vocalizing, or those with captured prey), suggesting that prey pay attention to their predators' state and behavior.

AB  - Eyespots (patterns of roughly concentric rings) are often thought to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have lent support for the intimidation hypothesis by demonstrating a deterring effect of eyespots, but so far there is little evidence for the deflective effect (direction of attacks toward less vital body parts). We studied predators' responses towards large and small eyespots and towards prey with no, one, or a pair of eyespots and if this response is influenced by whether or not prey blend into background. In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators. In experiment 1, we found evidence for the deflective effect of small but not large eyespots, independent of whether the prey was presented on a concealing or exposing background. In experiment 2, we found that predators avoided the prey with a pair of small eyespots more than the prey without eyespots, but interestingly, we only found this deterring effect on the concealing background. There was no difference in attacks between the prey with one large and two small or one large and no eyespots. We conclude that deflective function may select for eyespots, and background may influence the deterring function of eyespots.

AB  - The most striking feature of peafowl (Pavo) is the males' elaborate train, which exhibits ocelli (ornamental eyespots) that are under sexual selection. Two additional genera within the Phasianidae (Polyplectron and Argusianus) exhibit ocelli, but the appearance and location of these ornamental eyespots exhibit substantial variation among these genera, raising the question of whether ocelli are homologous. Within Polyplectron, ocelli are ancestral, suggesting ocelli may have evolved even earlier, prior to the divergence among genera. However, it remains unclear whether Pavo, Polyplectron and Argusianus form a monophyletic clade in which ocelli evolved once. We estimated the phylogeny of the ocellated species using sequences from 1966 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and three mitochondrial regions. The three ocellated genera did form a strongly supported clade, but each ocellated genus was sister to at least one genus without ocelli. Indeed, Polyplectron and Galloperdix, a genus not previously suggested to be related to any ocellated taxon, were sister genera. The close relationship between taxa with and without ocelli suggests multiple gains or losses. Independent gains, possibly reflecting a pre-existing bias for eye-like structures among females and/or the existence of a simple mutational pathway for the origin of ocelli, appears to be the most likely explanation.

AB  - The potential for pheromone-based mating disruption of eye-spotted bud moth (ESBM), Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in apple orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia was examined in small-plot trials. In a preliminary experiment, treatment of the orchard atmosphere with a 99:1 blend of Z8-tetradecenyl acetate (Z8-14:OAc) and Z8-tetradecenyl alcohol (Z8-14:OH) completely inhibited captures of male ESBM in pheromone-baited traps, but treatment with Z8-14:OAc alone did not. Therefore, all subsequent trials used the two-component blend as a disruptant. Mean catches of male ESBM in traps baited with 0.1, 1, 10, or 20 mg of 99:1 Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH were significantly reduced (81-97%) in pheromone-treated plots relative to similar traps placed in control plots. In both control and treated plots, there was a significant positive relationship between trap bait dose and trap catch. In pheromone-treated plots, this suggests that high doses of trap baits override the camouflage effect of disruption or overcome the effect of sensory adaptation and habituation. The number of virgin-female baited traps capturing at least one male ESBM was reduced by 96%, and mating of virgin females on mating tables was reduced by 95% in plots treated with the two-component pheromone. The total amount of Z8-14:OAc released from pheromone disruption dispensers during the latter field trials was estimated to average 6.4 g ha(-1) over 11 days or 26.4 mg ha(-1) h(-1). The low levels of Z8-14:OH released from disruption dispensers could not be estimated by GC analysis. Dispensers loaded with a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH were highly attractive to males in baited traps, indicating that they have the potential to induce false trail following.

AB  - A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90 h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour.

AB  - Many caterpillars have conspicuous eye-like markings, called eyespots. Despite recent work demonstrating the efficacy of eyespots in deterring predator attack, a fundamental question remains: Given their protective benefits, why have eyespots not evolved in more caterpillars? Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars, we show that eyespots are associated with large body size. This relationship could arise because (i) large prey are innately conspicuous; (ii) large prey are more profitable, and thus face stronger selection to evolve such defenses; and/or (iii) eyespots are more effective on large-bodied prey. To evaluate these hypotheses, we exposed small and large caterpillar models with and without eyespots in a 2 x 2 factorial design to avian predators in the field. Overall, eyespots increased prey mortality, but the effect was particularly marked in small prey, and eyespots decreased mortality of large prey in some microhabitats. We then exposed artificial prey to naive domestic chicks in a laboratory setting following a 2 x 3 design (small or large size x no, small, or large eyespots). Predators attacked small prey with eyespots more quickly, but were more wary of large caterpillars with large eyespots than those without eyespots or with small eyespots. Taken together, these data suggest that eyespots are effective deterrents only when both prey and eyespots are large, and that innate aversion toward eyespots is conditional. We conclude that the distribution of eyespots in nature likely results from selection against eyespots in small caterpillars and selection for eyespots in large caterpillars (at least in some microhabitats).

AB  - A long term experiment has taken place 1967 at Changins to test different cropping techniques supposed to avoid the disadvantages of wheat monoculture. From 1977, three additional treatments have been added to the experiment: an unploughed crop rotation Wheat-Rape-Wheat-Maize, a ploughed crop rotation Wheat-Rape-Wheat-Maize and a ploughed crop rotation Wheat-Rape-Wheat-Oat. The yield decline in the wheat monoculture from 1969 to 1977 reached 33% (17 dt/ha) in the ploughed treatment and 25% (14.2 dt/ha) in the unploughed treatment. From 1978 to 2004, the average wheat yield of the three treatments including a crop rotation where quite similar at a level of 56 dt/ha. During the same period of time, the yield of the wheat monoculture reached 48.3 dt/ha in the ploughed treatment and 49.8 dt/ha in the unploughed treatment.
   Different techniques of straw management, nitrogen fertilization and stubble-cleaning have been sequentially tested in order to minimize the disadvantages of the wheat monoculture as well as crop rotations with high wheat proportion. No practical conclusion could be derived from the results.

AB  - Animals may update their assessment of predation risk according to how a potential predator approaches them. For example, the predator's head and gaze orientation (direction of attention) may reveal its intentions, and faster-approaching predators are likely to represent greater risk. We examined the reactions of hadeda ibises Bostrychia hagedash. These large birds demonstrate a wide repertoire of responses to being approached (e. g. continuing to forage, slow walking, rapid escape walking, flight and alarm calling). Birds were approached tangentially 112 times by a human who either had the head and eyes directed towards (65 approaches) or directed away from (47 approaches) the birds to test the hypothesis that the direction of the observer's attention informs alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) in these birds. Direction of attention had a significant effect on AD and FID as well as the likelihood of taking flight and alarm calling by hadedas, with birds appearing to associate attention directed towards them as an indication of increased risk. Hadedas were able to differentiate between the direction of attention of an approaching human, whether or not there were multiple other humans in the near vicinity. We also examined whether the observer's approach speed altered the birds' responses. Approach speed affected the birds' FID, suggesting that they perceive greater danger in a faster-approaching intruder compared with a slower-walking one. These results support the predictions of optimal escape theory and emphasize the high resolution of antipredatory awareness in these birds. The marked success of hadeda ibises in urban environments may be due to their ability to become habituated to human presence and to modify their antipredator behaviour in response to subtle cues. These may be common traits of bird species that successfully adapt to urban environments.

AB  - The presence of subtle cues of being watched has been reported to make people behave altruistically, even when they are anonymous. Individual selection theory predicts that generosity in the presence of eyes is based on the providers' expectation of a future reward. On the other hand, as we are living in quite a large society in which altruistic punishment is effective, the eyes could elicit fear of punishment. However, no previous study has investigated whether people are concerned with their reputation when subtle social cues are present. We conducted the dictator game in the presence of, or without, a painting of stylized eyes. The participants were then asked to complete a post-experimental questionnaire designed to investigate what they were thinking when they decided the amount of money to offer the recipient and how they perceived the experimental situation. Participants in the eye condition allocated more money to the recipient than did those in the control condition. This effect was not mediated by fear of punishment but by the expectation of a reward. Moreover, the results suggested that the participants expected their actions would enhance their reputation in the eyes of a third party. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The function of anti-predator signalling is a complex, and often-overlooked, area of animal communication. The goal of this study was to examine the behavioural function of an anti-predator acoustic signal in the ocean. We observed the acoustic and defensive behaviours of California spiny lobsters (Palinuridae: Panulirus interruptus) to a model predator, model conspecific and blank pole, both in the tank and in the field. We found that P. interruptus make a 'rasp' sound once physically contacted by an aggressor, rather than during the approach. The model predator and conspecific elicited no discernable changes in defensive behaviour, but the responses by the lobsters to aggressors in the tank versus field were distinct. Our results indicate that the spiny lobster's rasp is used as a startle or aposematic signal, which may be coupled with visual aposematism of their spines. Alternatively, the rasp may function as a vibratory escape mechanism or as an acoustic analogue to eye-spots. This study offers insights into the role of acoustic signalling in the marine environment and demonstrates a central role for sound production in spiny lobster ecology.

AB  - Individuals often produce alarm or mobbing calls when they detect a threat such as a predator. Little is known about whether such calling is affected by the facial orientation of a potential threat, however. We tested for an effect of facial orientation of a potential threat on tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, a songbird that uses chick-a-dee calls in a variety of social contexts. In two studies, a human observer wore an animal mask that either faced or faced away from the focal bird(s). In Study 1, focal birds were individual titmice captured in a walk-in trap, and the observer stood near the trapped bird. In Study 2, focal birds were titmouse flocks utilizing a feeding station and the observer stood near the station. In both studies, calling behavior was affected by mask orientation. In Study 2, foraging and agonistic behavior were also affected. Titmice can therefore perceive the facial orientation of a potential threat, and this perception affects different behavioral systems, including calling. Our results indicate sensitivity of titmice to the facial orientation of a potential predator in two quite different motivational contexts. This work suggests the possibility of strategic signaling by prey species depending upon the perceptual space of a detected predator.

AB  - Applications of the two IGR's diflubenzuron and fenoxycarb timed against codling moth Cydia pomonella were compared in the last three years in various trials (multiannual trials and detail trials) in their effect on different pests. Both products showed an excellent control of the key pest the codling moth even with only one application per season. Good control of small ermine moth Yponomeuta malinellus as well as a suppression of the apple leaf sucker Cacopsylla mali and the casebearer moth Coleophora spp. was achieved with both products applied in June. Diflubenzuron attained good control of the apple leaf miner Lyonetia clerkella. On the other hand fenoxycarb showed a good ovicidal activity on the smaller fruit tortrix Grapholita lobarzewskii and a partial effect on mussel scales Lepidosaphes ulmi. Populations of eye-spotted bud moth Spilonota ocellana were clearly reduced the year following the fenoxycarb treatment in previous June.

AB  - Sensitivity to the gaze of other individuals has long been a primary focus in sociocognitive research on humans and other animals. Information about where others are looking may often be of adaptive value in social interactions and predator avoidance, but studies across a range of taxa indicate there are substantial differences in the extent to which animals obtain and use information about other individuals' gaze direction. As the literature expands, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make comparisons across taxa as experiments adopt and adjust different methodologies to account for differences between species in their socioecology, sensory systems and possibly also their underlying cognitive mechanisms. Furthermore, as more species are found to exhibit gaze sensitivity, more terminology arises to describe the behaviours. To clarify the field, we propose a restricted nomenclature that defines gaze sensitivity in terms of observable behaviour, independent of the underlying mechanisms. This is particularly useful in nonhuman animal studies where cognitive interpretations are ambiguous. We then describe how socioecological factors may influence whether species will attend to gaze cues, and suggest links between ultimate factors and proximate mechanisms such as cognition and perception. In particular, we argue that variation in sensory systems, such as retinal specializations and the position of the eyes, will determine whether gaze cues ( e. g. head movement) are perceivable during visual fixation. We end by making methodological recommendations on how to apply these variations in socioecology and visual systems to advance the field of gaze research.

AB  - The ability to distinguish among heterospecific individuals has been reported in only a few animal species. Humans can be viewed as a special type of heterospecifics because individuals differ widely in behavior, ranging from non-threatening to very threatening toward animals. In this study, we asked whether wild magpies can recognize individual humans who had accessed their nests. We compared the behavior of breeding pairs toward individual humans before and after the humans climbed up to the birds' nests, and also toward climbers and non-climbers. We have evidence for (i) aggressive responses of the magpie pairs toward humans who had repeatedly accessed their nests (climbers) and a lack of response to humans who had not accessed the nest (non-climbers); (ii) a total lack of scolding responses toward climbers by magpie pairs whose nests had not been accessed; (iii) a selective aggressive response to the climber when a climber and a non-climber were presented simultaneously. Taken together, these results suggest that wild magpies can distinguish individual humans that pose a threat to their nests from humans that have not behaved in a threatening way. The magpie is only the third avian species, along with crows and mockingbirds, in which recognition of individual humans has been documented in the wild. Here, we propose a new hypothesis (adopted from psychology) that frequent previous exposure to humans in urban habitats contributes to the ability of birds to discriminate among human individuals. This mechanism, along with high cognitive abilities, may predispose some species to learn to discriminate among human individuals. Experimental tests of these two mechanisms are proposed.

AB  - Radford et al. monitored cattle marked with artificial eyespots in non-commercial cattle farms in northern Botswana, and demonstrate that cattle with these eyespot markings were more likely to avoid predation by large carnivores. Their findings have applications as a cost-effective tool to reduce livestock predation by ambush predators.
   Eyespots evolved independently in many taxa as anti-predator signals. There remains debate regarding whether eyespots function as diversion targets, predator mimics, conspicuous startling signals, deceptive detection, or a combination. Although eye patterns and gaze modify human behaviour, anti-predator eyespots do not occur naturally in contemporary mammals. Here we show that eyespots painted on cattle rumps were associated with reduced attacks by ambush carnivores (lions and leopards). Cattle painted with eyespots were significantly more likely to survive than were cross-marked and unmarked cattle, despite all treatment groups being similarly exposed to predation risk. While higher survival of eyespot-painted cattle supports the detection hypothesis, increased survival of cross-marked cattle suggests an effect of novel and conspicuous marks more generally. To our knowledge, this is the first time eyespots have been shown to deter large mammalian predators. Applying artificial marks to high-value livestock may therefore represent a cost-effective tool to reduce livestock predation.

AB  - The quality of human contact that hens are exposed to will determine the degree of fear of humans that they experience. This has consequences for the welfare of commercial laying hens, as hens that are afraid of humans will be regularly exposed to a fear-provoking stressor. Hens can be habituated to human presence using positive or neutral human-animal interactions, although the specific human behaviours that are considered positive or neutral by the hens are still being determined. This experiment investigated whether the proximity or duration of visual contact with a human affected fear of humans in commercial caged laying hens (n = 216). Commercial laying hens were exposed to daily visual human contact at one of three proximities (0, 0.75 or 1.50 m) and one of three durations (2, 30 or 90 s) in a 3 by 3 factorial design for a period of 28 days. Avoidance behaviour was assessed on Days -5, 15 and 30, and the plasma corticosterone response to handling was assessed on Days -5 and Day 30. Visual contact with a stationary human at close proximity (0 m) significantly (P = 0.03) reduced the avoidance response of commercial laying hens to an approaching human, although there was no clear effect of proximity on corticosterone response to handling. The duration of human contact had no effect on avoidance behaviour or corticosterone response. Stockpeople may consider working more closely to the cages in a non-threatening manner to reduce fear of humans in their flock.

AB  - Defenses protect prey, while offenses arm predators. Some defenses and offenses are constitutive (e.g. tortoise shells), while others are phenotypically plastic and not always expressed (e.g. neckteeth in water fleas). All of them are costly and only adaptive at certain prey densities. Here, I analyse such density-dependent effects, applying a functional response model to categorize defenses and offenses and qualitatively predict at which prey densities each category should evolve (if it is constitutive) or be expressed (if it is phenotypically plastic). The categories refer to the step of the predation cycle that a defense or offense affects: (1) search, (2) encounter, (3) detection, (4) attack, or (5) meal. For example, prey warning signals such as red coloration prevent predator attacks and are hence step 4 defenses, while sharp predator eyes enhance detection and are step 3 offenses. My theoretical analyses predict that step I defenses, which prevent predators from searching for their next meal (e.g. toxic substances), evolve or are expressed at intermediate prey densities. Other defenses, however, should be most beneficial at low prey densities. Regarding predators, step 1 offenses (e.g. immunity against prey toxins) are predicted to evolve or be expressed at high prey densities, other offenses at intermediate densities. 1 provide evidence from the literature that supports these predictions.

AB  - Birds, due to their multiple colourful displays, constitute a classic paradigm for the study of colour evolution. Although avian eyes are remarkably coloured, the functional basis behind inter-specific variability in iris colouration remains poorly understood. Owls are an ideal system to shed light on the role of ecology in promoting iris colour evolution as they show inter-specific variation in iris colour and in niche specialization with some species being strictly nocturnal and others active during the day. Owls perching for hunting at night might be unnoticed by both predators and their prey if they had dark irises, which would predict that dark irises were more likely to evolve in strictly nocturnal species than in diurnal ones. Using phylogenetic comparative models, we tested the camouflage hypothesis for eye colour. The proportion of dark-eyed owl species is higher among strictly nocturnal owls than among diurnal ones. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that the owl ancestor of the family Strigidae was more likely bright-irided whereas the ancestor of the family Tytonidae was more likely dark-irided. Our results show robust support for the coevolution of iris coloration and nocturnality in the owls, and suggest that shifting to a nocturnal niche would be a prerequisite leading to the evolution of dark eyes in owls. The specific evolutionary pathway by which iris coloration and activity rhythm coevolve, however, remains to be investigated further as we have found only partial support for the idea that dark irises in birds might be an adaptive feature evolved due to the selective advantage of concealment from undesired visual receptors.

AB  - It has long been believed that the paired circular markings ("eyespots") of Lepidoptera larvae, combined with their defensive postures (where the larvae swell their anterior body segments) protect them from potential predators. These traits could inhibit attacks by enhancing the similarity of the prey item to the predator's own natural enemies (notably snakes), but alternatively, they may simply exploit the predator's wariness of novel and/or conspicuous objects. To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey. In the first experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either without eyespots or with eyespots positioned in 1 of 2 locations on their bodies: anteriorly or centrally. In the second experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either lacking the thickening associated with the defensive posture, or with models in which a thickened section was placed centrally or anteriorly. In both cases, the chicks were significantly more wary of prey with anteriorly positioned defensive traits than either prey without these traits or prey with centrally positioned traits. Because prey with central eyespots and central thickening were equally novel and conspicuousness to those with these traits positioned in a more head-like anterior position, we infer that predator wariness was primarily influenced by the similarity of the prey to their potential natural enemies. These results support the idea that both caterpillar eyespots, and the defensive posture examined here, deter predators not simply because they are conspicuous, but because they enhance caterpillars' resemblance to potentially dangerous vertebrates.Predators are more wary of model caterpillars with eyespots and false heads placed anteriorly than those with these traits placed centrally. Many real caterpillars have anterior segments containing eyespots, which they inflate to create a "false head" when attacked. These traits could intimidate predators because they are conspicuous or because they make caterpillars resemble snakes. Our results support the latter explanation because the position of traits influenced models' resemblance to snakes but not their conspicuousness.

AB  - Symptoms of bacterial canker disease on tomato were first observed in June 1998, in three tomato fields in the semi-mountainous region of Eptagonia (Limassol district). In two of these fields, which were planted with cv. FA 179, infection was almost 100%, with heavy losses. The third field, planted with cv. Graziella, had only sporadic infections. An extensive survey during 1998-99 detected 10 additional cases of bacterial canker, all in the wider agro-ecological zone Of initial disease detection. The pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis was consistently isolated from diseased plants, identified, and its pathogenicity proved. This is the first report of bacterial canker disease on tomato in Cyprus.

AB  - Cyanea is a genus of large bloom-forming scyphozoans, including some of the most conspicuous representatives of megaplankton. Its taxonomy has been revised repeatedly throughout the last century due to the fact that most of the morphological characteristics of Cyanea species, such as color, structure of gastrovascular system and number of tentacles, may overlap greatly in different populations. Here, we report a new species of Cyanea, Cyanea tzetlinii sp. nov., from the White Sea, which is distinguishable from all previously described Cyanea species by an eye-spot-bearing bulb formed at the base of each rhopalium. This well-recognizable morphological characteristic is supported at the molecular level by a substantial genetic distance in mitochondrial (CO1: 9.6-10.6 %, 16S RNA: 3.1-3.5 %) as well as nuclear (ITS: 5.0 %, 18S RNA: 0.1 %) loci, making it the sister species to Cyanea capillata. Taking into account the young geological age of the White Sea and a substantial genetic divergence between C. tzetlinii sp. nov. and the nearest sister species, we suppose that C. tzetlinii sp. nov. has been advected to the White Sea from elsewhere and may also inhabit other Arctic seas. Past ecological studies in the White Sea and possibly in other Arctic Seas could have conflated C. tzetlinii sp. nov. with other species, which likely affected the analyses.

AB  - Over 150 million years, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved. Predatory birds and mammals have eyes on the front of their heads. In these animals, binocular correspondence, voluntary eye movements, eye-hand coordination, partial decussation at the optic chiasm and cortical interhemispheric pathways could develop at the cost of a smaller visual field. The subsequent enlargement of the cerebral neocortex and the hemispheric pathways are of central importance in binocular vision, sensory fusion and infantile strabismus. To investigate visual interhemispheric fibers, tractography was used in subjects with infantile esotropia (IE), callosal agenesis and control subjects with normal binocularity. In human callosal agenesis, normal binocularity could be explained by a different interhemispheric connection. In subjects with infantile esotropia, the analyses starting from the primary visual area on one side appeared different from the analysis from the other side. The distribution areas are asymmetrical between sides. Binocularity and alignment not only rely on correspondence between crossed and uncrossed hemi-representations but, in addition the corpus callosum, the most important interhemispheric pathway in placental mammals, seems important in the development of human binocularity. When correspondence is possible between the hemi-representations of the crossed and the uncrossed pathway on both sides of the cortex, the uncrossed pathway finds its way via the corpus callosum toward the contralateral hemi-representation of the same eye. A vertical midline must come out of this process. Meanwhile, however, the other uncrossed pathway strives to find the vertical midline of the other eye. Likely, the corpus callosum is important during the tuning of the pathways involved in sensory fusion. The anterior commissure might be an alternative in callosal agenesis. A failure in the offset will result in strabismus and crossed dominance after V1. Consequently, the normal binocular development of the brainstem (i.e., the superior colliculus), will not take place and latent nystagmus, as well as dissociated divergence, may ensue.

AB  - Plants release volatiles in response to caterpillar feeding that attract natural enemies of the herbivores, a tri-trophic interaction which has been considered an indirect plant defence against herbivores. The caterpillar-induced plant volatiles have been reported to repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores. To date however, no volatile signals that either repel or attract conspecific adults under field conditions have been chemically identified. Apple seedlings uniquely released seven compounds including acetic acid, acetic anhydride, benzyl alcohol, benzyl nitrile, indole, 2-phenylethanol, and (E)-nerolidol only when infested by larvae of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana. In field tests in New Zealand, a blend of two of these, benzyl nitrile and acetic acid, attracted a large number of conspecific male and female adult moths. In North America, male and female adults of the tortricid, oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, were most attracted to a blend of 2-phenylethanol and acetic acid. Both sexes of the eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana, were highly attracted to a blend of benzyl nitrile and acetic acid. This study provides the first identification of caterpillar-induced plant volatiles that attract conspecific adult herbivores under natural conditions, challenging the expectation of herbivore avoidance of these induced volatiles.

AB  - Coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley & Broome) is the main coffee disease in Brazil. Coffee rust control is calendar-based and performed by applying chemicals in order to avoid the outburst of disease epidemics. The aim of this work was to identify coffee rust using multispectral orbital sensing through analyses utilising vegetation indices and coffee rust incidence, defoliation and yield data obtained in situ. Field samples were georeferenced using a high-accuracy global navigation satellite system receiver in two plots, in a 42-year-old, leaf rust susceptible coffee cultivar. Conventional chemical control of rust was performed in only one of the plots to serve as control. Coffee rust incidence in areas with and without chemical control was assessed over 5 months, from December 2018 to April 2019, a period with optimal environmental conditions for disease occurrence. Following analyses of different vegetation indices and data sampled in the coffee crop, Pearson's correlations between the variables were verified. Reported correlations occurred mainly among coffee rust incidence levels in February 2019 and vegetation indices calculated using Sentinel-2 images from August 2018, September 2018 and February 2019 [IRECI r=0.566; IRECI r=0.493; NDMI r=-0.518; NDVI(RE1) r=-0.562; CI(RE1) r=-0.573; MSR(RE1) r=-0.569], in areas without coffee rust control. Indices based on relationships between bands in the Red-Edge and Near Infra-Red regions were more sensitive to spectral changes in vegetation due to variation in coffee rust occurrence over time.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a warning system platform for coffee rust incidence fifteen days in advance, as well as validating and regionalizing multiple linear regression models based on meteorological variables. The models developed by Pinto were validated in five counties. Experiments were set up in a randomized block design with five treatments and five replications. The experimental plot had six lines with 20 central plants of useful area. Assessments of coffee rust incidence were carried out fortnightly. The data collected from automatic stations were adjusted in new multiple linear regression models (MLRM) for five counties. Meteorological variables were lagged concerning disease assessment dates. After the adjustments, two models were selected and calculated for five counties, later there was an expansion to include ten more counties and 35 properties to validate these models. The result showed that the adjusted models of 15-30 days before rust incidence for Carmo do Rio Claro and Nova Resende counties were promising. These models were the best at forecasting disease 15 days in advance. With these models and the geoinformation systems, the warning platform and interface will be improved in the coffee grower region of the south and savannas of the Minas Gerais State, Brazil.

AB  - The extent to which prey respond to predation risk may depend upon the level of threat it perceives. A prey's perception of a threat can also be influenced by the background levels of predatory threat in the environment. Many animals also rely on visual cues to discriminate threat and assess risk. Eyes, in particular, are known to elicit an aversive response in prey. However, there is a lack of the literature about what salient physical features of a predator's gaze triggers aversion in prey, especially reptilian prey. We capitalized on the putatively aversive effects of eyes to better understand the influence of average background threat on risk perception. We approached blue-tailed skinks (Emoia impar) with four different treatments: a blank control and three experimental treatments (two circular eyes, two squares, and one big circle) to test whether eye shape or number induced a greater aversive response in prey measured by the time allocated to key activities, as well as by flight initiation distance (FID) in locations of high and low background threat. Skinks discriminated more between treatments at low risk than in high risk situations by varying their behavior in response to treatments only in low-risk scenarios, but this did not translate into differences in FID. Our results suggest that in high-risk situations, the cost to discriminate is higher than at low risk. Although we can assume our treatments were not perceived as eyes due to a lack of discrimination toward the two circle treatment, detectability and more specifically diameter of stimuli are the most salient to skinks. While skinks are able to detect subtle differences in visual stimuli, this does not affect their overall fear response. Remarkably, skinks, a species not hunted by humans, have the ability to discriminate subtle features about them, a finding that is seen in other species and requires more study.

AB  - The immature stages of the skipper butterfly Udranomia kikkawai from Brazil are described, including information on host plant use in cerrado savanna, shelter building behavior, and barcode sequences. The caterpillars feed on young leaves of two host food plants, Ouratea spectabilis and Ouratea hexasperma (Ochnaceae). The duration from egg hatching to adult eclosion averaged 30 days. Immature stages of U. kikkawai morphologically resemble those of other Hesperiidae by lacking head horns and complete lack of body scoli, and having a fusiform pupa with uniform color (except for mimetic false eye spots) and no projections. The young -leaf color of Udranomia caterpillars contrasts with that observed in the sister genus Drephalys, whose larvae are conspicuously colored. The food plant of Udranomia is also very uniform: all records are Ochnaceae across the distribution range of Udranomia. Based on molecular data, Brazilian populations correspond to the true U. kikkawai, which is part of a species complex that includes at least two additional undescribed species from Costa Rica. Our paper shows that free access to exchangeable database platforms can raise natural history studies to an integrative level that helps clarify patterns of diversity within taxonomically problematic groups.

AB  - Anthracnose, one of the major diseases in the onion, is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. cepae. The main strategy for controlling this fungus is by the use of fungicide, with this technique being used on the majority of crops. Currently, methods of disease control are being studied that are less aggressive to the environment, with the use of essential oils proving to be an alternative. As such, the aim of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of the essential oils of basil (Ocimum basilicum), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus (DC) Stapf.), sage (Salvia officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and citronella (Cymbopogon winterianus) as an alternative in the control of the fungus C. gloeosporioides f. sp. cepae, in addition to determining its effect on the physiological quality of onion seeds. The essential oils of lemongrass and sage did not affect the physiological quality of the onion seeds, and all the essential oils used helped to inhibit spore germination in C. gloeosporioides f. sp. cepae. The essential oils of thyme, lemongrass and citronella at a concentration of 2000 ppm completely inhibited mycelial growth in the fungus. Treatment with the essential oil of lemongrass in seeds inoculated with the pathogen gave greater protection against fungal attack.

AB  - Previous studies have found that Carolina chickadees and tufted titmice use a predator's head orientation to determine risk, taking fewer seeds from a feeder if an avian predator model's head is facing the feeder while ignoring the head orientation. In addition to head orientation, eyes are a cue of predator risk. In the current study, I examined whether or not chickadees and titmice used the presence of eyes of a predator model to determine when to forage for food. Plastic owl models, with their eyes covered or uncovered, were presented to wild flocks of chickadees and titmice. To test whether or not chickadees and titmice would respond to the presence of eyes, the number of seeds taken and the calling behavior of birds were compared between the two types of predator presentations (eyes covered or uncovered). Chickadees and titmice took fewer seeds when the eyes were uncovered than when they were covered. Chickadees also gave significantly more introductory notes, often used in association with the presence of predators or risk, in their calls when the eyes were visible than when the eyes of the predator model were covered. The results indicate that chickadees and titmice can use the presence of eyes on predators to determine predation risk and possibly use eye gaze to determine where a predator is looking.

AB  - The terms social learning and social influence have been used descriptively and theoretically to characterize a broad range of animal behavior from physical antipredatory adaptations such as eye spots, which are totally under genetic control, to the human capacity for the exaggeration of individual characteristics, known as caricature, which are largely under cognitive control. In the present review, the various forms of social influence and social learning are identified and distinghished from imitation, a term that generally has been reserved for behavioral matching that cannot be accounted for using simpler specifically predisposed, motivational, or learning mechanisms. It is suggested that much of the ambiguity in the literature concerning the various forms of social learning can be attributed to the distinction between the function of a behavior and the mechanisms responsible for its occurrence. Finally, the various mechanisms that have been proposed to account for imitative learning are presented and an attempt is made to evaluate them.

AB  - Circular markings, called eyespots, on the wings of Lepidoptera have been shown to be protective against predators. We tested the 'conspicuousness-hypothesis' and 'eye mimicry-hypothesis' by examining how 'sparkle' and colour pattern of eyespots deter predators. The rationale was to test the deterring effect of shape and colour pattern of the eyespots' elements that are assumed to mimic lens eyes, namely iris, pupil, and sparkle by simultaneous exposure of lepidopteran dummies with equally conspicuous eyespots that differed in their similarity to lens eyes. The results provide evidence that circular and crescent-shaped 'sparkles' were more deterring than rectangular-shaped 'sparkles'. The 'sparkle's' UV-reflection had no effect on the deterrence. Our results support recent findings on the deterrent effect of the eyespot's 'sparkle' and show that colour is less important for deterrence. The characteristic colour pattern of eyespots and illusion of three-dimensionality created by the 'sparkle' might contribute to the deterrent effect.

AB  - A large variety of animals have developed facial likenesses to common vertebrates, presumably serving to deter attack by their predators.  Likenesses run the gamut from unbelievable artistic perfection to ridiculous (to us) caricatures.  These images of mock predators may either remain as a constantly visible deterrent or be flashed when an attack is pressed home and combined with rhythmic display simulating counterattack, and a hissing sound capable of startling the predator long enough to enhance escape possibilities.  The phenomenon of mimicry is strongly linked to that of the intraspecific display, especially as the perceptual system of the animals involved become increasingly complex.  Thus even the displays of such formidable adversaries as the lion, tiger, falcon and cobra may be seen on closer inspection to involve false faces, often supernormal, and presumably have some signalling function as well.  Although mimicry, the evolution of resemblances to other species for protection from predators, has been studied for over a century, the mimicry of faces has not yet received the systematic treatment it seems to deserve.  It has even been the brunt of ridicule by avowed evolutionists and shunned by mimicry researchers themselves.  Logic and reason have been marshalled on an unbelievable scale to discredit what anyone can now see for himself in the photographs.  Most of the cases discussed in this paper have been missed, ignored or dismissed by the experts on either side of the fence.

AB  - This paper presents a database system of the rubber tree leaf diseases which compiled into a Personal Home Page (PHP) script and using Structured Query Language (MySQL). In this work, there are three selected diseases that can be identified using this database system which are Corynespora Leaf Spot, Bird's Eye Spot and Collectrotichum Leaf Disease. Initially, the information of Region of Interest (ROI) from each of these three types of diseases based on Red, Green and Blue (RGB) color model from previous experiments will be taken as the input to the database system. By using PHP, a server-side language which sends Web pages to requesting visitors (you, the client, with your Web browser). When a visitor goes to a website written in PHP, the server reads the PHP code and then processes it according to its scripted directions. The client also able to fill in the data through the system online and the database system output will identify the diseases based on user data input. The purpose of development of this system is to help new users to identify the types of rubber tree leaf diseases whereby it is consists of data collection, stored and kept organized by the Database Management System. Therefore, by using the database system, this may assist the client on identifying the diseases by comparing their records with the available information. While the advantage of this system is it may help new users to study the characteristics of the diseases without referring to the expertise since the information is consists of sample of images and its symptoms.

AB  - Two new marine gastrotrichs of the genus Thaumastoderma are described from South Korea. T. coronarium sp. nov. was collected from the intertidal zones of Manripo beach and Sopori, Tokchok Island in the Yellow Sea. This species seems to be most closely related to T. bifurcatum CLAUSEN, 1991 or T. truncatum CLAUSEN, 1991 in that they share the following characteristics: one pair of simple, spatulate tentacles; six pairs of dorsal cirri; and absence of eye spots. It differs from these species in having four conspicuous head papillae and a different arrangement of dorsal cirri. T. appendiculatum sp. nov. was collected from the intertidal and shallow sublittoral zones of Pongpo beach, Sokcho in the East Sea of Korea, and is easily distinguished from its congeners in having a pair of stout adhesive tubes on the posterior trunk margin, and in that it frequently possesses accessory dorsal cirri. This is the first report on marine gastrotrichs from Korea, and the first record of the genus Thaumastoderma in East Asia.

AB  - In interactions, many tropical stomatopod species display conspicuous colored body spots that can communicate information about the sender's state ( e. g., sex, aggressiveness, etc.). Species inhabiting a variety of depths experience large differences in illumination spectrum and intensity due to filtering of light by water and its constituents. Stomatopod spectral sensitivity is known to vary phenotypically with changes in light environment ( associated with depth) that potentially affects the detection of color signals. Animals collected at different depths also have different body coloration. This study examines how spectral differences in colored body spots vary with organismal condition and models the effects of changing body coloration, light environment, and spectral sensitivity on the detection of color signals in a gonodactyloid species, Gonodactylus smithii. Of the seven conspicuous color spots that were measured in G. smithii, three had spectral differences that correlated with sex, aggression, and female reproductive state. A model of color detection in G. smithii indicates that longer-wavelength spectral content was affected most by varying body coloration and light conditions. Most color signals were perceived similarly both by shallow-and by deep-adapted photoreceptor sets over a range of depths ( 1 - 13 m). Eye spot ('meral spot') color detection also was invariant over the same depth range in shallow- and deep-adapted, long-wavelength receptors, but deep-adapted receptors continued to maintain a consistent detection of these spots down to 18 meters. These results suggest that meral spot coloration may have evolved as a constant signal when viewed by conspecifics from various depths. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Many insects produce sounds when attacked by a predator, yet the functions of these signals are poorly understood. It is debated whether such sounds function as startle, warning or alarm signals, or merely serve to augment other defences. Direct evidence is limited owing to difficulties in disentangling the effects of sounds from other defences that often occur simultaneously in live insects. We conducted an experiment to test whether an insect sound can function as a deimatic (i.e. startle) display. Variations of a whistle of the walnut sphinx caterpillar (Amoiphajuglandis) were presented to a predator, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), when birds activated a sensor while feeding on mealworms (Tenebrio molitor). Birds exposed to whistles played back at natural sound levels exhibited significantly higher startle scores (by flying away, flinching, and hopping) and took longer to return to the feeding dish than during control conditions where no sounds were played. Birds habituated to sounds during a one-hour session, but after two days the startling effects were restored. Our results provide empirical evidence that an insect sound alone can function as a deimatic display against an avian predator. We discuss how whistles might be particularly effective 'acoustic eye spots' on avian predators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecotourism provides an opportunity to experience nature that may promote its conservation. Ecotourists photograph wildlife, and photography plays an important role in focusing public's attention on nature. Although photography is believed to be a low-impact activity, how the visual stimulus of cameras influences wildlife remains unknown. Since animals are known to fear eyes pointed towards them because of similarity to predator eyes, we predicted that cameras with zoom lens would increase vigilance. Using yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and adopting a behavioural approach to identify marmots' response to photography, we experimentally quantified proportion of time allocated to vigilance during foraging and flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which a marmot started to flee from an approaching human) towards humans with and without a camera. We focused on time allocated to vigilance measured in three ways: the proportion of time when marmots moved their head and body towards observers (looking towards observer), the proportion of time when marmots moved their head away from observers (looking away from observer) and the total vigilance (sum of looking towards and away from observer). While a camera was pointed at a marmot, individuals allocated more time to looking towards the observer and less time to looking away from the observer than they did without a camera. However, the total proportion of time allocated to vigilance was not different when marmots were approached by humans with and without a camera. Additionally, whether or not an observer was carrying a camera had no effect on FID. Our results indicated that cameras distracted marmots but did not influence their subsequent risk assessment; marmots may be curious about cameras but were not threatened by them. However, capturing an individual's attention may reduce their ability to look out for predators and thus may increase vulnerability to predation. Regulating photography in locations where predation risk is high or vulnerable species ranges' overlap with humans may be required.

AB  - Peacock spot is also known as olive leaf spot or bird's eye spot and it is caused by a fungus: Spilocaea oleagina. This very common disease occurs throughout olive-growing regions. Cultivars vary in their susceptibility, but all are subject to infection. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the disease may take several years to become serious enough to cause alarm. Leaves fall prematurely. When significant defoliation occurs, strong bloom fails to develop and crop production is substantially reduced. The most favorite formulations employed to fight against this disease are copper based product. However, the negative environmental effects of this heavy metal are quite a big concern leading to the search for new effective and environmentally friendly molecules. In this study, a new fungicide based on tetraconazole, an active principle with systemic action, was tested and compared to dodine and copper oxychloride. The trial was conducted during the years 2010-2012 in an olive grove of southern Italian with a Mediterranean climate. Two fungicide applications were performed each year. For each formulation employed, seven trees were treated. The disease severity on the leaves was affected by the type of fungicide used and the time of its exposure. From the comparison of control plants with the treated ones, the best results were obtained with dodine and copper oxychloride formulations. Overall, tetraconazole reduced the disease and, as a systemic action, may be associated with dodine or copper to control Spilocaea oleagina particularly when the disease is well developed.

AB  - Caterpillar defenses have been researched extensively, and, although most studies focus on visually communicated signals, little is known about the role that sounds play in defense. We report on whistling, a novel form of sound production for caterpillars and rare for insects in general. The North American walnut sphinx (Amorpha juglandis) produces whistle 'trains' ranging from 44 to 2060. ms in duration and comprising one to eight whistles. Sounds were categorized into three types: broadband, pure whistles and multi-harmonic plus broadband, with mean dominant frequencies at 15kHz, 9kHz and 22kHz, respectively. The mechanism of sound production was determined by selectively obstructing abdominal spiracles, monitoring air flow at different spiracles using a laser vibrometer and recording body movements associated with sound production using high-speed video. Contractions of the anterior body segments always accompanied sound production, forcing air through a pair of enlarged spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. We tested the hypothesis that sounds function in defense using simulated attacks with blunt forceps and natural attacks with an avian predator - the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia). In simulated attacks, 94% of caterpillars responded with whistle trains that were frequently accompanied by directed thrashing but no obvious chemical defense. In predator trials, all birds readily attacked the caterpillar, eliciting whistle trains each time. Birds responded to whistling by hesitating, jumping back or diving away from the sound source. We conclude that caterpillar whistles are defensive and propose that they function specifically as acoustic 'eye spots' to startle predators.

AB  - The genus, Pupulanella, Adamski and Nishida, n. gen. is proposed, and synapomorphies are given as supportive evidence. All life stages of P. gemma Adamski and Nishida, n. sp. (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea: Depressariidae) are described, and observations of its natural history are provided. The eggs are saddle-shaped, with several rows of shallow, parallel, and alternating longitudinal ridges and furrows, each contiguous with a transverse crest on opposing polar ends that are steeply sloped. Each egg is laid singly on the underside of leaves along the veins, and occasionally on stems or leaf petioles of the host plant, Rivina humilis L. (Petiveriaceae). The first instar and early second instar live within a weblike silken tunnel on the undersurface of leaves along the leaf veins while later instars construct and live within a partially-rolled shelter along the outer margin the leaf. Pupation occurs within a dried leaf fold in litter on the ground. The pupa is covered with short hairs, is deeply excavated between the labrum and the proximal margins of the maxillae, and possesses a ridgelike structure (= cocoon cutter) on the dorsolateral area of the prothorax. Adult moths exhibit an unusual survival behavior in microlepidoptera, by resting conspicuously on the upper surfaces of leaves exposing a "false head" and eye-spot patterned on the apical part of the forewings, on each side of the posterior end of the insect. Additionally, the terminal portions of the antennae and hindlegs extend well beyond the posterior wing margins contributing to a more realistic headlike mimic. Males and females are crepuscular, exhibiting short distance flights among host plants. Pupulanella brunniceps (Felder and Rogenhofer, 1875), n. comb. is transferred from Filinota..

AB  - At the southern limit of its range the endangered butterfly Coenonympha oedippus inhabits grasslands (wet, dry) that differ significantly in the abundance of its larval hostplants (wet > dry) and mean annual air temperature (wet < dry). We determined the difference in the wing morphology of individuals in the two contrasting habitats to test whether and how traits associated with wing size, shape and eye like spots vary in the sexes and two ecotypes. We show that sexual dimorphism follows the same (wing size and shape, number of eyespots on forewing) or different (relative area of eyespots on hindwings) patterns in the two contrasting habitats. Irrespective of ecotype, females had larger, longer and narrower wings, and more forewing eyespots than males. Sexual dimorphism in the relative area of eyespots on hindwing was female-biased in the wet, but male-biased in the dry ecotype. Ecotype dimorphism in wing size and the relative area of eyespots on the hindwing is best explained by mean annual air temperature and abundance of host-plants. While ecotype dimorphism in wing size did not differ between sexes, neither in direction (wet > dry) or in degree, in the two sexes the relative area of eyespots on hindwing had opposite patterns (males: dry > wet; females: wet > dry) and was more pronounced in males than in females. The differences in wing shape between ecotypes were detected only in the hindwings of males, with more rounded apex in the dry than in the wet ecotype. We discuss the life-history traits, behavioural strategies and selection mechanisms, which largely account for the sex- and ecotype-specific variation in wing morphology.

AB  - During a survey of birds from Argentina, two species of Digenea, one of them new, were found parasitizing the great antshrike, Taraba major (Vieillot) (Ayes: Thamnophilidae). The strigeid, Strigea orbiculata sp. n. is characterized by having a body plump, a copulatory bursa without a membraneous fold ('Ringnapf'), entire testes, eggs with miracidia with eye-spots, by the arrangement of vitelline follicles in the forebody, which are densely distributed from its anterior edge, and by the absence of a neck region in the hindbody. Among the known Neotropical species of Strigea Abildgaard, 1790, only five share with Strigea orbiculata sp. n. the body shape and the distribution of vitelline follicles in the forebody: Strigea caluri Dubois, 1962, S. elliptica (Brandes, 1888), S. inflecta Lunaschi et Drago, 2012, S. nugax Szidat, 1928 and S. sphaerocephala (Westrumb, 1823 nec Brandes 1888). However, S. caluri can be easily distinguished by having a membraneous fold in the copulatory bursa originated from 'Ringnapf', and multilobed testes. Strigea elliptica differs mainly by having a well developed 'Ringnapf' and the remaining species differ principally by metrical characters. The dicrocoeliid, Lyperosomum oswaldoi (Travassos, 1919) is reported for the first time from Argentina and T major represents its new definitive host. The host specificity of Neotropical Strigea spp. is discussed and an updated list of records of their hosts is provided.

AB  - Adult life spans of insects are part of supposedly adaptive life-history syndromes, which involve a variety of reproductive strategies with regard to mating, egg maturation and egg laying. Contingencies of life span with many other morphological, behavioural, and ecological traits are to be expected. We used a data-mining approach, incorporating controls for phylogeny, to uncover broad patterns of trait contingencies in a literature-derived data set of adult life spans for 350 butterfly species. We found that adult feeding habit has strong links with life spans, with pollen-feeders living longer than fruit feeders, which in turn live longer than nectar feeders. Furthermore, traits reducing susceptibility to predators (i.e. aposematism, eye-spots) are associated with longer life. Mud-puddling behaviour as a means of gaining access to minerals, and possibly nitrogen, was generally associated with a short life. We also found strong impacts of the region of occurrence of species (i.e. whether they were tropical or temperate taxa), but received conflicting results depending on whether we analysed field data (longer life in the tropics) or data from caged individuals (shorter life in the tropics). Adult longevity was associated with the growth form of larval host plants (higher on lianas as opposed to herbs, shrubs, or trees), whereas other larval host plant traits did not have strong links with species' life spans. We discuss the hypothetical evolutionary mechanisms explaining those patterns and suggest predictions that could be tested in further research.

AB  - Animals often respond to attacks from predators with behaviors directed at the predator that increase the probability of escape. Some animals also respond to attacks with behaviors that release signals or cues that are detected by conspecifics and enhance escape. Cephalopods, with their complex nervous systems, produce many behaviors, one of which is ejecting ink when attacked by predators. Ink is thought to enhance the ability of the inking cephalopod to escape from the predator, which is a reasonable idea but is lacking experimental support and description of mechanisms. Inking might also serve as an alarm cue, evoking alarm responses in conspecifics. The aim of our study was to determine if ink of the Caribbean reef squid, Sepioteuthis sepioidea, is a conspecific alarm cue. We studied freely behaving animals in the laboratory to determine if they produced alarm or escape behavior in response to ink. We observed that squid responded to conspecific ink introduced into their aquarium with deimatic behaviors containing chromatophore elements ('eye spots', 'all brown', and 'flashing'), cryptic behaviors with chromatophore elements ('clear', 'plaid', 'dark arms'), cryptic behaviors with postural responses ('sargassum', 'bad hair'), and protean behavior (Tin movement', 'inking', jetting'). Squid also responded to ink introduced into an adjacent aquarium within view, thus demonstrating that vision can contribute to the alarm response. Melanin-free ink did not evoke a significant alarm response. This is the first experimental demonstration that squid respond to ink of conspecifics as a visual alarm cue. Ink may also provide a chemical alarm cue for S. sepioidea, though further behavioral studies are needed to explore this. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND The loss of coffee leaves caused by the attack of pests and diseases significantly reduces its production and bean quality. Thus this study aimed to estimate foliation for regions with the highest production of arabica coffee in Brazil using nonlinear models as a function of climate. A 25-year historical series (1995-2019) of Coffea arabica foliation (%) data was obtained by the Procafe Foundation in cultivations with no phytosanitary treatment. The climate data were obtained on a daily scale by NASA/POWER platform with a temporal resolution of 33 years (1987-2019) and a spatial resolution of approximately 106 km, thus allowing the calculation of the reference evapotranspiration (PET). Foliation estimation models were adjusted through regression analysis using four-parameter sigmoidal logistic models. The analysis of the foliation trend of coffee plantations was carried out from degrees-day for 70 locations. RESULTS The general model calibrated to estimate the arabica coffee foliation was accurate (mean absolute percentage error = 2.19%) and precise (R-adj(2) = 0.99) and can be used to assist decision-making by coffee growers. The model had a sigmoidal trend of reduction, with parameters y(max) = 97.63%, y(min) = 9%, X-o = 3517.41 DD, and p = 6.27%, showing that foliation could reach 0.009% if the necessary phytosanitary controls are not carried out. CONCLUSION Locations with high air temperatures over the year had low arabica coffee foliation, as shown by the correlation of -0.94. Therefore, coffee foliation can be estimated using degree days with accuracy and precision through the air temperature. This represents great convenience because crop foliation can be obtained using only a thermometer. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Seed transmission, overwinter survival, and dispersal of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis on processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and spread of C. m. michiganensis on alternative hosts and nonhost plants were evaluated with rifampicin-resistant strains of C. m. michiganensis (Rif+ C. m. michiganensis) and a selective medium. The bacterium was transmitted at a low rate from seed to transplants by sowing infested seed in the greenhouse and transplanting the seedlings to a production field. Populations of Rif+ C. m. michiganensis detected on seed harvested from systemically infected plants ranged from about 10(2) to 10(5) cfu/g seed. Survival of Rif+ C. m. michiganensis associated with infested tomato debris was greater for debris on the soil surface than for debris that was buried. Populations of Rif+ C. m. michiganensis declined at about the same rate in samples buried 10, 20, and 30 cm. Populations of Rif+ C. m. michiganensis on alternative hosts and nonhost plants fluctuated from 0 to about 10(9) cfu/g fresh weight on solanaceous plants (Capsicum annuum, Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum, Nicotiana tabacum, Solanum melongena, S. nigrum, and S. tuberosum) and from 0 to about 10(3) cfu/g fresh weight on nonsolanaceous weeds (Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, and Xanthium saccharatum). Leaf surface populations of Rif+ C. m. michiganensis on nonhost solanaceous plants and nonsolanaceous plants were significantly lower than on tomatoes. Symptoms of secondary infection were not observed on plants of these species. Susceptible (Heinz 1810) and moderately resistant (Heinz 7417) tomato cultivars supported leaf surface populations of about 10(7) to 10(9) cfu/g fresh weight. Symptoms of secondary infection, marginal scorch of leaflets or bird's-eye spots of fruit, were not observed on tomatoes until populations exceeded 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/g fresh weight for the moderately resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. Symptoms of systemic infection were not observed in either cultivar when Rif+ C. m. michiganensis spread from foci of infection, but symptoms of secondary infection occurred earlier and were more severe on the susceptible cultivar.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots on butterfly wings have been shown to deter predators. This has been traditionally explained by mimicry of vertebrate eyes, but recently the classic eye-mimicry hypothesis has been challenged. It is proposed that the conspicuousness of the eyespot, not mimicry, is what causes aversion due to sensory biases, neophobia or sensory overloads. We conducted an experiment to directly test whether the eye-mimicry or the conspicuousness hypothesis better explain eyespot efficacy. We used great tits (Parus major) as model predator, and tested their reaction towards animated images on a computer display. Birds were tested against images of butterflies without eyespots, with natural-looking eyespots, and manipulated spots with the same contrast but reduced resemblance to an eye, as well as images of predators (owls) with and without eyes. We found that mimetic eyespots were as effective as true eyes of owls and more efficient in eliciting an aversive response than modified, less mimetic but equally contrasting eyespots. We conclude that the eye-mimicry hypothesis explains our results better than the conspicuousness hypothesis and is thus likely to be an important mechanism behind the evolution of butterfly eyespots.

AB  - We describe the final instars of two tropical Sphingidae caterpillars-Eumorpha phorbas and Eumorpha labruscae-from Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica, whose anal horn has become a posterior eyespot structure capable of rapid palpitation. When approached or harassed, the caterpillars palpitate this eyespot and produce the effect of a blinking vertebrate eye. We propose that this blinking is an extension of eye mimicry or at least draws attention to the eyespot, functioning to startle or intimidate would-be predators. As snakes lack eyelids and do not blink, this suggests that the blinking eye represents a more generalized (or possibly mammalian) eye. Eyespot blinking is probably controlled by the same musculature used to wave the anal horn in earlier instars. The extent to which this eyespot is perceived as a blinking eye, and the degree of protection from the caterpillars' suite of potential predators, remain to be discovered.

AB  - Mining is present in all major biomes worldwide and overlaps strongly with areas of importance for bird conservation. Mining causes multiple types of environmental disturbance, including habitat alteration, increased human presence and persistent heavy metal pollution. Feather coloration and fluctuating asymmetry (random deviation from perfect symmetry between the two sides of the body), especially of elaborate or ornamental characters, have been proposed as potentially useful biomarkers of anthropogenic stress in birds. However, there has been virtually no research on their responses to mining disturbance. Here, we use colour and morphometric measurements and collection location data from museum specimens of the Russet-crowned Motmot Momotus mexicanus to evaluate how their proximity to mining concessions in south-central Mexico (Morelos, Guerrero and Oaxaca states) relates to: (1) structural and melanin-based plumage coloration, and (2) size and fluctuating asymmetry of their distinctive racket-shaped tail. As a resident, philopatric bird that has been observed nesting directly in contaminated mining waste, motmots may be particularly well suited for addressing this question. In birds collected closer to metal mines, the violet under-eye spot had decreased UV-blue chroma and the black eye streak was paler, and there was weaker colour contrast between these adjacent conspicuous facial plumage patches. Body, tail and crown colour and tail length and asymmetry were unaffected by metal mine distance, and no variable was affected by distance to mines extracting non-metals. Overall, our findings show that aspects of motmot coloration are affected by mining disturbance, probably more from heavy metal contamination rather than other aspects of mine-related anthropization. Further research is needed to determine whether these effects are due to direct toxicity or to ecological effects such as decreased food availability and to discern whether altered colour of conspicuous patches affects social processes such as mate choice and territorial interactions in populations exposed to mining.

AB  - Disease and pest alert models are able to generate information for agrochemical applications only when needed, reducing costs and environmental impacts. With machine learning algorithms, it is possible to develop models to be used in disease and pest warning systems as a function of the weather in order to improve the efficiency of chemical control of pests of the coffee tree. Thus, we correlated the infection rates with the weather variables and also calibrated and tested machine learning algorithms to predict the incidence of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee borer. We used weather and field data obtained from coffee plantations in production in the southern regions of the State of Minas Gerais (SOMG) and from the region of the Cerrado Mineiro; these crops did not receive phytosanitary treatments. The algorithms calibrated and tested for prediction were (a) Multiple linear regression (RLM); (b) K Neighbors Regressor (KNN); (c) Random Forest Regressor (RFT), and (d) Artificial Neural Networks (MLP). As dependent variables, we considered the monthly rates of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee tree borer, and the weather elements were considered as independent (predictor) variables. Pearson correlation analyses were performed considering three different time periods, 1-10 d (from 1 to 10 days before the incidence evaluation), 11-20 d, and 21-30 d, and used to evaluate the unit correlations between the weather variables and infection rates of coffee diseases and pests. The models were calibrated in years of high and low yields, because the biannual variation of harvest yield of coffee beans influences the severity of the diseases. The models were compared by the Willmott's 'd', RMSE (root mean square error), and coefficient of determination (R-2) indices. The result of the more accurate algorithm was specialized for the SOMG and Cerrado Mineiro regions using the kriging method. The weather variables that showed significant correlations with coffee rust disease were maximum air temperature, number of days with relative humidity above 80%, and relative humidity. RFT was more accurate in the prediction of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee borer using weather conditions. In the SOMG, RFT showed a greater accuracy in the predictions for the Cerrado Mineiro in years of high and low yields and for all diseases. In SOMG, the RMSE values ranged from 0.227 to 0.853 for high-yield and 0.147 and 0.827 for low-yield coffee in the coffee borer forecasting.

AB  - Many species of lepidoptera bear conspicuous circular patterns on their wings, known as eyespots, that are hypothesised to protect their bearers against predatory birds. In this study, we focus on a small but ubiquitous feature occurring naturally in lepidopteran eyespots, namely the so-called sparkle. The pupil in an eyespot is often highlighted by a sparkle, which is hypothesised to mimic a natural corneal total light reflection evident as a highlight, twinkle, or sparkle in the vertebrate eye. In a study exploring the presence of such sparkles, we found that 53% of lepidopteran eyespots exceeding 1 mm in diameter have a central, pinpoint-like sparkle, 12% have a marginal, crescent-shaped sparkle, 13% have a semi-circular sparkle, and 22% have an intermediate semi-circular to crescent-shaped sparkle. In the lepidopterans natural resting position, the marginal sparkles are positioned in the upper part of the eyespotspupil and thus may create the illusion of a spherical eyeball. The sparkles in lepidopteran eyespots do not only appear white to humans, but also reflect ultraviolet light. White and UV-reflecting sparkles also appear white for UV-sensitive viewers such as birds, and thus may effectively mimic the natural highlight in vertebrate eyes as an area of total light reflection. In field experiments using lepidopteran dummies baited with a mealworm, we show that the sparkle is one of several components of eyespots eliciting a deterrent effect and that eyespots with a sparkle in a natural position have a stronger deterrent effect than those with a sparkle in an unnatural position. These findings support the eye mimicry hypothesis that better vertebrate eye mimicry improves the deterrent effect of eyespots.

AB  - Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals.

AB  - Many prey species possess eyespots: paired markings that often consist of two or more concentric circles. Predators are wary of such prey because eyespots are conspicuous and/or mistaken for vertebrate eyes. Here we used naive domestic chicks as predators of artificial moth-like prey to test the hypothesis that both eyespots configuration and predator approach direction affect the antipredator efficacy of eyespots. We found that when chicks approached prey straight on, eyespots configuration did not influence attack latency. Chicks that approached from either the left or the right, were slower to attack prey in which the central circle of the eyespot was centrally placed or shifted in the direction of the chick's approach, compared to prey in which the central circle had been shifted away from the direction of approach. These findings suggest that eyespots composed of concentric circles may protect prey against predators approaching from a wider range of directions than eyespots composed of eccentric circles. They are also consistent with the idea that eyespots are mistaken for eyes, and are perceived to pose a lesser risk when their "gaze" is averted from the approaching predator.

AB  - Predation experiments have shown that the large eyespots (concentric rings of contrasting colors) found on the wings of several lepidopteran species intimidate passerine predators. According to the eye mimicry hypotheses, the intimidation is caused by predators associating the eyespots with the presence (of the eyes) of their own enemy. The conspicuousness hypothesis suggests, instead, that it is simply the conspicuousness of eyespot patterns that is intimidating, possibly due to a sensory bias. We studied how the number of eyespots, 2 or 4, influences intimidation. We predicted that if eye mimicry is important, the maximum response would be reached with a pair of eyespots. On the other hand, if conspicuousness is important, then more than 2 eyespots should result in an even stronger response. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, has 4 large eyespots on its wings. We presented naive insectivorous birds (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca) 2 different prey items made from wings of dead peacock butterflies and a mealworm between the wings. One group of birds received prey that had no or only 2 eyespots visible and the other group received prey that had no or all 4 eyespots visible. Eyespots clearly increased hesitation before attacks. Because the birds were naive, this difference in response to the eyespots was innate. Importantly, there was no difference in attack latency between 2 and 4 eyespots. We conclude that it is unlikely that conspicuousness as such has selected for eyespots in the peacock butterfly.

AB  - Alike the little mouse of the Gruffalo's tale, many harmless preys use intimidating deceptive signals as anti-predator strategies. For example, several caterpillars display eyespots and face-like colour patterns that are thought to mimic the face of snakes as deterrents to insectivorous birds. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the hypothesis that these defensive strategies exploit adaptive cognitive biases of birds, which make them much more likely to confound caterpillars with snakes than vice versa. By focusing on the information-processing mechanisms of decision-making, the model assumes that, during prey assessment, the bird accumulates noisy evidence supporting either the snake-escape or the caterpillar-attack motor responses, which compete against each other for execution. Competition terminates when the evidence for either one of the responses reaches a critical threshold. This model predicts a strong asymmetry and a strong negative correlation between the prey- and the predator-decision thresholds, which increase with the increasing risk of snake predation and assessment uncertainty. The threshold asymmetry causes an asymmetric distribution of false-negative and false-positive errors in the snake-caterpillar decision plane, which makes birds much more likely to be deceived by the intimidating signals of snake-mimicking caterpillars than by the alluring signals of caterpillar-mimicking snakes.

AB  - Aposematic prey advertise their defence to visually hunting predators using conspicuous warning colouration. Established theory predicts that aposematic signals should evolve towards increased conspicuousness and similarity to enhance predator education. Contrary to theoretical expectations, there is often considerable within- and between-species variation in aposematic signals of animals sharing the same ecological niche, phylogeny and predators. This may be explained by varying responses of predators that weaken the selection pressure for a consistent signal. By presenting painted mealworm larvae as prey to great tits as predators we tested if different aposematic colour patterns have different values as a means of initial protection and learnt avoidance from predators, and how widely birds generalise their learnt avoidance to other colour patterns. We also investigated how the colour and luminance of the pattern elements affect predator attack decisions. Finally, we studied if hunger affects the predators' reaction to differently coloured prey. We found that similarity in colour was not crucial to the survival of aposematic prey, since learnt avoidance was not influenced by colour, and predators remembered and generalised widely in their learnt avoidance to other colours. We found that initial avoidance was, however, apparently influenced by luminance contrast. Interestingly, the predators' level of hunger was more important than the colour of the aposematic signal in determining birds' decisions to attack chemically-defended insect larvae. We discuss the implications of visual properties of prey colour pattern and predator appetite for the evolution of insect defences and warning signals. In addition we propose a methodological approach to effectively control for predator appetite in laboratory experiments.

AB  - The hypothesis of satyric mimicry postulates that the colour patterns of an animal may make its identity ambiguous, and this ambiguity interferes with the process of perception in vertebrate predators for a sufficient time to allow the potential prey to take evasive action. It has now been found that eyespots and other designs on the wings of many insect species are often coupled with other wing patterns and designs. These composite images often closely resemble heads and bodies of vertebrates (including birds and reptiles) and of various invertebrates. Such images can be perceived in living insects, although only rarely in set specimens because of displacement of the components. Visual processing by non-mammalian vertebrates generally involves attention to detail, suggesting that, at least initially, and unlike humans, they perceive embedded images on insect wings and bodies and ignore the whole or Gestalt. They are therefore likely to be confused by the ambiguity of the potential prey. It can be calculated that a delay of the order of only tenths of a second in the attack on a stationary insect by a predator could result in failure of capture. It is proposed in the present review that the concept of satyric mimicry be extended to include complex imagery of other organisms. Such iconic images, which often represent toxic or dangerous animals, are particularly common amongst saturniid moths and nymphalid and danaid butterflies (including the Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus).(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 203214.

AB  - Numerous butterflies have circular patterns called eyespots on their wings. Explanations for their functional value have until recently remained hypothetical. However, several studies in the last few years have supported long-standing hypotheses, and the current paper reviews these recent advances. Large and conspicuous eyespots are thought to be effective by being intimidating to predators and thus reducing predation. This hypothesis has received strong support in different studies. It has been shown that eyespots are intimidating because of their conspicuousness, but experimental support for the idea that eyespots are effective by mimicking vertebrate eyes is at the moment lacking. Studies have also tested the deflection hypothesis, where smaller marginal eyespots are thought to deflect attacks away from the body of the prey, increasing chances of survival with a torn wing. Despite previous negative results, recent work has shown that eyespots can indeed deflect attacks toward themselves under specific conditions. Furthermore, data show that dorsal eyespots are used by males and females as signals during courtship. How the diversity in ventral eyespot patterning has evolved remains a mystery. Future directions and further challenges in understanding the adaptive value of eyespots are discussed.

AB  - Morphological and behavioural traits can serve as anti-predator defence either by reducing detection or recognition risks, or by thwarting initiated attacks. The latter defence is secondary and often involves a 'startle display' comprising a sudden release of signals targeting more than one sensory modality. A suggested candidate for employing a multimodal defence is the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, which, by wing-flicking suddenly, produces sonic and ultrasonic sounds and displays four large eyespots when attacked. The eyespots make small birds retreat, but whether the sounds produced thwart predator attacks is largely unknown. Peacocks hibernate as adults in dark wintering sites and employ their secondary defence upon encounter with small rodent predators during this period. In this study, we staged predator-prey encounters in complete darkness in the laboratory between wild mice, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus, and peacocks which had their sound production intact or disabled. Results show that mice were more likely to flee from sound-producing butterflies than from butterflies which had their sound production disabled. Our study presents experimental evidence that the peacock butterfly truly employs a multimodal defence with different traits targeting different predator groups; the eyespots target birds and the sound production targets small rodent predators.

AB  - Tadpoles of five anuran species were tested for preferences in the use of the eyes during inspection of their own visual image in a mirror. When tested in a tank with several small mirrors, tadpoles of five different species (Bufo bufo, Bufo viridis, Rana temporaria, Rana esculenta, Bombina variegata) preferentially approached and positioned themselves with the mirror located on their left side, thus looking at the image with the monocular field of their left eye. Similar results were obtained with tadpoles of R. temporaria tested in a simple task in which they had to choose approaching one or other of two large mirrors located on their left and right side. Control experiment showed that the behavioural asymmetry was not due to motor preferences and that it was independent of morphological asymmetries in the positions of the spiracles. This is the first demonstration of a functional visual lateralisation among juvenile amphibia before metamorphosis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the oldest fossil crustaceans are those of the Late Cambrian (Furongian 2199 +/- 0.3-488.3 +/- 1.7 Ma) of Vastergotland, central Sweden and the lower Ordovician (Tremadocian 488.3 and 478.6 Ma) of the island of Oland. These are three-dimensionally preserved in nodules from the so called 'stinkstone' ('Orsten') limestone. 'Orsten'-like fossils represent tiny, often meiobenthic organsisms (Haug, Maas, & Waloszek, 2009) smaller than 2 mm, which mainly were arthropods, especially crustaceans close to the stemline. As a result of phosphatisation, hairs, bristles and even cellular structures up to 0.3 mu m are preserved (Walossek; 1993), especially compound eyes, as typical for all visually orientated crustaceans (Schoenemann et al., 2011). We show a miniscule prototype of a compound eye (similar to 40 mu m) in a small crustacean, which lived almost half a billion years ago. The eye is close to but comfortably established above being limited in its resolving power by diffraction, but it is too small to be an apposition eye, normally regarded as the basal form of all compound eyes, as is found in bees, dragonflies, crustaceans and many other arthropods still living today. The facets of this compound eye are similar to 8 mu m in size, the surface structure indicates the relicts of a tiny lens covering each facet. In order to work functionally and to ensure that that diffraction and waveguide problems were avoided, it seems reasonable to suppose that the compound eye consisted of visual units, each with a single photoreceptor cell directly below a weak lens for capturing and slightly focusing the light. The entire unit has a diameter similar to that of a normal sensory cell as found in compound eyes. Thus, the early compound eye analysed here may be interpreted as a prototype representing the earliest stages of the evolution of crustacean compound eyes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the effects of predator-prey distance (PPD) and trajectory of the predator on the body patterns that the pharaoh cuttlefish, Sepia pharaonis, shows in response to a predator. A model predator moving in three different trajectories was presented to the cuttlefish: T1, approached the cuttlefish but bypassed above; T2, approached directly toward the cuttlefish; T3, bypassed the cuttlefish both vertically and horizontally. We divided the body patterns that the cuttlefish expressed into seven categories, i.e., "uniform light", "disruptive", "center circle", "dark square", "vertical stripe", "all dark"and "eyespots". In T1, the number of individuals that showed "dark square"increased as the model approached the cuttlefish, whereas the number of individuals that showed "disruptive" decreased. In T2, the number of individuals that showed "all dark"and "eyespots"increased as the model approached the cuttlefish. In T3, the number of individuals that showed "dark square" and "vertical stripe"increased as the model approached the cuttlefish, and it tended to decrease as the model receded from the cuttlefish. These results demonstrate that S. pharaonis changes its body patterns according to PPD and the trajectory of the predator, which would affect predation risk and/or predator perception.

AB  - Insects that hibernate as adults have a life span of almost a whole year. Hence, they must have extraordinary adaptations for adult survival. In this paper, we study winter survival in two butterflies that hibernate as adults and have multimodal anti-predator defences-the peacock, Inachisio, which has intimidating eyespots that are effective against bird predation, and the small tortoiseshell, Aglais urticae, which does not have an effective secondary defence against birds. We assessed predation on wild butterflies hibernating in the attic of an unheated house, as well as survival of individually marked butterflies placed by hand on different sites in the attic. Our objectives were to assess (1) the number of butterflies that were killed during hibernation, (2) whether survival differed between butterfly species, and (3) how predation was related to hibernation site and the identity of the predator. There was a strong pulse of predation during the first 2 weeks of hibernation: 58% of A. urticae and 53% of I. io were killed during this period. Thereafter, predation decreased and butterfly survival equalled 98% during the final 16 weeks of hibernation. There was no difference in survival between the two butterfly species, but predation was site-specific and more pronounced under light conditions in locations accessible to a climbing rodent, such as the common yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis. We contend that small rodents are likely important predators on over-wintering butterflies, both because rodents are active throughout winter when butterflies are torpid and because they occur at similar sites.

AB  - In this work, a modified Leslie-Gower-type predator-prey model is analyzed, considering now that the prey population is affected by a weak Allee effect, complementing results obtained in previous papers in which the consequences of strong Allee effect for the same model were established.
   In order to simplify the calculations, a diffeomorphism is constructed to obtain a topological equivalent system for which we establish the boundedness of solutions, the nature of equilibrium points, the existence of a separatrix curve dividing the behavior of trajectories. Also, the existence of two concentric limit cycles surrounding a unique positive equilibrium point (generalized Hopf or Bautin bifurcation) is shown.
   Although the equilibrium point associated to the weak Allee effect lies in the second quadrant, the model has a rich dynamics due to this phenomenon, such as it happens when a strong Allee effect is considered in prey population.
   The model here analyzed has some similar behaviors with the model considering strong Allee effect, having both two limit cycles; nevertheless, they differ in the amount of positive equilibrium points and the existence in our model of a non-infinitesimal limit cycle, which exists when the positive equilibrium is a repeller node. The main results obtained are reinforced by means of some numerical simulations.

AB  - In the ecological literature, many models for the predator-prey interactions have been well formulated but partially analyzed. Assuming this analysis to be true and complete, some authors use that results to study a more complex relationship among species (food webs). Others employ more sophisticated mathematical tools for the analysis, without further questioning. The aim of this paper is to extend, complement and enhance the results established in an earlier article referred to a modified Leslie-Gower model. In that work, the authors proved only the boundedness of solutions, the existence of an attracting set, and the global stability of a single equilibrium point at the interior of the first quadrant. In this paper, new results for the same model are proven, establishing conditions in the parameter space for which up two positive equilibria exist. Assuming there exists a unique positive equilibrium point, we have proved, the existence of: i) a separatrix curve Sigma, dividing the trajectories in the phase plane, which can have different omega - limit, ii) a subset of the parameter space in which two concentric limit cycles exist, the innermost unstable and the outermost stable. Then, there exists the phenomenon of tri-stability, because simultaneously, it has: a local stable positive equilibrium point, a stable limit cycle, and an attractor equilibrium point over the vertical axis. Therefore, we warn the model studied have more rich and interesting properties that those shown that earlier papers. Numerical simulations and a bifurcation diagram are given to endorse the analytical results.

AB  - In this paper we consider the multiparameter system introduced in [9], which corresponds to an extension of the classic minimal Daphnia-algae model. It is shown that there is a neighborhood in the parameter space where the system in the realistic quadrant has a unique equilibrium point which is a repelling weak focus of order four enclosed by a global attractor hyperbolic limit cycle. For a small enough change of the parameters in this neighborhood, bifurcation occurs from the weak focus four infinitesimal Hopf limit cycles (alternating the type of stability) such that the last bifurcated limit cycle is an attractor. Moreover, for certain values of parameters, we concluded that this applied model has five concentric limit cycles, three of them being stable hyperbolic limit cycles. This gives a positive answer to a question raised in [2, 4].

AB  - Animals utilise various strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including camouflage, warning colours and mimicry, and many of these protective signals promote avoidance behaviour in predators. For example, various species possess paired circular 'eyespots', which startle or intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. However, little is known of how the efficacy of such signals relates to the context in which they are found, and no studies have tested the relative effectiveness of anti-predator signals when on otherwise camouflaged and conspicuous prey. We find that the protective value of conspicuous wing spots, placed on artificial moth-like targets presented to wild birds in the field, is strongly affected by the attributes of the prey 'animal' on which they are found. Wing spots reduced predation when on conspicuous prey but were rendered ineffective when on otherwise camouflaged targets, indeed they increased the risk of predation compared to non-marked camouflaged controls. These results demonstrate how different anti-predator strategies may interact, and that protective signals can switch from being beneficial to costly under different contexts.

AB  - Circular patterns, or eyespots, are common anti-predator features in a variety of animals. Two defensive functions have been documented: large eyespots may intimidate predators, whereas smaller marginal eyespots may divert attacks. However, a given eyespot potentially serves both functions, possibly depending on the predator's size and/or experience. Naive predators are potentially more likely to misdirect their attacks towards eyespots; alternatively, their typically smaller size would make them more intimidated by the same eyespots. Here we test how juvenile and sub-adult naive chickens respond to a single eyespot on a butterfly's wing. We presented the birds with dead wall brown butterflies, Lasiommata megera, that had their apical eyespot visible or painted over. We assessed the birds' responses' by (i) scoring their intimidation reaction, (ii) whether they uttered alarm calls and, (iii) if they attacked the butterfly and where they targeted their attacks. Results show that both age categories received higher intimidation scores when offered a butterfly with a visible eyespot. Juveniles were more intimidated by the butterfly than the sub-adults: they received higher intimidation scores and were more prone to utter alarm calls. Moreover, only sub-adults attacked and did so by preferentially attacking the butterfly's anterior. We demonstrate an intimidating effect of the type of eyespot that has previously been shown only to divert attacks. We suggest that one and the same eyespot may serve two functions relative to different predators; however, further experiments are needed to disentangle the role of predator identity and its link to size, ontogeny and experience

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots have evolved in multiple taxa and presumably function to thwart predator attacks. Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to Amply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Mathis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted oven Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator.

AB  - Organisms frequently gain advantages when they engage in signalling with individuals of other species. Here, we provide a functionally structured framework of the great variety of interspecific visual signals seen in nature, and then describe the different signalling mechanisms that have evolved in response to each of these functional requirements. We propose that interspecific visual signalling can be divided into six major functional categories: anti-predator, food acquisition, anti-parasite, host acquisition, reproductive and agonistic signalling, with each function enabled by several distinct mechanisms. We support our classification by reviewing the ecological and behavioural drivers of interspecific signalling in animals and plants, principally focusing on comparative studies that address large-scale patterns of diversity. Collating diverse examples of interspecific signalling into an organized set of functional and mechanistic categories places anachronistic behavioural and morphological labels in fresh context, clarifies terminology and redirects research effort towards understanding environmental influences driving interspecific signalling in nature.

AB  - The signalling role of asymmetry has attracted considerable recent interest among evolutionary biologists. Although it has been studied primarily within the context of sexual selection, symmetry of signals may play a role also in inter-specific communication, such as predator-prey interactions. Both theory and experimental evidence suggest that asymmetry may impair the efficacy of visual warning signals used to deter potential predators, but increase the protective value of non-signalling, cryptic colour patterns used to decrease the risk of detection. Here we tested the prediction from this hypothesis by means of intra-individual comparisons of asymmetry in colour pattern elements in three species of moths (Arctia caja (L.), Noctua orbona (L.), Smerinthus ocellata (L.)) that possess cryptic fore wing patterns and signalling hind wing patterns. Mean asymmetries constituted 4.3% (range 2.1-7.0%) of trait size for colour pattern elements, whereas individual asymmetry levels reached as high as 26%. Asymmetry tended to be somewhat larger in cryptic patterns on fore wings than in signalling patterns on hind wings in five of six comparisons, but in only one case was the difference statistically significant. In addition, pattern elements were somewhat more asymmetric on fore wings also in Saturnia pavonia (L.), which possesses identical signalling eyespots on both fore and hind wings. The relatively low levels of asymmetry also in cryptic patterns imply either that selection does not favour increased asymmetry in cryptic patterns, or that the evolution of pronounced asymmetry is developmentally or genetically constrained.

AB  - Long-lived butterflies that hibernate as adults are expected to have well-developed antipredation devices as a result of their long exposure to natural enemies. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, for instance, is a cryptic leaf mimic when resting, but shifts to active defence when disturbed, performing a repeated sequence of movements exposing major eyespots on the wings accompanied by a hissing noise. We studied the effect of visual and auditory defence by staging experiments in which wild-caught blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were presented with one of six kinds of experimentally manipulated living peacock butterflies as follows: butterflies with eyespots painted over and their controls (painted on another part of the wing), butterflies with their sound production aborted (small part of wings removed) and their controls, and butterflies with eyespots painted over and sound production aborted and their controls. The results showed that eyespots alone, or in combination with sound, constituted an effective defence; only I out of 34 butterflies with intact eyespots was killed, whereas 13 out of 20 butterflies without eyespots were killed. The killed peacocks were eaten, indicating that they are not distasteful. Hence, intimidation by bluffing can be an efficient means of defence for an edible prey.

AB  - Anurans show a wide variety of anti-predator mechanisms, and the species of the Neotropical clade Leiuperinae display several of them. Most species of Edalorhina, Physalaemus and Pleurodema show eyespots, hidden bright colours, macroglands in a inguinal/lumbar position, defensive behaviours and/or chemical defence. We conducted a histological analysis of dorsal and lumbar skin and revised the colour patterns, defensive behaviours and glandular secretions to study the diversity and evolution of anti-predator mechanisms associated with macroglands. We describe 17 characters and optimize these in a phylogenetic hypothesis of Leiuperinae. In the most recent common ancestor of Edalorhina + Engystomops + Physalaemus + Pleurodema, a particular type of serous gland (the main component of macroglands) evolved in the lumbar skin, along with the absence of the Eberth-Katschenko layer. A defensive behaviour observed in leiuperines with macroglands includes four displays ('crouching down' behaviour, rear elevation, body inflation and eye protection), all present in the same ancestor. The two elements associated with aposematism (hidden bright colours and eyespots) evolved independently in several species. Our results provide phylogenetic evidence for the startle-first hypothesis, which suggests that behavioural displays arise as sudden movements in camouflaged individuals to avoid predatory attacks, before the origin of bright coloration.

AB  - When constraints on antipredator coloration shift over the course of development, it can be advantageous for animals to adopt different color strategies for each life stage. Many caterpillars in the genus Papilio exhibit unique ontogenetic color sequences: for example, early instars that masquerade as bird feces, with later instars possessing eyespots. I hypothesize that larvae abandon feces masquerade in favor of eyespots due to ontogenetic changes in signaler size. This ontogenetic pattern also occurs within broader seasonal shifts in background color and predator activity. I conducted predation experiments with artificial prey to determine how potential signaling constraints (specifically size and season) shape predation risk, and consequently the expression of ontogenetic color change in Papilio larvae. Seasonally, both predation and background greenness declined significantly from July to September, though there was little evidence that these patterns impacted the effectiveness of either color strategy. Caterpillar size and color strongly affected the attack rate of avian predators: attacks increased with prey size regardless of color, and eyespotted prey were attacked more than masquerading prey overall. These results may reflect a key size-mediated tradeoff between conspicuousness and intimidation in eyespotted prey, and raise questions about how interwoven aspects of behavior and signal environment might maintain the prevalence of large, eyespotted larvae in nature.

AB  - The present study evaluated the relative effects of abiotic (weather: temperature, wind speed, and rain) and biotic (intra- and intertrophic density dependence: densities of conspecifics, prey per predator individual and leaves on plants) factors on the dispersal and on-plant activity (foraging and oviposition),of the predatory bug, Orius minutus, under seminatural field conditions. Experiments were conducted at plots, each comprising 25 potted azuki bean plants, placed symmetrically. in concentric circles, in 1998 and 1999. At the central pot within each plot, 5 marked females of O. minutus (witha male in 1998) were released, and their location and activity Were recorded hourly up to 24 h. A total of 78 individuals were released. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to select among weather, density dependence, and time variables. Hourly dispersal probability of individuals was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with-time since release and with prey density per individual O. minutus. Hourly probability of individuals being active was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with number of leaves of visited plants and conspecific density per leaf. Between-year difference was observed in the probability of individuals being active, which was higher in 1998 than in 1 99, probably generated by hunger and higher age. By contrast, diffusion rate was estimated to be lower in 1998, suggesting a trade-off between foraging/oviposition and dispersal by flight. The results indicate that dispersal is affected by temperature and intra-/intertrophic-level density dependence within and between trophic levels, as are foraging/oviposition. The importance of incorporating both abiotic and biotic factors should be stressed when modeling predator-prey metapopulation dynamics on a greenhouse scale.

AB  - Butterfly wing ocelli (spots) are argued to have adaptive functions (anti-predator, mate enhancement). However, little attention has been given to differences between individual spots, sexes and populations. Hipparchia semele is a lateral basker, rarely opening its wings when settled other than during courtship. This provides a potential for uncoupling the functions of ventral and dorsal ocelli. Data from 725 specimens belonging to 12 North Wales populations are used to examine the consistency in wing spots in relationship to wing expanse, sexes and biotopes. Given that predators tend to prefer heavier, larger and slower prey, spot size should increase at a faster rate than wing expanse and should be larger in females. Spot size should also reflect sex differences in behaviour, resource use and vulnerability to predators, in addition to sexual selection. Given that females expose the dorsal wings during courtship, the forewing dorsal wing spots should be larger than the forewing ventral wing spots, and the forewing anal spot should act as a more prominent signal than the apical spot compared with males. These observations are supported by this study. The results are discussed in relationship to strategies (crypsis and active defence) to combat predation and for sexual selection.

AB  - In general, butterfly ventral hind wing eyespots are considered to play a role in predator-prey interactions. These eyespots are prominent wing pattern elements in Brassolini butterflies, and they vary in size, position, and number across taxa. Female Caligo Hubner, 1819 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) appear to use the large eyespots of lekking males as a mate-locating cue, but female Opsiphanes Doubleday, 1849 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) do not because males patrol to find mates. These behaviors led us to predict that male Caligo should have larger eyespots than females, but eyespot size would not differ between sexes in Opsiphanes. Our analyses supported these predictions. As displacement of the eyespots to the center of the wing might make them more conspicuous, we asked if eyespot position and size covaried across the Brassolini phylogeny. While we found a positive association between position and size, the relationship of these two variables contained significant phylogenetic signal. Two Brassolini species show strong sexual dimorphism where females converge on the color pattern of sympatric species of Caligo. Their ventral hind wing eyespots are much larger than those of close relatives, approximating those of Caligo, and further reinforcing the importance of ventral hind wing eyespots as a visual signal in this group of butterflies. Importantly, our results suggest that, in addition to antipredation defense, ventral hind wing eyespots can function in mating activities, and consequently they might be evolving under both natural and sexual selection in Caligo butterflies.

AB  - 1. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle Dendroctonus micans is a major pest of spruce which is expanding its range in France, Turkey, England and Wales. Its monospecific predator Rhizophagus grandis has followed its prey naturally into most areas and since the 1960s has also been mass-produced and released within newly infested locations. Assessing bark-beetle presence at previously uninfested sites, or predator establishment after release or natural spread, currently depends on direct observation of D. micans brood chambers. This is a slow and unreliable process because bark-beetle attacks are solitary, cryptic and occur on living trees. An effective trapping method would thus be most useful.
   2. A synthetic lure for R. grandis was first field-tested in release-recapture experiments. Release points were surrounded by one or two concentric rings of traps baited with either D. micans larval frass or with a blend of synthetic chemicals. Kairomone-trapping using the synthetic lure was then tested in the field, monitoring R. grandis in 58 spruce stands in Belgium and France.
   3. In the release-recapture experiments, up to 65% of the released predators were caught within 48 h. Catches with the synthetic lure and with prey frass were not significantly different.
   4. Field-trapping assays showed R. grandis establishment in 30 stands, including areas where the predator had been introduced artificially. Trapping was unsuccessful at the southern and western limits of D. micans' range. Combined visual and trapping approaches identified 32 stands containing the predators, with two false negatives with the trapping method, compared to 19 for the visual surveys.
   5. Unexpectedly, male and female D. micans adults were trapped in some cases. The combined approach identified 43 attacked stands, among which there were four false negatives with the trapping method and 11 with the visual surveys.
   6. Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of using kairomone traps to monitor a predator after releases for biocontrol. Furthermore, because this predator is strictly prey-specific, this technique also identifies stands colonized by D. micans bark beetles. Following inoculative predator releases, kairomone trapping could be used to survey for D. micans in areas under colonization or in European Union 'Protected Zones'.

AB  - Large eyespots on the wings of butterflies and moths have been ascribed generally intimidating qualities by creating a frightening image of a bird or mammal much larger than the insect bearing the eyespots. However, evidence for this anti-predator adaptation has been largely anecdotal and only recently were peacock butterflies, Inachis io, shown to effectively thwart attacks from blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Here, we test whether large eyespots on lepidopterans are generally effective in preventing attacks from small passerines and whether the size of insect or bird can influence the outcome of interactions. We staged experiments between the larger eyed hawkmoths, Smerinthus ocellatus, and the smaller peacock butterflies, I. io, and the larger great tits, Parus major, and the smaller blue tits, P. caeruleus. Survival differed substantially between the insect species with 21 of 24 peacock butterflies, but only 6 of 27 eyed hawkmoths, surviving attacks from the birds. Thus, surprisingly, the smaller prey survived to a higher extent, suggesting that factors other than insect size may be important. However, great tits were less easily intimidated by the insects' eyespots and deimatic behaviour and consumed 16 of 26, but the blue tits only 8 of 25, of the butterflies and hawkmoths. Our results demonstrate that eyespots per se do not guarantee survival and that these two insects bearing equally large eyespots are not equally well protected against predation.

AB  - Although numerous studies about camouflage have been conducted in the last few decades, there is still a significant gap in our knowledge about the magnitude of protective value of different camouflage strategies in prey detection and survival. Furthermore, the functional significance of several camouflage strategies remains controversial. Here we carried out a comprehensive meta-analysis including comparisons of different camouflage strategies as well as predator and prey types, considering two response variables: mean predator search time (ST) (63 studies) and predator attack rate (AR) of camouflaged prey (28 studies). Overall, camouflage increased the predator ST by 62.56% and decreased the AR of prey by 27.34%. Masquerade was the camouflage strategy that most increased predator ST (295.43%). Background matching and disruptive coloration did not differ from each other. Motion camouflage did not increase ST but decreases AR on prey. We found no evidence that eyespot increases ST and decreases AR by predators. The different types of predators did not differ from each other, but caterpillars were the type of prey that most influenced the magnitude of camouflage's effect. We highlight the potential evolutionary mechanisms that led camouflage to be a highly effective anti-predatory adaptation, as well as potential discrepancies or redundancies among strategies, predator and prey types.

AB  - Small eyespots on butterflies have long been thought to deflect attacks, and birds are the presumptive drivers selecting for these patterns; however, evidence of this function is still ambiguous. Marginal eyespots typically consist of a UV-reflective white pupil, surrounded by one black and one yellowish ring. We have recently shown that Cyanistes caeruleus (blue tits) attack such eyespots, but only under low light intensities with accentuated UV levels: the increased salience of the eyespots relative to the rest of the butterfly probably explains this result. Possibly the background against which the butterfly is concealed may deceive birds to make similar errors. We therefore presented speckled wood butterflies decorated with eyespots (or controls without eyespots) to C.caeruleus against two backgrounds: oak and birch bark. Our results show that: (1) eyespots, independent of background, were effective in deflecting attacks; (2) the time elapsed between a bird landing and the attack was interactively dependent on the background and whether the butterfly bore an eyespot; and (3) the speed at which a butterfly was attacked predicted the outcome, with faster birds being more prone to errors than slower birds. This underscores a speedaccuracy trade-off in the predators, and that background plays a role in the defensive qualities of marginal eyespots.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 290297.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the expansion parameters of four different new-generation balloon-expandable stents in a curved stenotic phantom model.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five stents for each length and type, each with a 3.5-mm diameter (AVE, 12 mm and 18 mm; Penta, 13 mm and 18 mm; BX-Sonic, 13 mm and 18 mm; and Jostent Flex Master, 12 mm and 16 mm), were implanted in curved silicon models 3.25 mm in diameter with 58% concentric elastic stenoses. The forces exerted on the inner curvature were continuously registered. Minimal luminal diameter (MLD) and reference luminal diameter (RLD) of the stents, inflated balloon diameter at both ends of the stents during inflation (BDref), and balloon diameter at the stenotic site during inflation (BD-in) Were determined by magnification radiography.
   RESULTS: The Penta and AVE stents presented greater RLD (Penta, 3.78 mm +/- 0.08; AVE, 3.75 mm +/- 0.13; BX-Sonic, 3.47 mm +/- 0.06; Jostent, 3.28 mm +/- 0.06) and MLD values (Penta, 2.94 mm +/- 0.18; AVE, 3.05 mm +/- 0.19; BX-Sonic, 2.68 mm +/- 0.06; Jostent, 2.53 mm +/- 0.09) than the BX-Sonic and Jostent stents. Displacement forces after stent placement were greater for AVE (0.034 N +/- 0.015) and Penta stents (0.023 N +/- 0.017) than for BX-Sonic (0.013 N +/- 0.007) and Jostent stents (0.009 N +/- 0.007; P < .05). BDmin was correlated in a linear fashion with MLD (r = 0.84; P < .001), as was BDref with RLD (r = 0.92; P < .001), for all stents.
   CONCLUSIONS: Inflated balloon diameter was the main determinant of stent expansion. The AVE and Penta stents gained larger MLD values than the BX-Sonic and Jostent stents, but they excessively dilated the nonstenotic region of the model.

AB  - Training at a specific movement tempo is a relatively new concept in resistance training. It is based on manipulation of the duration of particular phases of a movement. General studies have demonstrated that faster movement tempo in resistance training leads to an increase in muscle power, whereas lower movement speed is beneficial in the development of muscle strength and hypertrophy. However, the studies in this area are inconclusive and do not relate precisely to various tempos and movement speeds. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of duration of the eccentric cadence ECCREG (2/0/X/0) and ECCSLO (6/0/X/0) on muscular power generated in the concentric phase of the movement expressed in maximal P-MAX, V-MAX and average values P-AVE, V-AVE. For the ECCSLO (6/0/X/0) cadence, a significantly lower value of P (401.95 +/- 65.42 W) was observed compared to the ECCREG 2/0/X/0 tempo (467.65 +/- 79.18 W), at p = 0.007. The same was true for power evaluated in maximal values (P-MAX), as significantly higher values were recorded for the regular ECCREG (2/0/X/0) (671.55 +/- 115.79 W) compared to the slow tempo ECCSLO (6/0/X/0) (565,70 +/- 117,37 W), at the level of significance of p = 0.007. The velocity evaluated for ECCREG (2/0/X/0) tempo expressed in average values (V-AVE) 0.60 +/- 0.09 m/s was significantly higher compared to the ECCSLO (6/0/X/0) tempo (0.52 +/- 0.08 m/s), with p=0.004. When maximal velocity (V-MAX), was considered higher values for ECCREG (2/0/X/0) tempo was registered (0.79 +/- 0.10 m/s) compared to the ECCSLO (6/0/X/0) tempo (0.69 +/- 0.13 m/s), at significance of p = 0.001. The main finding of the study indicates that the duration of the eccentric phase of the movement has a significant impact on muscular power and velocity during the concentric phase of the movement.

AB  - The purpose of tins study was to investigate the stability of kinematics responses related to stretch shortening cycle (SSC) during 10 consecutive soccer instep kicks The kicking motions of dominant legs were captured from five experienced adult male soccer players (body height 184 60 +/- 4 49 cm, body mass 80 +/- 4 24 kg, age 25 60 +/- 1 14 years) using a three-dimensional infra-red high speed camera at 200 Hz Sonic important kinematic parameters include eccentric angular velocity (AVe), concentric angular velocity (AVc), duration of eccentric (Te), and duration of concentric (Tc) at forward and impact phases selected to analyses The AVe result of the sixth kick, relative to the first kick, was significantly lower when compared to the other kicks (with p <= 0 001.) The AVc result of the fifth kick, relative to the first kick, was significantly lower when compared to the other kicks (with p <= 0 001) The Te result of the fourth kick, relative to the first kick, was significantly lower when compared to the other kicks (with p <= 0 011) The Tc result of the Nth kick, relative to the first kick, was significantly lower when compared to the other kicks (p <= 0 029) We concluded that 5 consecutive kicks arc adequate to achieve high kinematic responses related to SSC

AB  - A general solution to the antiplane problem of two concentric circular-ave inclusions in bonded dissimilar materials is provided. Based upon the Hilbert problem formulation and the technique of analytical continuation the expressions of the complex potentials are derived explicitly in both the unit disk and the surrounding medium. Both the stress singularity coefficients and contact stress are provided in an explicit form and the former are verified by comparison with the existing ones. The effects of material and geometrical parameters upon the contact stress and stress singularity coefficients are examined and shown in graphic form. Failure initiation of an infinite bi-material plate with two are inclusions is also discussed.

AB  - The life cycle of Australapatemon magnacetabulum Dubois, 1988 was resolved experimentally. Planorbid snails Biomphalaria tenagophila (d'Orbigny, 1835) collected in a small pond at the confluence of the San Lorenzo and Arias Rivers, near Salta City, Province of Salta, Argentina, were found to be shedding furcocercous cercariae possessing 4 pairs of penetration glands, 1 pair of unpigmented eyespots, 6 pairs of flame cells in the body, and 1 pair in the tail stem. Metacercariae were found encysted in naturally, and experimentally, exposed leeches Helobdella adiastola Ringuelet, 1972, Helobdella triserialis (Blanchard, 1849), Haementeria eichhorniae Ringuelet 1978, and Haementeria sp., and within their sporocysts in naturally infected planorbid intermediate hosts. Sexually mature adults were recovered from domestic chicks and a duck 8-28 days postexposure by metacercariae from leeches. The identification of the species was based upon the characteristic large ventral sucker and a genital cone, crossed by a hermaphroditic duct with internal folds, occupying approximately a 1/4 to 1/5 of the hindbody.

AB  - Numerical solutions were obtained for the field of velocity in angular forced flow through the annulus between two concentric cylinders of large and infinite aspect ratio with a gap-to-inner radius ratio of 0.05 using a finite-element representation and the FIDAP code. For an infinite aspect ratio, velocity vectors reveal a purely angular motion below a critical Dean number of 37.31 and a secondary motion in the form of pairs of counterrotating vortices above that value. The wavelength of these vortices and the friction factor ave correlated in terms of the Dean number. For large but finite aspect ratios a weak secondary motion around the periphery is found to occur below the critical Dean number, while for greater values the vortex at each end of the channel is greatly extended. The computed patterns of flow are in good agreement with prior experimental visualizations as well as with those carried out as part of this investigation, The computed characteristics are also in good agreement with prior theoretical results for limiting cases. The adaptation of the results for flow through an Archimedean spiral is described.

AB  - Many lepidopteran caterpillars appear to gain protection from insect-eating birds because they possess eyespots, a pair of conspicuous markings on the body generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator. Similarly, many caterpillars widen their anterior body segments when threatened, and this defensive posture may also deter attack because it emphasizes the caterpillar's eyes and/or allows the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely. Yet, given that this behaviour is not limited to caterpillars with eyespots, it is possible that the defensive posture may serve as a predator deterrent in itself. To disentangle the protective value of eyespots and widened anterior body segments, we created four types of artificial caterpillar in a 2x2 factorial design and deployed them on tree branches in the field where they were exposed to predation attempts by wild birds. The 'survivorship' of the artificial caterpillars was monitored over 90 h in six locations. We found a clear survival advantage for artificial prey with eyespots or a widened head shape. However, prey possessing both eyespots and a widened head did not survive longer than prey with either characteristic alone, suggesting that the traits did not act synergistically to deter attack. Interestingly though, only caterpillars in the eyespot-defensive posture treatment received more pecks directed towards the anterior 'head' region. Collectively, this study demonstrates clearly that caterpillars possessing either eyespots or widened anterior body segments are likely to experience reduced predation by wild birds, even at northern latitudes where there are relatively few arboreal snakes.

AB  - The Reynolds equation is extended to include the effects of radial deflection in a seal with two flexibly mounted rotors. The resulting pressures are used to obtain the forces and moments introduced in the axial and angular modes by the inclusion of eccentricity in the analysis. The rotor dynamic coefficients: relating the forces and moments in these modes to the axial and angular deflection are shown to be the same as those presented in the literature for the concentric case. Additional coefficients ave obtained to express the dependence of these forces and moments upon the radial deflections and velocities. The axial force is shown to be decoupled from both the angular and radial modes, bur the angular and radial modes are coupled to one another by the dependence of the tilting moments upon the radial deflections. The shear stresses acting upon the element faces are derived and used to obtain the radial forces acting upon the rotors. These forces are used to obtain rotor dynamic coefficients for the two radial degrees of freedom of each rotor. The additional rotor dynamic coefficients call be used to obtain the additional equations of motion necessary to include the radial degrees of freedom in the dynamic analysis. These coefficients introduce additional coupling between the angular and radial degrees of freedom, but the axial degrees of freedom remain decoupled.

AB  - Specimens of a species of cyclocoelid digenean inhabiting Jacana spinosa from the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica, most closely resemble Haematotrephus facioi (Brenes and Arroyo, 1962) Yamaguti, 1971, in the same host from Aranjuez. Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, in having confluent vitelline follicles posteriorly, diagnostic of Neohaematotrophus, and in pharynx length, ovary width, and cirrus sac on the sinistral side. The new species is also highly similar in appearance to H. gendrei Dubois, 1959, also inhabiting a jacanid (from West Africa), which has vitelline follicles confluent posteriorly, and extending anteriorly to the intestinal bifurcation and genital pore opening immediately posterior to the anterior margin of the pharynx. Like H. facioi, H. gendrei has a relatively much shorter and broader cirrus sac than does the new species. Examination of the holotype and paratype of H. facioi confirmed that the specimens from Guanacaste differ in having a longer body, a larger ovary and eggs, and smaller testes. They also have the ovary on the sinistral rather than the dextral side of the body, genital pore anterior to the pharynx rather than at or posterior to the level of the posterior margin of the pharynx, longer and thinner cirrus sac, and eggs without eyespotted miracidia. Half the eggs in both specimens of H. facioi have well-developed eyespotted miracidia, whereas the typical condition for cyclocoelids is for virtually all eggs to exhibit eyespotted miracidia. Both H. facioi and H. gendrei are transferred to Neohaematotrophus, along with the new species.

AB  - Predation is a ubiquitous and strong selective pressure on living organisms. Transparency is a predation defence widespread in water but rare on land. Some Lepidoptera display transparent patches combined with already cryptic opaque patches. A recent study showed that transparency reduced detectability of aposematic prey with conspicuous patches. However, whether transparency has any effect at reducing detectability of already cryptic prey is still unknown. We conducted field predation experiments with free avian predators where we monitored and compared survival of a fully opaque grey artificial form (cryptic), a form including transparent windows and a wingless artificial butterfly body. Survival of the transparent forms was similar to that of wingless bodies and higher than that of fully opaque forms, suggesting a reduction of detectability conferred by transparency. This is the first evidence that transparency decreases detectability in cryptic terrestrial prey. Future studies should explore the organization of transparent and opaque patches in animals and their interplay on survival, as well as the costs and other potential benefits associated with transparency on land.

AB  - Prey use many strategies to avoid being detected by their predators. However, once detected and identified as potentially palatable, prey must employ a second line of defence such as performing a deimatic (startle) display. During the predation sequence, composed of the stages encounter, detection, identification, approach, subjugation and consumption, such defences should be deployed as the predator approaches, but before prey are brought under the predator's control (i.e. before subjugation). We tested this assumption in the mountain katydid (or bush cricket), which is cryptic at rest, but when disturbed flashes spectacular abdominal colours by lifting its wings, and is chemically defended. We experimentally determined which visual, auditory and tactile stimuli trigger their deimatic display via six treatments. Contrary to expectations of the predation sequence katydids required tactile cues before performing their deimatic display, that is, it was performed only after attempted subjugation. Field experiments also showed that katydids perform their deimatic display after experiencing tactile stimuli. Mountain katydid natural history may explain this counterintuitive behaviour. Being slow and cryptic, katydids cannot effect a fast escape after performing their deimatic display but their tough cuticle and chemical defences make survival of initial subjugation attempts likely. Holding their deimatic display until after initial subjugation may prevent continued attack and avoid the potentially large cost of revealing themselves to predators that have not yet noticed them. Performance of deimatic display after subjugation may be more common than currently recognized and we encourage further investigation. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Many prey use multicomponent deceptive signals to fool predators into mistaking them for inedible objects, toxic prey, or dangerous animals. However, recent experiments have suggested that multicomponent deceptive signals are no more effective in deterring predators than single-component signals, making it difficult to understand how they have evolved. Here, we use an established experimental system in which naive domestic chicks are presented with models of snake-mimicking caterpillars to test the idea that multicomponent deceptive signals reduce the speed at which predators learn that prey are profitable. We presented chicks with a series of 4 trials in which they encountered a single type of caterpillar model. The type of model differed among our 4 experimental groups that were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design: models either possessed eyespots or did not and were in either the resting or defensive posture. Chicks' responses to the same model prey were then retested following an extended 72-h retention period. Chicks rapidly attacked prey with no defensive traits and initially showed similar levels of wariness to prey with either 1 or 2 deceptive traits. However, chicks learned that single-trait caterpillars were profitable more quickly than 2-trait caterpillars and retained their learned responses better. This suggests that prey with multicomponent deceptive signals may have a selective advantage over prey with single-component deceptive signals when predators repeatedly encounter such prey.

AB  - Junonia evarete Cramer is a fast-flying butterfly that perches on the ground with wings opened exhibiting four eyespots close to wing borders. These eyespots presumably function either to intimidate predators, like insectivorous birds, or to deflect bird attacks to less vital parts of the body. We assessed the form, frequency, and location of beak marks on the wings of wild butterflies in central Brazil during two not consecutive years. We found that almost 50% of males and 80% of females bore signals of predator attacks (wing tears), most of them consisting of partially or totally V-shaped forms apparently produced by birds. Males were significantly less attacked and showed a lower proportion of attacks on eyespots than females, suggesting they are better to escape bird attacks. In contrast, females were heavily attacked on eyespots. Eyespot tears in females were higher (and significant different) than expected by chance, indicating that birds do attempt to reach the eyespots when striking on these butterflies. Other comparisons involving the proportion of tears directed or not directed to eyespots in males and females are presented and discussed.

AB  - Eyespots are conspicuous circular features found on the wings of several lepidopteran insects. Two prominent hypotheses have been put forth explaining their function in an antipredatory role. The deflection hypothesis posits that eyespots enhance survival in direct physical encounters with predators by deflecting attacks away from vital parts of the body, whereas the intimidation hypothesis posits that eyespots are advantageous by scaring away a potential predator before an attack. In the light of these two hypotheses, we investigated the evolution of eyespot size and its interaction with position and number within a phylogenetic context in a group of butterflies belonging to the genus Junonia. We found that larger eyespots tend to be found individually, rather than in serial dispositions. Larger size and conspicuousness make intimidating eyespots more effective, and thus, we suggest that our results support an intimidation function in some species of Junonia with solitary eyespots. Our results also show that smaller eyespots in Junonia are located closer to the wing margin, thus supporting predictions of the deflection hypothesis. The interplay between size, position, and arrangement of eyespots in relation to antipredation and possibly sexual selection, promises to be an interesting field of research in the future. Similarly, further comparative work on the evolution of absolute eyespot size in natural populations of other butterfly groups is needed.

AB  - 1. Aposematic coloration in prey promotes its survival by conspicuously advertising unpalatability to predators. Although classical examples of aposematic signals involve constant presentation of a signal at a distance, some animals suddenly display warning colours only when they are attacked.
   2. Characteristics of body parts suddenly displayed, such as conspicuous coloration or eyespot pattern, may increase the survival of the prey by startling the predator, and/or by signalling unpalatability to the predators at the moment of attack.
   3. The adaptive value of such colour patterns suddenly displayed by unpalatable prey has not been studied. We experimentally blackened the red patch in the conspicuous red-white-black hindwing pattern displayed by an unpalatable insect Lycorma delicatula White (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) in response to predator's attack.
   4. There was no evidence that the presence of the red patch increased prey survival over several weeks. We hypothesise that predators generalised from the red-white-black patches on the hindwings of unpalatable L. delicatula to any similar wing display as a signal of unpalatability. Because a higher proportion of males than females stay put at their resting sites, displaying their wings in response to repeated attacks by predators, wing damage was more frequent in males than in females.
   5. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test of an adaptive role of aposematic signals presented by unpalatable prey during sudden displays triggered by direct predatory attack.

AB  - Documentation of predator attacks in nature is important for understanding how specific antipredator defences have evolved, but previous accounts have been mostly anecdotal. Therefore, we monitored predation on two closely related butterfly species, Aglais urticae and Inachis io, during winter hibernation. Butterflies were placed singly close to the floor on walls in dark, seminatural hibernation sites (e. g. unheated outhouses). We used motion-initiated infrared-sensitive cameras to record predator attacks on the butterflies. The antipredator attributes of the two species have two characteristics: during rest the butterflies reduce predators' attention by mimicking leaves but they can suddenly change their guise by repeatedly flicking their wings. The wing flicking also produces hissing sounds and ultrasonic clicks and, furthermore, I. io, but not A. urticae, have large eyespots on the dorsal wing surface. The two butterfly species suffer from mouse predation during the winter and mice have been suggested as potential targets for the butterflies' sound production. Results showed that (1) mice (Apodemus spp.) were important predators on butterflies, (2) I. io often survived attacks by wing-flicking behaviour, and (3) both species moved to less accessible positions after interactions with mice and other small mammalian predators, but I. io more often so. The successful predator evasion in darkness by I. io suggests a multimodal defence; in addition to the large eyespots, which intimidate birds, we suggest that the hissing and/or click sounds produced during wing flicking may have evolved as defence against rodent attacks.

AB  - Background: Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions-in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head.
   Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities.

AB  - Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless.

AB  - Various conspicuous signals in nature promote initial and learned avoidance by predators. It is widely thought that such signals are most effective when highly symmetrical in features such as size and shape, supported by recent laboratory experiments with domestic chicks and artificial prey. However, no study has investigated the effect of asymmetry on conspicuous signals in a natural setting, where viewing distances, angles, predator species, and light conditions vary and where predators encounter prey sequentially rather than simultaneously. We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field. Experiment 1 had treatments with symmetrical spots or with spots asymmetrical in area between 5 and 50%. All marked treatments survived better than unmarked controls, but there was no benefit of being symmetrical. Experiment 2 tested the effect of possessing markings asymmetrical for shape or position and any additive effect of these 2 features. Again, symmetry conferred no benefit and targets with markings asymmetrical for position and/or shape survived equally well as those with symmetrical arrangements. These findings indicate that asymmetry in warning signals may not be costly to prey in nature or be of less importance compared with other features of the signal, such as color and overall size.

AB  - Butterflies that hibernate exhibit particularly efficient defence against predation. A first line of defence is crypsis, and most hibernating butterflies are leaf mimics. When discovered, some species have a second line of defence; the peacock, I. io, when attacked by a predator flicks its wings open exposing large eyespots and performs an intimidating threat display. Here we test the hypothesis that butterflies relying solely on leaf mimicking and butterflies with an intimidating wing pattern, when attacked, exhibit different behavioural suites-because leaf mimicking is best implemented by immobility, whereas intimidating coloration is best implemented by intimidating behaviour. In laboratory experiments blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were allowed 40 min to attack single individuals of three species of butterfly: one relying solely on crypsis, the comma, Polygonia c-album; one relying on intimidating wing pattern in addition to crypsis, the peacock; and one intermediate species, the small tortoiseshell Aglais urticae. The results are in accordance with expectations and demonstrate that: (1) birds take longer to discover the leaf mimicking species, the comma, than the tortoiseshell and the peacock; (2) the comma remained motionless throughout experimental trials but small tortoiseshells and peacocks flicked their wings when attacked; (3) the most intimidating butterfly, the peacock, started flicking its wings at a greater distance from the attacking bird than the small tortoiseshell; and (4) the intimidating pattern and behaviour of peacocks was effective-when discovered, all peacocks survived interactions with blue tits, whereas only 22% of commas and 8% of small tortoiseshells survived.

AB  - Sixteen peacocks Inachis io (L.) and one red admiral Vanessa atalanta (L.) were killed by hornets Vespa crabro during a four day observation period in August 2002 on butterflies feeding on fermenting plums. Four successful attacks on peacocks were directly observed, and were invariably preceded by the butterfly opening its wings when attacked. When feeding, peacocks usually kept their wings closed and only flicked their wings open to prevent another approaching insect from alighting on the plum. Wing-flicking behaviour by peacocks is effective when thwarting attacks from birds, but was fatal when practised against hornets. A hypothesis for the evolution of intimidating eyespots on buttertly wings is advanced, suggesting that it is preceded by, and associated with, wing-flicking behaviour which in turn is associated with fruit- or sap-feeding.

AB  - Many butterfly species feature two or four conspicuously coloured eyespots on their wings; the most commonly heard explanation for these markings is that they are used to intimidate predators. However, this explanation has stood, until recently, on the flimsiest of empirical foundations. Now, Adrian Vallin and colleagues have demonstrated empirically the effectiveness of these signals in dissuading avian predators from attacking the bearers. Their work suggests that predators can be intimidated by bold displaying by otherwise defenceless prey, and opens up an interesting challenge to evolutionary ecologists to explain how this apparently maladaptive behaviour is retained in predator populations.

AB  - Surface structures that trap light leading to near complete structural absorption creates an appearance of "super black.'' Well known in the natural world from bird feathers and butterfly scales, super black has evolved independently from various anatomical structures. Due to an exceptional ability to reduce specular reflection, these biological materials have garnered interest from optical industries. Here we describe the false eyes of the eyed elater click beetle, which, while not classified as super black, still attains near complete absorption of light partly due to an array of vertically-aligned microtubules. These cone-shaped microtubules are modified hairs (setae) that are localized to eyespots on the dorsum of the beetle, and absorb 96.1% of incident light (at a 24.8 degrees collection angle) in the spectrum between 300-700 nm. Filled with melanin, the setae combine structure and pigment to generate multiple reflections and refractions causing light to travel a greater distance. This light-capturing architecture leaves little light available to receivers and the false eyes appear as deep black making them appear more conspicuous to predators.

AB  - Colour pattern has served as an important phenotype in understanding the process of natural selection, particularly in brightly coloured and variable species like butterflies. However, different selective forces operate on aspects of colour pattern, for example by favouring warning colours in eyespots or alternatively favoring investment in thermoregulatory properties of melanin. Additionally, genetic drift influences colour phenotypes, especially in populations undergoing population size change. Here, we investigated the relative roles of genetic drift and ecological selection in generating the phenotypic diversity of the butterfly Parnassius clodius. Genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism data show that P. clodius forms three population clusters, which experienced a period of population expansion following the last glacial maximum and have since remained relatively stable in size. After correcting for relatedness, morphological variation is best explained by climatic predictor variables, suggesting ecological selection generates trait variability. Solar radiation and precipitation are both negatively correlated with increasing total melanin in both sexes, supporting a thermoregulatory function of melanin. Similarly, wing size traits are significantly larger in warmer habitats for both sexes, supporting a Converse Bergmann Rule pattern. Bright red coloration is negatively correlated with temperature seasonality and solar radiation in males, and weakly associated with insectivorous avian predators in univariate models, providing mixed evidence that selection is linked to warning coloration and predator avoidance. Together, these results suggest that elements of butterfly wing phenotypes respond independently to different sources of selection and that thermoregulation is an important driver of phenotypic differentiation in Parnassian butterflies.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots are known to function in predator deflection and predator intimidation, but it is still unclear what factors cause eyespots to serve one function over the other. Both functions have been demonstrated in different species that varied in eyespot size, eyespot number and wing size, leaving the contribution of each of these factors to butterfly survival unclear. Here, we study how each of these factors contributes to eyespot function by using paper butterfly models, where each factor is varied in turn, and exposing these models to predation in the field. We find that the presence of multiple, small eyespots results in high predation, whereas single large eyespots (larger than 6mm in diameter) results in low predation. These data indicate that single large eyespots intimidate predators, whereas multiple small eyespots produce a conspicuous, but non-intimidating signal to predators. We propose that eyespots may gain an intimidation function by increasing in size. Our measurements of eyespot size in 255 nymphalid butterfly species show that large eyespots are relatively rare and occur predominantly on ventral wing surfaces. By mapping eyespot size on the phylogeny of the family Nymphalidae, we show that these large eyespots, with a potential intimidation function, are dispersed throughout multiple nymphalid lineages, indicating that phylogeny is not a strong predictor of eyespot size.

AB  - Masquerade describes a defence by animals that have evolved to closely resemble inedible objects such as twigs, stones or bird droppings. Animals that masquerade often match their models in size or shape, and may even adopt specific postures in order to enhance their resemblance, causing predators to misclassify them as their model objects. The caterpillars of some moth species resemble bird droppings, and bend their bodies while resting on branches or leaves. We hypothesized that such bending might enhance the caterpillars' resemblance to real bird droppings. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by pinning artificial caterpillars with green or bird dropping coloration onto tree branches in both straight and bent postures, after which we exposed them to bird predation in the wild. We found that the adoption of a bent posture resulted in a lower attack rate by birds on the artificial caterpillars with the bird dropping coloration, while green caterpillars experienced no benefit from the same treatment. This study is the first experimental demonstration of the protective value of a specific posture in masquerading prey, and highlights the importance of considering an organism's shape and posture in the study of masquerade.

AB  - The "deflection hypothesis" asserts that conspicuous marginal patches on insect wings function to deflect predator attacks toward such patches and away from more vital body parts. As a result of selection from predator attacks, these marks are predicted to increase the probability of escape by tearing relatively easily. To test if a conspicuous marginal patch is weak relative to a homologous wing area without such a patch, hindwing tear weight was compared among three Pierella species (Satyrinae) differing in the presence of a conspicuous patch in the hindwing tornus. The species with a conspicuous white hindwing patch (P astyoche) had significantly lower tear weights than the two species lacking the patch (P lamia and P lena). Forewing length did not explain variation in wing-tear weight, but wing-tear weight was positively related to insect age in a manner consistent with the deflection hypothesis. Older individuals of P lantia and P lena had higher tear weight, whereas this relationship was absent in P astyoche. These results represent the first direct evidence that deflection marks on butterfly wings are relatively weak and should have an increased tendency to tear when handled by a predator.

AB  - Antipredatory displays that incorporate hidden contrasting coloration are found in a variety of different animals. These displays are seen in organisms that have drab coloration at rest, but when disturbed reveal conspicuous coloration. Examples include the bright abdomens of mountain katydids and the colorful underwings of hawk moths. Such hidden displays can function as secondary defenses, enabling evasion of a pursuant predator. To begin to understand why some species have these displays while others do not, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate factors associated with the evolution of hidden contrasting coloration in leaf-footed bugs. First, we investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with body size because these displays are considered to be more effective in larger organisms. We then investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with an alternative antipredatory defense, in this case rapid autotomy. We found that leaf-footed bugs with hidden contrasting coloration tended to autotomize more slowly, but this result was not statistically significant. We also found that the presence of a body size association was dependent upon the form of the hidden color display. Leaf-footed bugs that reveal red/orange coloration were the same size, on average, as species without a hidden color display. However, species that reveal white patches on a black background were significantly larger than species without a hidden color display. These results highlight the diversity of forms that hidden contrasting color signal can take, upon which selection may act differently.

AB  - The nymphalid groundplan (NGP) has proven to be extraordinarily useful in the study of butterfly color patterns because it allows for the identification of homologous elements across species. It has long been thought that the NGP is broadly applicable to all Lepidoptera, implying that the characters which make-up butterfly color patterns are homologous to those found in the moths. However, this conjecture remains mostly untested. We analyzed the wing patterns of the hyper-diverse arctiid tiger moths, which are represented worldwide by approximately 11,000 species, and found that the color patterns of these animals can be parsed into a limited toolkit of homologous characters. Some of the pattern elements identified, such as the basal and central symmetry system, are present on the NGP, but their morphology is often quite different from what is seen in the butterflies. The border ocelli of the NGP appear to be absent altogether in the Arctiidae, and conversely, two distal pattern element we term the "van Bemmelen" and "terminal" bands are present in the color patterns of many arctiids, but are not represented on the NGP. In light of the observed differences, we derive a new theoretical groundplan based on the original NGP that we refer to as the "arctiid archetype." This model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how the wing patterns of these animals develop, and yields novel insight into their evolutionary history.

AB  - Butterflies are among the most colourful organisms in the world and colour plays a central role in many of their life-history strategies. However, the efficacy of coloration strategies in these and other animals could be affected by sudden environmental changes, including anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Here we investigate the effect of forest disturbance gradients on the colours of fruit-feeding butterflies in the Amazon Rainforest. The disturbance gradients tested represented habitat-size (continuous primary forests versus forest fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha) and succession gradients (continuous primary forests, 30 year old secondary forests, and three year old early successional forests). Using digital image analysis, we obtained intrinsic measures of butterfly colour patches corresponding to hue, saturation, brightness, in addition to measures of the contrast among patches and of the overall wing-colour diversity corresponding to 220 individuals, belonging to 60 species. Our results showed that butterflies in the secondary forest and continuous primary forest are more colourful than those found in early succession and fragments of forests. Individuals occurring in forests of early succession showed higher average values of hue and saturation, but lower brightness. Accompanying changes in colour composition, wing-colour diversity among species was lower in human-disturbed habitats, such as those of early forest succession and secondary forest. Forest fragments have smaller effects on butterfly colour composition, indicating that well-structured forest habitats can house butterfly assemblages with more diverse phenotypic features and colours. We show how high deforestation rates in recent years is linked with negative changes in functional coloration strategies (e.g. camouflage, warning colours), something that has to date been poorly explored or demonstrated for butterflies. Specifically, human interference has apparently placed butterflies under strong selection for lower diversity in their colours and range of defensive strategies. Those species that are most colourful are the first to be locally extinguished, likely due to removal of native vegetation and increased exposure to predators, and more broadly owing to inhospitable environmental conditions. This illustrates an accelerated loss of local fauna and a "discolouration" of the Amazonian butterflies due to anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Eyespots are wing color pattern elements repeatedly observed in many butterflies, whose developmental genetics has been extensively documented. Nevertheless, the evolutionary forces shaping their diversification across species still remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the evolution of eyespots in the 30 species of the neotropical genusMorpho.Morphobutterflies display a series of eyespots located on the ventral side of their wings, highly variable among species, ranging from large, conspicuous structures to vestigial spots. Applying geometric morphometrics to a large sample (N= 910) spanning allMorphospecies and both sexes, we assess eyespot number, position, size, and shape. We detect a divergence in eyespot position between understory and canopy species, with an L-shaped configuration in canopy species and a line pattern in understory species, where the eyespots tend to fuse and form a stripe in white and pale species. This effect is stronger than expected based on a Brownian motion model of phylogenetic divergence, suggesting an adaptation to the microhabitat and an influence of the wing color on the evolution of pattern elements. Remarkably, this shift in color pattern is strongly correlated with a shift in wing shape. However, using a thin-plate spline interpolation, we show that the shape change is insufficient to explain the evolution of eyespot position as a developmental side effect of wing shape evolution, also pointing at an adaptive effect. Finally, we find a significant negative correlation between eyespot relative size and the within-species variation in eyespot number, position, size, and shape, suggesting a relaxed or apostatic selection on small eyespots (rare phenotypes being favored as they are less likely to be remembered and thus detected by predators). We hypothesize that contrasted ecology may explain the observed differences between species: large and phenotypically stable eyespots might act as attack deflectors, small, variable faded eyespots might rather enhance crypsis, and pale species stripe pattern might disrupt the outline of the wing.

AB  - Long noted by naturalists, leaf mimicry provides some of the most impressive examples of camouflage through masquerade. Many species of leaf-mimicking Lepidoptera also sport wing markings that closely resemble irregularly shaped holes caused by decay or insect damage. Despite proposals that such markings can either enhance resemblance to damaged leaves or act to disrupt surface appearance through false depth cues, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to establish exactly how these markings function, or even whether they confer a survival benefit to prey. Here, in two field experiments using artificial butterfly-like targets, we show that false hole markings provide significant survival benefits against avian predation. Furthermore, in a computer-based visual search experiment, we demonstrate that detection of such targets by humans is impeded in a similar fashion. Equally contrasting light marks do not have the same effect; indeed, they lead to increased detection. We conclude that the mechanism is the disruption of the otherwise homogeneous wing surface (surface disruptive camouflage) and that, by resembling the holes sometimes found in real leaves, the disruptive benefits are not offset by conspicuousness costs.

AB  - Colorful feathers have long been assumed to be conspicuous to predators, and hence likely to incur costs due to enhanced predation risk. However, many mammals that prey on birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors, rather than the three and four photoreceptors characteristic of humans and most birds, respectively. Here, we use a combination of multispectral imaging, reflectance spectroscopy, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators from multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus), as well as red and yellow parrot feathers. We also model the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by birds against green vegetation, most of the feathers studied are estimated to have color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. On the other hand, for dichromat mammalian predators, visual contrasts for these feathers were only weakly detectable and often below detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We also show that for dichromat mammal vision models, the peacock's train has below-detection threshold color and brightness contrasts and visual textures that match various foliage backgrounds. These findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue to those studied here being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of common mammalian predators of adult birds. Given that birds perform many conspicuous motions and behaviors, this study suggests that mammalian predators are more likely to use other sensory modalities (e.g., motion detection, hearing, and olfaction), rather than color vision, to detect avian prey. This suggests new directions for future behavioral studies and emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the sensory ecology of predators in the evolution of animal coloration.

AB  - Raptors are one of the most important causes of fatalities due to their collisions with aircrafts as well as being the main victims of collisions with constructions. They are difficult to deter because they are not influenced by other airspace users or ground predators. Because vision is the primary sensory mode of many diurnal raptors, we evaluated the reactions of captive raptors to a "superstimulus" (a "paradoxical effect whereby animals show greater responsiveness to an exaggerated stimulus than to the natural stimulus") that combined an "eye shape" stimulus (as many species have an aversion for this type of stimulus) and a looming movement (LE). This looming stimulus mimics an impending collision and induces avoidance in a wide range of species. In captivity, raptors showed a clear aversion for this LE stimulus. We then tested it in a real life setting: at an airport where raptors are abundant. This study is the first to show the efficiency of a visual non-invasive repellent system developed on the basis of both captive and field studies. This system deterred birds of prey and corvids through aversion, and did not induce habituation. These findings suggest applications for human security as well as bird conservation, and further research on avian visual perception and sensitivity to signals.

AB  - The urban environment poses novel anthropogenic challenges to wildlife. Some species have been noted for changes in their behavior in response to humans and urban-associated activities. Understanding the anthropogenic factors which influence these behavioral changes would contribute significantly to avian conservation in an increasingly urbanized world. We investigated the flight initiation distances (FIDs) and alert distances (ADs) of wild Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) in urban and rural habitats of southwestern Virginia to determine if wild songbirds' tolerances for human approaches differed by species or habitat type (urban or rural). We found Song Sparrows to be more tolerant than Northern Cardinals of human approaches, and urban birds of both species tended to tolerate closer approaches than did rural birds. We then investigated whether cues such as gaze direction or human figure explain differences in Song Sparrows' approach response behaviors. We found urban Song Sparrows' FIDs to be significantly shorter than rural birds' FIDs in response to treatments using a human approach for both direct and concealed gazes. However, no significant habitat differences were detected in response to the non-human approach treatments using umbrellas with and without eyespots. Our findings demonstrate risk-tolerance behaviors like AD and FID to vary greatly between species, habitats, and characteristics of the approach.

AB  - The avian retina possesses one of the most diverse complements of photoreceptor types among vertebrates but little is known about their spatial distribution. Here we used retinal wholemounts and stereological methods to present the first complete maps of the topographic distribution of rods and cones in four species of Australian passerines with diverse trophic specializations. All species studied have one central and one temporal rod-free zone. In the insectivorous yellow-rumped thornbill, the central rod-free zone is unusually large, occupying similar to 17% (56 degrees) of the retinal area (angular subtense), whereas in nectarivorous and frugivorous species it represents only similar to 0.1% (5-7 degrees) to 0.3% (10 degrees) of the retinal area (angular subtense). In contrast, the temporal rod-free zone varies little between species (similar to 0.02-0.4%; 2-10 degrees). In all species, rods follow a pronounced dorsoventral gradient with highest densities in the ventral retina. The topographic distribution of cones is concentric and reveals a central fovea and a temporal area. In the yellow-rumped thornbill, cone densities form an extended plateau surrounding the fovea, beyond which densities fall rapidly towards the retinal periphery. For the other species, cone densities decline gradually along a foveal to peripheral gradient. Estimates of spatial resolving power calculated using cone peak densities are higher in the central fovea (19-41 cycles/degree) than in the temporal area (9-15 cycles/degree). In conclusion, we suggest that the unusual organization of the rod-free zone and the distinct topographic distribution of rods and cones correlate with specific ecological needs for enhanced visual sensitivity and spatial resolution in these birds.

AB  - Animal camouflage is a textbook example of natural selection. Despite substantial progress, one historical theory remains controversial: that conspicuous "distractive" markings draw predator attention away from the prey outline, preventing detection. Here, we present evidence from 4 experiments to resolve this controversy. In field experiments, we measured bird predation on artificial cryptic prey that were either unmarked or had distractive markings of various attributes (number, color, and location). Prey with 3 high-contrast distractive markings, and with markings located away from the body outline, suffered reduced survival compared with unmarked controls or prey with low-contrast markings. There was no effect of small single markings with different colors on the survival of targets. In 2 computer-based experiments with human subjects searching for hidden targets, distractive markings of various types (number, size, and location) reduced detection times compared with controls. This effect was greatest for targets that had large or 3 markings. In addition, small and centrally placed markings facilitated faster learning. Therefore, these 2 experimental approaches show that distractive markings are detrimental to camouflage, both facilitating initial detection and increasing the speed of predator learning. Our experiments also suggest that learning of camouflaged prey is dependent on the type of camouflage present. Contrary to current and historical discussion, conspicuous markings are more likely to impair camouflage than enhance it, presenting important implications for the optimization of prey coloration in general.

AB  - Visual patterns in animals may serve different functions, such as attracting mates and deceiving predators. If a signal is used for multiple functions, the opportunity arises for conflict among the different functions, preventing optimization for any one visual signal. Here we investigate the hypothesis that spatial separation of different visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. Using phylogenetic reconstructions of character evolution and comparisons of evolutionary rates, we found dorsal surface characters to evolve at higher rates than ventral characters. Dorsal characters also displayed sex-based differences in evolutionary rates more often than did ventral characters. Thus, dorsal characters corresponded to our predictions of mate signalling while ventral characters appear to play an important role in predator avoidance. Forewing characters also fit a model of mate signalling, and displayed higher rates of evolution than hindwing characters. Our results, as well as the behavioural and developmental data from previous studies of Bicyclus species, support the hypothesis that spatial separation of visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. This study is the first to demonstrate, in a phylogenetic framework, that spatial separation of signals used for mate signalling and those used for predator avoidance is a viable strategy to accommodate multiple signal functions. This signalling strategy has important ramifications on the developmental evolution of wing pattern elements and diversification of butterfly species.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana exhibits phenotypic plasticity involving the wet-season phenotype, which possesses marginal eyespots on the ventral surface of the wings, and the dry-season form, which lacks these eyespots. We examined the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity of B. anynana in relation to the defence mechanisms of crypsis and deflection. We assessed the visibility differences between spotless and spotted butterflies against backgrounds of brown (dry season) or green (wet season) leaves. Spotless butterflies were highly cryptic and less predated by adult bird predators than were spotted ones when presented against brown leaf litter. However, the advantage of crypsis disappeared in the wet-season habitat as both forms were equally visible. In later experiments, naive birds presented with resting butterflies in the wet-season habitat tended to learn more rapidly to capture spotless butterflies, suggesting a slight selective advantage of possessing eyespots. Moreover, marginal eyespots increased significantly the escape probability of butterflies that were attacked by naive birds compared to those attacked by adult birds, although there were no differences in prey capture success within naive predators. Our results show that natural selection acts against eyespots in the dry season, favouring crypsis, whereas in the wet season it may favour eyespots as deflective patterns.

AB  - The Brassolini are among the most noticeable Neotropical butterflies. The adults have showy colorful wings with conspicuous eyespots on the ventral surface. Although Brassolini monophyly is recovered in recent phylogenies, some relationships among their genera remain uncertain and the shortage of information about the immature stages of the tribe probably contributes to the lack of understanding of its systematics. Blepolenis Ro center dot ber, 1906 is a small brassoline genus and the morphology of its immature stages remains largely unknown. In order to provide new data on the morphology and natural history of Blepolenis and contribute to the systematics of the Brassolini, we here describe and illustrate the immature stages of Blepolenis bassus (C. Felder & R. Felder, 1867). The im-matures of Blepolenis bassus show a general morphology similar to other Brassolini immatures. The first instar B. bassus head has two types of setae and the body bears filiform setae (F). The pupa lacks the lateral mirrored spot, seen on known pupae of closely related groups, such as Opsiphanes Doubleday, [1849]. B. bassus larvae feed on Saccharum villosum Steud. (Poaceae) remaining on their hostplant for about one year, and are univoltine, with adults flying in December and January.

AB  - Many animals use shading to infer the three-dimensional (3D) shape of objects, and mimicking natural shading patterns can produce the illusion of 3D form on a flat surface. Over 150 years ago, Charles Darwin noted that the ocelli (eyespots) on the feathers of the great argus Argusianus argus, when held vertically during courtship displays to females, were perfectly shaded to resemble 3D hemispheres to human viewers. We tested whether these ocelli appear 3D to birds by training chickens Gallus gallus domesticus to select images of either convex or concave shapes using shading cues, and then presenting them with images of great argus ocelli. Chickens successfully learned how to discriminate between convex and concave shapes, and treated the great argus pheasant ocelli in the same way as convex training stimuli. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that birds can perceive 3D shape from shading cues in a similar manner to humans. The perception of great argus ocelli as consistent with 3D shape by avian viewers suggests that shape illusions can play a role in male courtship.

AB  - Determining why some animals form groups while others remain solitary is a longstanding goal in behavioural ecology. Group formation can help mitigate predation risk through various mechanisms, including risk dilution and group vigilance. The selfish herd hypothesis proposes that prey can reduce their risk by minimizing the area around which all points in that area are closer to them than to another conspecific (i.e. by minimizing their 'domain of danger' (DOD)). This hypothesis assumes that an individual's predation risk is proportional to the size of its DOD; however, the relationship between risk and proximity to conspecifics may depend on additional factors. Specifically, approaching conspecifics may be costly for prey that rely on crypsis because group formation increases detectability. Using plasticine model prey, we experimentally manipulated prey coloration as well as the DOD, and then tracked their 'survival' under natural field conditions. We found that an individual's predation risk increased with their DOD for conspicuous (red) prey, but decreased with the DOD in cryptic (green) prey. Our results are consistent with patterns in natural systems and indicate that the relationship between predation risk and DOD depends on additional factors like prey coloration.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity in urbanized landscapes is the top most conservation priority. Urban development results in an increase in local extinction rates and eliminates the majority of native species. The pattern of rainfall is changing and frequency of extreme events increasing due to urbanization and rapidly increasing average global temperature. These changes are having observable impacts on biodiversity at species level and ecosystem level, in terms of distribution, composition and function. Mardan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has different habitats; it represents a useful ecological model to identify the effect of habitat heterogeneity on bird communities. We conducted the study to explore the local avian fauna and to compare its composition and diversity in different habitats. Bird species were identified employing point counts method in urban area; agricultural area with small forest chunk and water body. Twenty four point counts were plotted in three well-defined locations such that each location was divided into eight concentric rings of 10 m radius from 0-50 m with an onward interval of 50 m. Thirty five avian species belonging to 23 families and 10 orders were recorded. However, One Way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) indicated significant (P < 0.05) differences in distribution of avian species among habitats. Results suggest that urban area fails to maintain high bird diversity than the adjacent agricultural area. The agricultural area showed the lowest proportion of exclusive species compared to urban area and water body, even though the heterogeneous aspects of the area favor local species richness.

AB  - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is an adolescent hip disorder characterized by displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis relative to the metaphysis. The aim of treatment is to stabilize the proximal epiphysis, avoid further displacement and prevent femoral head osteonecrosis. Open reduction and internal fixation is often required to treat chronic and severe SCFE, typically using a Modified Dunn procedure. This allows anterior access to the proximal femur, epiphyseal mobilization and metaphyseal debridement of cervical callus. Debriding the cervical callus concentrically to allow accurate relocation of the epiphysis on the metaphysis can be challenging. This article describes the benefits of using the Oxford Spherical Mill from a partial knee replacement system to assist with metaphyseal debridement during open epiphyseal reduction and internal fixation for SCFE.

AB  - This study investigated additional and traditional variables from isokinetic test of thigh muscles in soccer players across different field positions. One hundred and eighty-nine athletes performed maximal concentric isokinetic knee contractions on dominant (DL) and non-dominant limb (NDL) at 60o/s and 240o/s. The additional outcomes peak torque angle (AngPT), acceleration time (AcT) and time to peak torque (TPT) and traditional outcomes Peak torque (PT), total work (TW) and power (Pw) were extracted from the exam. Goalkeepers (GK), side backs (SB), central backs (CB), central defender midfielders (CDM), central attacking midfielders (CAM) and forwards (FW) were considered. Comparisons between limbs and positions demonstrated that SB extensors of the DL presented TPT lower (p = 0.006) and AngPT higher (p = 0.011) than NDL at 60 degrees/s. CDM extensors of the DL showed lower TPT at 60 degrees/s (p = 0.003) and 240 degrees/s (p = 0.024). CAM flexors of the DL showed lower TPT (p = 0.026) and AcT (p = 0.021) at 240 degrees/s than NDL. CB, CDM and CAM extensors of the NDL showed higher PT, TW and Pw than DL (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there are muscle imbalances between limbs in SB, CDM and CAM and across different field positions.

AB  - For staring infrared imaging warning equipment, both wide field of view (FOV) surveillance and accurate target detection are urgently demanded. To meet this requirement, we designed an infrared zoom surveillance system based on concentric spherical lens in this study. It consists of a multi-layer concentric spherical lens and an array of independent continuous zoom cameras. With the spherical lens, a wide FOV is achievable benefiting from its structure. The small camera array enables imaging the target scene into sub-regions. And with the continuous zoom ability, the camera array makes it possible for simultaneous wide FOV surveillance and target identification. When potential targets are detected, further determination and identification can be made by zooming in the corresponding camera to provide high-resolution images. Results show that the modulation transfer function (MTF) curves of the infrared imaging system in the full zoom range are close to the diffraction limit. The zoom curve is smooth avoiding the occurrence of jamming, impact and other adverse phenomena in the zoom process. It provides feasible solution for large field monitoring and high-resolution target identification.

AB  - Synopsis The color patterns of butterflies moths are exceptionally diverse, but are very stable within a species, so that most species can be identified on the basis of their color pattern alone. The color pattern is established in the wing imaginal disc during a prolonged period of growth and differentiation, beginning during the last larval instar and ending during the first few days of the pupal stage. During this period, a variety of diffusion and reaction-diffusion signaling mechanisms determine the positions and sizes of the various elements that make up the overall color pattern. The patterning occurs while the wing is growing from a small imaginal disc to a very large pupal wing. One would therefore expect that some or all aspects of the color pattern would be sensitive to the size of the developmental field on which pattern formation takes place. To study this possibility, we analyzed the color patterns of Junonia coenia from animals whose growth patterns were altered by periodic starvation during larval growth, which produced individuals with a large range of variation in body size and wing size. Analyses of the color patterns showed that the positions and size of the pattern elements scaled perfectly isometrically with wing size. This is a puzzling finding and suggests the operation of a homeostatic or robustness mechanism that stabilizes pattern in spite of variation in the growth rate and final size of the wing.

AB  - Currently, a few agricultural corporations are developing and producing a kind of radio-controlled agricultural airboat which could be used to weed and fertilize instead of human in the paddy fields. The authors improved the airboat realizing autonomous navigation by a global-positioning-system (GPS) compass in the previous research. To solve the limitation of GPS-based navigation in bad environment (e.g., areas with tall trees, bad weather conditions, etc.), a new positioning system was proposed by using a computer vision system mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide position information for an agricultural airboat engaged in autonomous fertilizing and herbicide application in this study. The computer vision system included a minicomputer, a color camera with a wide-angle lens, and a Bluetooth transmitter. The UAV was operated to hover high enough to overlook the paddy field by the computer vision system. The colored concentric circular markers were made to put at the corners of the paddy field to facilitate the paddy field recognition using Fitzgibbon ellipse fitting algorithm. Utilize the geographic position by GPS and image position by computer vision system of each markers to obtain the perspective transformation matrix for transforming the top view image of the paddy field. At the created paddy-field-based coordinate, the UAV detects the airboat position by using the white color feature and central symmetrical contour feature of the airboat and transmits the position information to airboat in real time by Bluetooth for airboat navigation. The results of navigation experiment showed that the RMS lateral errors were 0.17 m, 0.10 m and 0.11 m in 3 predefined paths, respectively. This accuracy level was better than that of differential-GPS (DGPS). It is acceptable for providing positioning service for the airboat autonomous navigation in paddy fields. Furthermore, this UAV-airboat solution was a beneficial attempt which can not only prevent the instability of GPS-based airboat navigation in bad environment, but also avoid the herbicide spray drift problem that occurs in UAV-spraying in the air.

AB  - Introduction: Balance of strength and flexibility between the dominant (DL) and non-dominant limbs (NDL) in young soccer players is essential, since it can minimize the possible injury-triggering mechanisms and their negative influence on performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the unilateral and bilateral strength and flexibility between the DL and NDL in young soccer players.
   Material and methods: The sample consisted of 30 individuals (aged 15.97 +/- 0.67 years). The isokinetic strength was measured at the velocities of 60 degrees s and 180 degrees s in the concentric action of the quadriceps and hamstrings as well as eccentric of the hamstrings, and in the conventional and functional ratios, along with hip flexion range of motion.
   Results: The results showed the athletes had an eccentric strength of the hamstrings at 60 degrees s in the DL significantly (p < 0.05) stronger than in the NDL, and the DL had a significant H/Q ratio (p < 0.05) more balanced than the NDL.
   Conclusions: Young soccer athletes may present a non-standard isokinetic results. These results are observed because of the difference in muscle strength of the posterior thigh compared to DL and NDL and the balance relation between the quadriceps and the hamstrings, generating an asymmetry of strength between the limbs and on the same member. It is necessary to monitor and devise training strategies to avoid these imbalances in order to prevent injuries. (C) 2018 FC Barcelona. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many butterfly species, the posterior end of the hindwings of individuals perching with their wings closed resembles a butterfly head. This "false head'' pattern is considered an adaptation to deflect predator attacks to less vulnerable parts of the body. The presence of symmetrical damage in left and right wings is considered evidence of failed predator attacks to perching butterflies. In this research, we tested the prediction derived from the deflection hypothesis that the degree of resemblance of the false head area (FH) to a real head, as measured by the number of FH "components'' (eyespots, "false antennae'', modified outline of the FH area and lines converging on the FH area) present in the hindwings, is positively correlated to the frequency of symmetrical damage in the FH area. We studied specimens from two scientific collections of butterflies of the subfamily Theclinae (Lycaenidae) belonging to the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Coleccion Nacional de Insectos [CNIN] and Museo de Zoologia, Facultad de Ciencias [MZFC]). We scored the presence of symmetrical damage in a sample of 20,709 specimens (CNIN: 3,722; MZFC: 16,987) from 126 species (CNIN: 78 species; MZFC: 117 species; 71 species shared by both collections) whose hindwings vary in the number of FH components, and found that, as predicted, the proportion of specimens with symmetrical damage increases as the number of FH components increases. We also tested the hypothesis that behavioural differences between the sexes makes males more prone to receive predator attacks and, thus, we predicted a higher frequency of symmetrical damage in the FH of males than in that of females. We found that the frequency of symmetrical damage was not significantly different between males and females, suggesting that behavioural differences between the sexes produce no differences in the risk of being attacked. Overall, our results provide support to the idea that the FH of butterflies is an adaptation that deflects predator attacks to less vulnerable parts of the body in both sexes.

AB  - Butterfly eyespot color patterns are traditionally explained by the gradient model, where positional information is stably provided by a morphogen gradient from a single organizer and its output is a set of non-graded (or graded) colors based on pre-determined threshold levels. An alternative model is the induction model, in which the outer black ring and the inner black core disk of an eyespot are specified by graded signals from the primary and secondary organizers that also involve lateral induction. To examine the feasibility of these models, we analyzed eyespot color gradients, boundary scales, and rudimentary eyespots in various nymphalid butterflies. Most parts of eyespots showed color gradients with gradual or fluctuating changes with sharp boundaries in many species, but some species had eyespots that were composed of a constant color within a given part. Thus, a plausible model should be flexible enough to incorporate this diversity. Some boundary scales appeared to have two kinds of pigments, and others had "misplaced" colors, suggesting an overlapping of two signals and a difficulty in assuming sharp threshold boundaries. Rudimentary eyespots of three Junonia species revealed that the outer black ring is likely determined first and the inner yellow or red ring is laterally induced. This outside-to-inside determination together with the lateral induction may favor the induction model, in which dynamic signal interactions play a major role. The implications of these results for the ploidy hypothesis and color-pattern rules are discussed.

AB  - Butterflies often use their dorsal and ventral wing color patterns for distinct signaling functions. Color patterns on hidden dorsal wing surfaces are often used in sexual signaling, while exposed ventral patterns are often used to ward off predator attacks. At rest, however, part of the ventral forewings are often hidden by the hindwings, allowing individuals to also use the patterns on this wing surface for sexual signaling. Here, we test this hypothesis in Bicyclus anynana (Butler, Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) butterflies by first determining the degree of sexual dimorphism in ventral forewing patterns, focusing on the eyespots, from both wet and dry season forms, and then testing the role of the larger ventral forewing eyespots of dry season females in male mate choice. We also test male investment in reproduction. We show that ventral forewing UV-reflective eyespot centers, in addition to dorsal forewing eyespot centers previously examined in this species, play a role in sexual signaling as males preferentially mated with females with their ventral eyespot centers intact instead of blocked with black paint. This male preference, however, did not translate into a detectable higher reproductive investment via a single mating toward ornamented females. This study provides an example of how ventral forewing patterns, often hidden by hindwings, are used in sexual communication, in this case by females to attract males.

AB  - Day-camouflaged leaf-mimic katydids Typophyllum spp. have a remarkable way of evading predators as male and female forewings appear as bite-damaged leaves complete with necrotic spots. As in all other katydids, males produce sound signals to attract females by rubbing their forewings together. The biophysical properties of these special leaf-like forewings remain obscure. Here we study the wing mechanics and resonances of Typophyllum spurioculis, a new species of leaf-mimic katydid with a broad distribution in the Andes from Western Ecuador to the middle Central Cordillera in Colombia. This species performs an unusual laterally directed aposematic display, showing orange spots that simulate eyes at the leg base. At night, males are conspicuous by their loud, audible calling songs, which exhibit two spectral peaks at ca. 7 and 12 kHz. Using micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometry we find the effective sound radiators of the wings (speculae) vibrate with three modes of vibration, two of which include the frequencies observed in the calling song. Remarkably, this resonance is preserved in the parts of the wings mimicking necrotic leaves, which are in theory not specialised for sound production. The eyespot function is discussed.

AB  - Context: Sport-specific adaptations at the glenohumeral joint could occur in adolescent athletes because they start participating in high-performance sports in early childhood.
   Objective: To investigate shoulder-rotator strength, internal-rotation (IR) and external-rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM), and acromiohumeral distance (AHD) in asymptomatic adolescent volleyball attackers to determine if they have risk factors for injury.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: University laboratory.
   Participants: Thirty-nine adolescent high school-aged volleyball attackers (22 boys, 17 girls; age = 16.0 +/- 1.4 years, height = 179.2 +/- 9.0 cm, mass = 67.1 +/- 10.9 kg, body mass index = 20.7 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2)).
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Shoulder IR and ER ROM, total-rotation ROM, glenohumeral IR deficit, AHD, and concentric and eccentric strength of the shoulder internal and external rotators were tested bilaterally.
   Results: External-rotation ROM was greater (t(38) = 4.92, P < .001), but IR ROM (t(38) = -8.61, P < .001) and total ROM (t(38) = -3.55, P = .01) were less in the dominant shoulder, and 15 athletes had a glenohumeral IR deficit (IR ROM loss >18 degrees). We observed greater concentric internal-rotator (t(38) = 2.89, P = .006) and eccentric external-rotator (t(38) = 2.65, P = .01) strength in the dominant than in the nondominant shoulder. The AHD was less in the dominant shoulder (t(38) = -3.60, P < .001).
   Conclusions: Adolescent volleyball attackers demonstrated decreased IR ROM, total ROM, and AHD and increased ER ROM in their dominant shoulder. Therefore, routine screening of adolescent athletes and designing training programs for hazardous adaptive changes could be important in preventing shoulder injuries.

AB  - Background: Developmental studies on butterfly wing color patterns often focus on eyespots. A typical eyespot (such as that of Bicyclus anynana) has a few concentric rings of dark and light colors and a white spot (called a focus) at the center. The prospective eyespot center during the early pupal stage is known to act as an organizing center. It has often been assumed, according to gradient models for positional information, that a white spot in adult wings corresponds to an organizing center and that the size of the white spot indicates how active that organizing center was. However, there is no supporting evidence for these assumptions. To evaluate the feasibility of these assumptions in nymphalid butterflies, we studied the unique color patterns of Calisto tasajera (Nymphalidae, Satyrinae), which have not been analyzed before in the literature.
   Results: In the anterior forewing, one white spot was located at the center of an eyespot, but another white spot associated with either no or only a small eyespot was present in the adjacent compartment. The anterior hindwing contained two adjacent white spots not associated with eyespots, one of which showed a sparse pattern. The posterior hindwing contained two adjacent pear-shaped eyespots, and the white spots were located at the proximal side or even outside the eyespot bodies. The successive white spots within a single compartment along the midline in the posterior hindwing showed a possible trajectory of a positional determination process for the white spots. Several cases of focus-less eyespots in other nymphalid butterflies were also presented.
   Conclusions: These results argue for the uncoupling of white spots from eyespot bodies, suggesting that an eyespot organizing center does not necessarily differentiate into a white spot and that a prospective white spot does not necessarily signify organizing activity for an eyespot. Incorporation of these results in future models for butterfly wing color pattern formation is encouraged.

AB  - This study investigated the spatial distribution of an Amazonian fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage by linking species taxonomic and functional approaches. We hypothesized that: 1) vegetation richness (i.e., resources) and abundance of insectivorous birds (i.e., predators) should drive changes in butterfly taxonomic composition, 2) larval diet breadth should decrease with increase of plant species richness, 3) small-sized adults should be favored by higher abundance of birds, and 4) communities with eyespot markings should be able to exploit areas with higher predation pressure. Fruit-feeding butterflies were sampled with bait traps and insect nets across 25 km(2) of an Amazonian ombrophilous forest in Brazil. We measured larval diet breadth, adult body size, and wing marking of all butterflies. Our results showed that plant species richness explained most of the variation in butterfly taxonomic turnover. Also, community average diet breadth decreased with increase of plant species richness, which supports our expectations. In contrast, community average body size increased with the abundance of birds, refuting our hypothesis. We detected no influence of environmental gradients on the occurrence of species with eyespot markings. The association between butterfly taxonomic and functional composition points to a mediator role of the functional traits in the environmental filtering of butterflies. The incorporation of the functional approach into the analyses allowed for the detection of relationships that were not observed using a strictly taxonomic perspective and provided an extra insight into comprehending the potential adaptive strategies of butterflies.

AB  - Purpose and methods The anal sinuses, small furrows above the pectinate line, sometimes form perianal abscesses in adults. We examined the pattern of fetal growth of the anal sinus and sphincters using 22 mid-term (8-18 weeks) and 6 late-stage (30-38 weeks) fetuses.
   Results In mid-term fetuses, the external and internal sphincters gradually increased in thickness, depending on specimen size (from 0.2 to 1.5 mm), whereas the anteroposterior diameter of the anal canal at the epithelial junction was relatively stable (0.5-1.0 mm) irrespective of specimen size. Anal canal diameter increased less than twofold between mid-term and late-stage fetuses, from 0.5-1.0 to almost 2 mm, whereas sphincter thickness increased over tenfold, from 0.2-1.5 to almost 3.5 mm. The anal sinus often showed balloon-like enlargement when the sphincter muscle bundles were tightly packed in mid-term, but not in late-stage fetuses.
   Conclusions Large concentric mechanical stress from the sphincters in late-stage fetuses apparently prevented the anal sinus from expanding in a balloon-like manner. Conversely, to avoid anal stenosis, the growing sinuses maintained a luminal space of the anal canal in response to stress from rapidly growing sphincters. The inferiorly extending sinus usually provided temporal double canals separated by a thick column. In the presence of double lumens, anal canal duplication is likely to develop without any abnormalities of the anal epithelium and sphincters.

AB  - MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) modelling method is probably the most popular technique to model species distributions based only on the presence records across broad spatial scales. Although it is widely used, there is much controversy about the transferability of models between different geographical areas. Transferability might be more questionable when it comes to predict the distribution of peripheral populations at the margin of the species geographical range, where they may be affected by and adapted to environmental conditions different from those of core populations. To explore transferability of MaxEnt models among sectors of the geographic range, we selected three butterfly species with wide distributions and peripheral populations at their southernmost margin in the Iberian Peninsula, namely Plebejus argus, Cyaniris semiargus and Pyronia tithonus.
   Using data from the Atlas of the butterflies of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands as well as both climate and land use data, we modelled their potential distribution ranges in Spain. In addition, we also independently modelled their distributions separately in three concentric sectors of their range. We then investigated the transferability of the models between sectors and the effect of varying the regularization parameter.
   Our results show that when developing species distribution models the quality of occurrence data should be carefully checked, paying special attention to both their number and spatial distribution and avoiding possible significant biases.
   The transferability of the models tends to decrease when data from increasingly distant sectors are used as test data. More precisely, and independently of the regularization parameter value, models built using occurrence data either from the core or the intermediate sectors failed to adequately predict the distribution of the three butterfly species in the peripheral sector, especially in Donana National Park.

AB  - Traditionally, researchers in forensics note that upon arriving on the studied territory, the investigator: 1) assists in the remediation of crimes endangering victims and other persons; 2) assists in the in the remediation of crimes threatening material objects; 3) checks the quality of the implemented measures for the preservation of the traces of the crime; 4) decides on the need in additional measures aimed at the preservation of the traces of the crime; 5) obtains background information about the crime and the actions of public officials and witnesses on the scene; 6) explains the rights and responsibilities to the participants of search and investigative actions. The complex of tactical and forensic tasks at this stage consists in the analysis of the initial information, selection of the optimal search method, search optimization in relation to a particular site, search potential optimization of the participants of search and investigative actions. The basic principle of organizing the activities of the investigator in conducting the examination of the scene is united command over the examination. In addition to the investigator, operational staff, experts, specialists participate in the examination / search. United command over the examination / search will prevent from uncoordinated actions that may damage the traces and change the position and the status of certain objects. The investigator plans the examination / search, allocates responsibilities among its members, defines the borders of the territory subject to examination / search and the direction of movement. The group works effectively in cases where there is an analytical and coordination center that coordinates actions of participants of search and investigative actions and appropriateness of their actions. There is another reason for the desirability of avoiding anarchy in the examination of the scene. The search and intellectual capacity of the group is not the sum of the search and intellectual components of its participants, but rather the capacity of the least developed member of the group, which can be neutralized by the principle of the unity of command. Studies on the optimal search method in a criminal investigation have a rather poor history. It is at the initial stage of formation of tactical and forensic recommendations, when it became clear that the usual, unsystematic and chaotic search is unacceptable in the investigation of crimes. Initially, objective and subjective ways of search were distinguished, mostly adapted to the conditions of the investigatory examination. These algorithms are somehow present in modern forensics in the form of the full and selective search methods which, of course, cannot be considered appropriate. Merely all experts in forensics allocate eccentric, concentric and frontal search methods; their content and problems of application are considered in the article.

AB  - Hermeuptychia intricata Grishin, sp. n. is described from the Brazos Bend State Park in Texas, United States, where it flies synchronously with Hermeuptychia sosybius (Fabricius, 1793). The two species differ strongly in both male and female genitalia and exhibit 3.5% difference in the COI barcode sequence of mitochondrial DNA. Setting such significant genitalic and genotypic differences aside, we were not able to find reliable wing pattern characters to tell a difference between the two species. This superficial similarity may explain why H. intricata, only distantly related to H. sosybius, has remained unnoticed until now, despite being widely distributed in the coastal plains from South Carolina to Texas, USA (and possibly to Costa Rica). Obscuring the presence of a cryptic species even further, wing patterns are variable in both butterflies and ventral eyespots vary from large to almost absent. To avoid confusion with the new species, neotype for Papilio sosybius Fabricius, 1793, a common butterfly that occurs across northeast US, is designated from Savannah, Georgia, USA. It secures the universally accepted traditional usage of this name. Furthermore, we find that DNA barcodes of Hermeuptychia specimens from the US, even those from extreme south Texas, are at least 4% different from those of H. hermes (Fabricius, 1775)-type local-Brazil: Rio de Janeiro- and suggest that the name H. hermes should not be used for USA populations, but rather reserved for the South American species. This conclusion is further supported by comparison of male genitalia. However, facies, genitalia and 2.1% different DNA barcodes set Hermeuptychia populations in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas apart from H. sosybius. These southern populations, also found in northeastern Mexico, are described here as Hermeuptychia hermybius Grishin, sp. n. (type locality Texas: Cameron County). While being phylogenetically closer to H. sosybius than to any other Hermeuptychia species, H. hermybius can usually be recognized by wing patterns, such as the size of eyespots and the shape of brown lines on hindwing. "Intricate Satyr" and "South Texas Satyr" are proposed as the English names for H. intricata and H. hermybius, respectively.

AB  - In the article, the author reflects on the importance of word marks which are traditionally used only in an abbreviated form and occupy a modest place in the structure of the dictionary entry: in the headword zone - before or after the word meaning interpretation, in the illustration zone - at the end of the entry. Meanwhile marks play an important role in characterizing the word and its function in the text: they indicate its grammatical properties - gender (m., f., n.), number (s. or pl.), case (N., G., D., etc.), style (coll., elev., lit.), expressiveness (expr., emot., rude), geography (Msc. (Moscow), Sib. (Siberia), Tom. (Tomsk), etc.).
   The author expresses the idea of linguoculturological marks, their meanings and types. The following marks are characterized: personification (Russian: olits.) representing a thing as if it were human, zoomorphism (zoom.) - as if it were an animal, phytomorphism (fitom.) - a plant, artefact-morphism (artef.) - a product of human activity, myth-morphism (mifom.) - a mythical creature, nature-morphism (natur.) - a property of a natural object, locus-morphism (lokom.) - a spatial parameter, phonomorphism (fonom.) - a sound made by people, animals, objects, elements, anthropomorphism (antrop.) - an anthropomorphic image expressed by metaphorical transfers within the semantic sphere "person".
   The article provides illustrations of all the aforementioned types of marks. Here are some of them: personification. Glazok ('eye, eyespot, speculum'). Olits. 'round spot, sometimes rimmed, in the figure, pattern, color, animals, etc.' - Each butterfly wing had a big eye-shaped spot of bluish purple. Aksakov. Collecting Butterflies. Anthropomorphism. Metit' ('to aim'). Antrop. 'try to take any post, position, etc., as if intending to hit the target'. - At first, everyone thought him [Menshikov] to be the king's jester, but he aimed higher. A. Tolstoy. Peter the First. Myth-morphism. Besnovat'sya ('to rage'). Mifom. 'fall into extreme excitement, to behave as if possessed by a demon'. - Marya Alekseyevna had long been raging... finally she got tired of shouting. Chernyshevsky. What Is to Be Done? Arte-fact-morphism. Seryozhki ('aiglets'). Artef. 'blossom clusters of small flowers in woody plants that fall off completely after blooming'. - Aspens have dropped furry aiglets that looked like shaggy caterpillars on the forest paths. Liverovskiy. In a Green Dress. Nature-morphism. Tumanit'sya ('to dim'). Natur. 'veil, cloud, losing the ability to see clearly ( about eyes, look'). - Kak chasto, grustnymi mechtami / Tomimyy, na tebya glyazhu, / I vzor tumanitsya slezami ('How often by sad dreams / Tormented, I look at you, / And my look dims with tears').

AB  - The aim of the study was to verify whether 8 weeks of resistance training employing maximal isokinetic eccentric (IERT) knee extensor actions would reduce the acute force loss observed after high-intensity treadmill running exercise. It was hypothesized that specific IERT would induce protective effects against muscle fatigue and ultrastructural damages, preventing or reducing the loss in mechanical muscle function after running. Subjects were tested before and after IERT protocol for maximal isometric, concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee extensor strength (60A degrees and 180A degrees A s(-1)). In a second session, subjects performed treadmill running (similar to 35 min) and the previously mentioned measurements were repeated immediately after running. Subsequently, subjects were randomized to training (n = 12) consisting of 24 sessions of maximal IERT knee extensors actions at 180A degrees A s(-1), or served as controls (n = 8). The effects of acute running-induced fatigue and training on isokinetic and isometric peak torque, and rate of force development (RFD) were investigated. Before IERT, running-induced eccentric torque loss at 180A degrees A s(-1) was -8 %, and RFD loss was -11 %. Longitudinal IERT led to reduced or absent acute running-induced losses in maximal IERT torque at 180A degrees A s(-1) (+2 %), being significantly reduced compared to before IERT (p < 0.05), however, RFD loss remained at -11 % (p > 0.05). In conclusion, IERT yields a reduced strength loss after high-intensity running workouts, which may suggest a protective effect against fatigue and/or morphological damages. However, IERT may not avoid reductions in explosive muscle actions. In turn, this may allow more intense training sessions to be performed, facilitating the adaptive response to running training.

TI  - The Plan Zuid in Words Changing Notions in Urbanism and an Unknown Plan
T2  - BULLETIN KNOB
LA  - Dutch
AB  - Looking at H.P. Berlage's famous Plan Zuid ('South Plan') for Amsterdam by examining the notions that were used and are still being used to describe his design, we gain new insights into the design, into the notions themselves and into the way in which historic plans and their explanations are to be seen in their interrelatedness.
   From studying Berlage's Explanatory Memorandum it immediately becomes clear that the well-known plan that is usually depicted does not reflect the original design. In this presentation map of the Office of Public Works from 1917 the emphasis is on uniform buildings, leaving the public space in a unelaborated state. The original plan from March 1915 has a different focus with more attention to a detailed public space, including street profiles and directives for special buildings in special places. This plan is also more in line with the accompanying bird's-eye views and with Berlage's own writings on urbanism.
   By looking at the designed phenomena of the original plan (the referents), all of the notions from Berlage's Explanatory Memorandum have been examined, divided into three categories: public spaces, buildings and the city and its elements. Notions used by contemporaries were also looked at (synchronic) and a comparison was made with the present (diachronic). Berlage's design was based on a hierarchical street network, which he developed in profiles with different spatial characteristics defined at four levels: '(breede) verkeersweg'/'(broad) traffic road', 'straalvormige hoofdstraat'/'radial main street', 'ringvormige hoofdstraat'/'concentric main street' and 'woonstraat'/'domestic street'. The most conspicuous of these are the 60 m wide 'verkeerswegen'/'traffic roads' or 'Parkwegen'/'Parkways', which were already also called 'boulevards' or 'lanen'/'avenues' at the the time. The notions of 'weg'Proad' and 'straat'/'street.' were almost interchangeable in practice, as it turned out. For his few urban waterways Berlage consistently used the word 'gracht'/'canar- which at the time was less associated with the urban profile-even though his contemporaries also used the more neutral word 'kanaal'/'waterway'. The remaining public spaces, such as 'park' and 'plein'/'square' were less important and also less interesting as notions.
   The housing consisted of three classes: eengezinshuizen'/ 'single family houses', 'tweegezinshuizen'/'two family houses' and 'volksklassehuizen'/' working class houses'. In the latter two categories one 'huis'/'house' contained several 'woningen'/'apartments'. Various synonyms were used for these notions. By contrast, the many public buildings were designated in more unequivocal terms. Berlage also included 'bijzondere bebouwing'/'special buildings' with 'a certain monumentality' and he argued in favour of 'blokbouw'Pblock building', a notion that could refer to 'building in closed blocks', but especially to 'building in large architectural units'. As to the city elements it is interesting to note that in Berlage's day the words 'wijk'/'quarter' and 'buurt'/'neighbourhood' were synonyms, whereas nowadays they indicate a difference in scale, possibly under the influence of modernist urbanism.
   The research into Plan Zuid has demonstrated that notions are always in flux. In terms of synchrony especially the partly overlapping notions are interesting, as are those notions about which there is no consensus yet. In terms of diachrony especially those notions stand out in which an almost imperceptible change in meaning has occurred. Those notions in particular have led to the general conclusion that in studying historic explanations of plans one must always consciously look at the contemporary meaning and the referents of the words that are used, if one is to interpret them correctly.

AB  - To increase wetland acreage and biodiversity, state agencies constructed more than 220 depressional wetlands throughout Delaware. We investigated effects of landscape composition within 1,000 m and 5,000 m of 20 Kent County, Delaware constructed wetlands on their avian, macroinvertebrate, and vegetative communities. Using digital orthophotography and geographic information system (GIS), we quantified agriculture, early successional, forest, development, freshwater wetlands, roads, and streams within concentric buffers. We also calculated distance to nearest forest, wetland, and paved road edge from the wetland's center. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the biotic communities and regressed richness and diversity values against landscape variables. Proximity of nearest forest edge was the most important variable in explaining avian and vegetative richness and diversity. We detected negative relationships with distance to nearest forest and bird richness, bird diversity, total plant richness, facultative wetland plant cover, and native, exotic, and obligate wetland plant richness and cover. Furthermore, bird richness and diversity increased with forest area within 1,000 m and bird diversity increased with forest area within 5,000 m. To optimize biodiversity, managers should consider proximity to forest for wetlands constructed in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The thermodynamic characterization as well as the rheological characterization of the A201 alloy were conducted. Thermodynamic simulations (CALPHAD method) and calorimetric experiments were performed to determine the solidus and liquidus temperatures, the melting range and the sensitivity of the solid fraction at the thixoforming temperatures. The rheology of aluminium alloy A201 was examined using a high temperature Searle rheometer. The flow behaviour was analyzed with concentric cylinders of graphite to avoid chemical interactions with the liquid or semi-solid aluminium. The rotational body was grooved to prevent a phenomenon called wall slippage. Continuous cooling experiment was used to observe the shear rate effects on the flow behaviour. It can be seen that the viscosity level decreases at higher shear rates. Shear rate jump experiment was carried out to evaluate the steady state flow curve within the analyzed shear rate range from 60 s(-1) to 260 s(-1). It is found that the power law indexes are -1.35 and -1.49 for 35% and 45% solid fraction, respectively. Finally, some mechanical property data of as-cast and as-thixoformed A201 alloy are included indicating the potential for high strength applications.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a very infrequent disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. The main clinical features of IHCP at presentation are headache, cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, and seizures. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) have not previously been reported as a main clinical manifestation. We present a case with TIA as the main clinical manifestation and investigated the treatment of the case.
   Case Report: A 33-year-old male complaining of recurrent left hemiparesis for 22 days was admitted into our hospital. The clinical characteristics and CT, MRI, and pathological data were investigated carefully. IHCP was diagnosed and pulse corticosteroid therapy was used to treat this case. Headache, neck pain and recurrent episodes of weakness and numbness in the left limbs were the main clinical manifestations. CT and MRI revealed thickening of the dura along the falx and tentorium. Meningeal biopsy showed diffused thickening of the dura, consisting of collagen in concentric form with inflammatory cell infiltrating and fibrinoid necrosis, confirmed to be dura mater by histopathological examination. Treatment with an antiplatelet drug, low molecular heparin and herbs did not prevent the attacks. Pulse corticosteroid therapy was used and good efficiency was achieved.
   Conclusions: Recurrent episodes of TIAs can be the main clinical manifestations of IHCP, and pulse corticosteroid therapy was effective.

AB  - In strong earthquake events, multi-story concentrically braced steel frames (CBFs) are prone to form a story-collapse mechanism after buckling and yielding of the braces in a story. With the addition of continuous gravity columns and the increased lateral stiffness and strength they provide, however, it becomes possible to reduce the concentration of story drift and prevent the story collapse. Nonlinear dynamic analysis is implemented for a three-story CBF, and it is demonstrated that a drift concentration is inevitable, particularly in the first story, when the CBF is subjected to a set of large ground motions with a probability of exceedance of 2% in 50 years. A simplified theoretical formulation is presented to characterize the effect of gravity columns. Two cases are considered: gravity columns perfectly fixed, and gravity columns pinned at the base. It is noted that significant mitigation of drift concentration can be achieved, particularly when gravity columns are fixed at the base. Nonlinear time-history analysis is further performed to validate the theoretical observations and quantify the stiffness/strength demands of gravity columns to avoid drift concentration. The analysis results support the trends and observations obtained from the theoretical formulation. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented with the seismic force reduction factor Ds, slenderness ratio of braces x, and number of stories, as major analysis variables. The results demonstrate that a few (e.g. four) fixed-base gravity columns can lead to collapse prevention for reasonably designed low-rise CFBs under the set of large ground motions.

AB  - The iridescent metallic green beetle, Chrysina gloriosa, which selectively reflects left circularly polarized light, possesses an exoskeleton decorated by hexagonal cells (similar to 10 mu m) that coexist with pentagons and heptagons. The fraction of hexagons decreases with an increase in curvature. In bright field microscopy, each cell contains a bright yellow core, placed in a greenish cell with yellowish border, but the core disappears in dark field. With use of confocal microscopy, we observe that these cells consist of nearly concentric nested arcs that lie on the surface of a shallow cone. We infer that the patterns are structurally and optically analogous to the focal conic domains formed spontaneously on the free surface of a cholesteric liquid crystal. These textures provide the basis for the morphogenesis as well as key insights for emulating the intricate optical response of the exoskeleton of scarab beetles.

AB  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are composed of anatomically identifiable pattern elements, whose positional relations are idealized in the "nymphalid groundplan". But the status of the parafocal element and submarginal band (which are collectively called "the peripheral elements" for convenience) in this ground-plan has been ambiguous. Herein, I descriptively analyze homologous color-patterns of the parafocal elements in the representative nymphalid butterflies. Cases are presented where the distal and proximal peripheral elements are symmetric on the evespot focal axis, they are continuous around eyespots, and a given parafocal element shows a concentric pattern. Multi-compartmental comparison of the consecutive parafocal elements on a given wing surface indicates that the relative locations of the parafocal elements can correlate with the eyespot size and that a peripheral part of an evespot can be "disconnected" from its focal part. These cases suggest the fundamental difficulty in unequivocally distinguishing the parafocal element from the eyespot at least in some nymphalid species. Taken together, it appears that the parafocal element is developmentally regulated by the organizing activity of the prospective eyespot focus, and thus they are to be considered as a part of the border symmetry system. However, the parafocal element also seems to be organized by its own focus that acts as the secondary organizing center at least in some species. These conclusions based on the natural color-patterns are in good agreement with those based on the physiologically-induced color-pattern changes.

AB  - Even if an animal matches its surroundings perfectly in colour and texture, any mismatch between the spatial phase of its pattern and that of the background, or shadow created by its three-dimensional relief, is potentially revealing. Nevertheless, for camouflage to be fully broken, the shape must be recognizable. Disruptive coloration acts against object recognition by the use of high-contrast internal colour boundaries to break up shape and form. As well as the general outline, characteristic features such as eyes and limbs must also be concealed; this can be achieved by having the colour patterns on different, but adjacent, body parts aligned to match each other (i.e. in phase). Such 'coincident disruptive coloration' ensures that there is no phase disjunction where body parts meet, and causes different sections of the body to blend perceptually. We tested this theory using field experiments with predation by wild birds on artificial moth-like targets, whose wings and (edible pastry) bodies had colour patterns that were variously coincident or not. We also carried out an experiment with humans searching for analogous targets on a computer screen. Both experiments show that coincident disruptive coloration is an effective mechanism for concealing an otherwise revealing body form.

CP  - 6th International Conference on Behaviour of Steel Structures in Seismic Areas
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - In strong earthquake events, concentrically braced steel frames (CBFs) are prone to form a story-collapse mechanism after buckling of the braces in a story. However, with the presence of continuous gravity columns, it becomes possible to reduce the concentration of story drift thanks to the addition of lateral stiffness and strength. Nonlinear dynamic analysis is implemented for a three-story CBF, and it is demonstrated that a drift concentration is inevitable particularly in the first story under large ground motions. Simplified theoretical formulation is presented to characterize the effect of gravity columns. It is noted that significant mitigation of drift concentration can be achieved particularly when gravity columns are fixed at the base. Numerical analysis is also performed to quantify the stiffness/strength demands of gravity columns to avoid drift concentration. The results demonstrate that a few, e.g., four, fixed-base gravity columns can warrant the performance of collapse prevention for a reasonably designed low-rise CFB under large ground motions.

AB  - Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is a life-threatening disorder for both mother and fetus; cardiac dysfunction Is the major complication and can result In further deterioration. Recently, it has been recognized that aberrant activation of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of PIH, but the details of the relationship between cardiac injury and enhanced AT1 signaling In PIH are still unclear. We previously generated a transgenic mouse model of pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH) via overproduction of angiotensin II, an endogenous ligand of AT1, in the maternal circulation during late pregnancy. In the present study, we administered olmesartan, an AT1 blocker, to suppress redundant AT1 signaling in PAH mice and evaluated the efficacy of this treatment in cardiac remodeling. olmesartan treatment significantly lowered the blood pressure of PAH mice, and hypertrophy as well as increased plasma levels of cardiac Injury markers were also markedly reduced. Histological analyses revealed that morphological abnormalities and fibrosis in the hearts of PAH mice recovered to the levels of normal pregnant wildtype mice after the administration of olmesartan. Moreover, in fibrotic regions of PAH hearts, olmesartan treatment significantly decreased the extent of cardiac injury and apoptosis. These results Indicate that the activation of AT1 signaling pathways during maternal hypertension plays a critical role in cardiac remodeling in PAH mice, and suggest that treatment with an AT1 blocker could effectively ameliorate cardiac dysfunction during pregnancy with hypertension In vivo.

AB  - In order to avoid the formation of normal cracks in the external layer of multilayered ceramic coatings during cooling, determination of the residual thermal stress field is essential. Concerning the effect of the intermediate layers (transition zone) on a possible reduction of stress in the external layer, it has been shown that in the case of a symmetrical (or constrained in-plane strain) system, reduction only occurs over a critical substrate thickness. In order to investigate the effect of the substrate geometry, the residual thermal stress field has also been determined in other configurations such as an asymmetrical arrangement (one side coating) allowing bending and a concentric-cylinder structure. In these last two configurations, a strong stress reduction is obtained. For practical applications such as gas turbine ceramic components, these results may provide guidelines for an optimum design of the geometry of substrate and intermediate layers of multilayered ceramic coatings.

AB  - Gaudy plumage coloration is a widespread ornamental trait in birds and thought to be sexually selected. Although much attention has been devoted to structural coloration reflecting in UV, the signaling function of structural colors lacking UV reflectance and those that exhibit iridescence coloration are poorly documented. The train of the peacock (Pavo cristatus), a classical example of a sexually selected trait, is composed of iridescent structurally colored eyespots not reflecting in UV. Until today, the role played by the structural color of the eyespots in female mate choice has never been investigated using spectrometry. We measured eyespot coloration from a stationary angle (static coloration) and the change in coloration resulting from different angles (iridescent coloration). We assessed coloration with reflectance spectrometry, and we analyzed reflectance spectra using 2 methods. First, we extracted the reflectance spectra shape descriptors hue, brightness, and chroma. Second, we computed color and brightness contrasts signaled by eyespot feathers, taking peafowl color visual sensitivity into account. Iridescence was estimated by the maximal change for all parameters. Brightness was correlated with male mating success. The maximal change in color contrast was correlated with both the frequency of male visitation by females and male mating success. These results suggest that peahens can use both static and dynamic (i.e., iridescent) aspects of plumage structural coloration as signals to detect and choose their mates.

AB  - Foraging habitat selection of nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) was investigated within an estuary with extensive impounded salt marsh habitat. Using a geographic information system, available habitat was partitioned into concentric bands at five, ten, and 15 km radius from nesting colonies to assess the relative effects of habitat composition and distance on habitat selection. Snowy Egrets were more likely than Great Egrets to depart colonies and travel to foraging sites in groups, but both species usually arrived at sites that were occupied by other wading birds. Mean flight distances were 6.2 km (SE = 0.4, N = 28, range 1.8-10.7 km) for Great Egrets and 4.7 km (SE = 0.48, N = 31, range 0.7-12.5 km) for Snowy Egrets. At the broadest spatial scale both species used impounded (mostly salt marsh) and estuarine edge habitat more than expected based on availability while avoiding unimpounded (mostly fresh water wetland) habitat. At more local scales habitat use matched availability. Interpretation of habitat preference differed with the types of habitat that were included and the maximum distance that habitat was considered available. These results illustrate that caution is needed when interpreting the results of habitat preference studies when individuals are constrained in their choice of habitats, such as for central place foragers.

AB  - A fundamental issue of collective intelligence is whether the collective pattern or process is based on environmental information that explicitly codes for it or arises through self-organization of the individuals. Sometimes, these alternatives occur together. Adaptive systems may also be capable of utilizing different types of mechanism under different conditions. Sendova-Franks et al. (Anim Behav 68:1095-1106, 2004) demonstrated evidence for a self-organization mechanism of brood sorting in the ant Temnothorax albipennis, where the brood are sorted in a series of bands or concentric annuli that increase in size with distance from the colony centre. The work by Cox and Blanchard (J Theor Biol 204:223-238, 2000) suggests an alternative or complementary mechanism whereby the brood pattern is specified by the template of a CO2 gradient. Here, we test for a gaseous template as a necessary condition for brood sorting. Under the experimental condition, we pumped the air out of the nest continuously to prevent the accumulation of any gaseous substances. We compared the brood pattern between the experimental and control conditions according to four characteristics: mean distance from centre, mean nearest-neighbour distance, shape and area. Under the experimental condition, the order of brood types according to the first two characteristics was the same as in the control. The area of the brood pattern was smaller, and its shape elongated under the experimental condition. As expected on the basis of these differences, mean distance from centre was greater and mean nearest-neighbour distance was smaller under the experimental condition (although not statistically significantly) and by the expected amount. We found evidence that ants avoid placing brood in the strongest airflow stream. This could explain the reduced area and elongated shape of the brood pattern under the experimental condition. We conclude that a gaseous template is not a necessary condition for brood sorting.

AB  - The organization of tubules and blood vessels in the quail medullary cone is highly structured. This structural organization may result in preferential interactions among tubules and vessels, interactions that may enhance urine concentrating capability. In this study, we formulate a model framework for the urine concentrating mechanism of the quail kidney. The model simulates preferential interactions among renal tubules by representing two concentric cores and by specifying the fractions of tubules assigned to each of the concentric cores. The model equations are based on standard expressions for transmural transport and on solute and water conservation. Model results suggest that the preferential interactions among tubules enhance the urine concentration capacity of short medullary cones by reducing the diluting effect of the descending limbs on the region of the interstitium where the collecting ducts are located; however, the effects on longer cones are unclear.

AB  - Sexual and natural selection pressures are thought to shape the characteristic wing patterns of butterfly species. Here we test whether sexual selection by female choice plays a role in the maintenance of the male wing pattern in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We perform one of the most extensive series of wing pattern manipulations in butterflies, dissecting every component of the 'bulls-eye' eyespot patterns in both ventral and dorsal wing surfaces of males to test the trait's appeal to females. We conclude that females select males on the basis of the size and brightness of the dorsal eyespot's ultraviolet reflecting pupils. Pupil absence is strongly selected against, as are artificially enlarged pupils. Small to intermediate (normal sized) pupils seem to function equally well. This work contradicts earlier experiments that suggest that the size of dorsal eyespots plays a role in female choice and explains why male dorsal eyespots are very variable in size and often have indistinct rings of coloration, as the only feature under selection by females seems to be the central white pupil. We propose that sexual selection by female choice, rather than predator avoidance, may have been an important selective factor in the early stages of eyespot evolution in ancestral Lepidopteran lineages.

AB  - Several recent experimental studies have provided strong evidence for the ability of birds to manipulate the sex ratio of their offspring prior to laying. Using a captive population of peafowl (Pavo cristatus), we tested experimentally the effects of paternal attractiveness on offspring sex ratio, and related sex ratio deviations to egg-yolk concentrations of testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol and corticosterone. When females were mated to males whose attractiveness had been experimentally reduced by removing prominent eyespot feathers from their trains, they produced significantly more female offspring, had significantly higher yolk corticosterone concentrations and tended to have lower levels of yolk testosterone than when mated to the same males with their full complement of feathers. Concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol did not vary consistently with sex ratio biases. These findings add to the small number of studies providing experimental evidence that female birds can control the primary sex ratio of their offspring in response to paternal attractiveness, and highlight the possibility that corticosterone and perhaps testosterone are involved in the sex manipulation process in birds.

AB  - Eyespots are concentric motifs with contrasting colours on butterfly wings. Eyespots have intra- and interspecific visual signalling functions with adaptive and selective roles. We propose a reaction-diffusion model that accounts for eyespot development. The model considers two diffusive morphogens and three nondiffusive pigment precursors. The first morphogen is produced in the focus and determines the differentiation of the first eyespot ring. A second morphogen is then produced, modifying the chromatic properties of the wing background pigment precursor, inducing the differentiation of a second ring. The model simulates the general structural organization of eyespots, their phenotypic plasticity and seasonal variability, and predicts effects from microsurgical manipulations on pupal wings as reported in the literature.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is considered to provide a means of evaluating developmental stability and to reflect an individual's quality or the stress experienced during development. Stress is predicted to increase the phenotypic variation of both FA and trait size. In this study we examined the effect of a particular heat shock on both FA and size of eyespots in the butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. We also examined whether those eyespots thought to be involved in partner choice and sexual selection were particularly sensitive to stress. We applied a heat shock of 39.5degreesC for 3 h before, during, and after a sensitive period in eyespot development. We examined the FA, variation in FA, size, and variation in size of five eyespots, two on the dorsal forewing (sexually selected traits), two on the ventral forewing, and one on the ventral hindwing (nonsexually selected traits). For each sex and treatment, the heat shock did not result in significant changes in mean trait size and FA nor in the variation of size and FA. There were no differences in the response to the heat shock between sexually and nonsexually selected traits. We discuss how the increased production of heat shock proteins, including HSP60, may have stabilized development and how this might explain the results.

AB  - Understanding how the spectacular diversity of colour patterns on butterfly wings is shaped by natural selection, and how particular pattern elements are generated, has been the focus of both evolutionary and developmental biologists. The growing field of evolutionary developmental biology has now begun to provide a link between genetic variation and the phenotypes that are produced by developmental processes and that are sorted by natural selection. Butterfly wing patterns are set to become one of the few examples of morphological diversity to be studied successfully at many levels of biological organization, and thus to yield a more complete picture of adaptive morphological evolution.

AB  - Both local and regional habitat characteristics influence species richness and community structure. The scale at which communities are studied, however, affects the detection of relationships between habitat characteristics and patterns of habitat selection, species diversity, and species composition, and may obscure observation of differences in how species perceive the scale of environmental variation. To determine how environmental variation at different scales is related to species occurrence and richness, I analyze mist net sampling data on several guilds of forest understory birds. Bird capture, vegetation, and physical environment data come from 23 0.5-ha study sites in primary and secondary forest in Amazonian Ecuador. The percentages of primary forest within concentric circles around each site form forest imbeddedness measures (FIMs), which are evaluated using satellite imagery. Variation in FIM size represents different measurement scales for determining forest cover. Primary forest cover is also analyzed in successively larger tori surrounding sites and is used, after variable reduction with Principal Components Analysis, to summarize variation in forest cover around sites. Linear regression, surface trend analysis, and ordination help to quantify how variation in guild composition and species richness is explained by forest cover, vegetation structure, and physical environment.
   Species composition is related to variation in primary forest cover, primarily within 200-600 m of study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates that nectarivores, shrub-layer frugivores, and ant-following birds are captured in areas with relatively low primary forest cover. In contrast. shrub-layer insectivores, shrub-layer omnivores, and birds probing dead foliage for large insects tend to be captured in areas of relatively high primary forest cover. The species richness of insect gleaners, ant followers, and omnivores is statistically related to the percent cover of primary forest within hundreds of meters from the study sites. This suggests that some mechanisms that influence guild composition act over substantial distances. Nonetheless, the small radii of FIMs related to the species richness of dead-leaf probers suggests that local conditions and variation in forest cover over short (<200 m) distances directly or indirectly influence species richness of some primary forest birds. The significant relationship between temperature variation among capture sites and species richness of ant-following birds suggests that these species choose among habitats in a temperature range at which physiological constraints operate, either directly on the birds themselves or on the ants they follow. Species richness within the nectarivores, in contrast, shows no relationship with large-scale variation in primary forest cover.
   The radius of the FIM most closely associated with species richness differs among guilds, which suggests variation in the scale at which forest cover is associated with guild structure, as well as variation in the strength of the association. Differences in the scale of relationships between environment and species richness among guilds suggest that the mechanisms that influence both species' habitat use and community structure differ among guilds. A single mechanism, operating at a single scale, is inconsistent with these patterns. Independent data from eight additional sites suggest that prediction of species richness from surrounding forest structure could be useful for managing human impacts on tropical avian communities.

AB  - The tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to wet-dry seasonality. The wet season form (WSF) has a conspicuous wing pattern with large eyespots, whereas the dry season form (DSF) lacks eyespots and therefore has a more cryptic appearance. Temperature is the main factor controlling this difference: rearing larvae at a low (<19<degrees>C) temperature in the laboratory results in the DSF. whereas rearing at a high (>23 degreesC) temperature induces the WSF. We applied truncation selection in opposite directions in successive generations reared at two alternating temperatures (18.5 degreesC and 23.5 degreesC) to increase (for two High Plasticity (HP) lines), and decrease (for two Low Plasticity (LP) lines) wing pattern plasticity. Plasticity was assessed by partitioning full-sib families over four rearing temperatures (18.5 degreesC, 20.5 degreesC, 21.5 degreesC and 23.5 degreesC). Several wing pattern elements were measured for which the first principal component (PC1) provides a useful summary. The slopes of reaction norms for PC1 were significantly steeper in the HP lines than in the LP lines; however. the selection lines did not always differ significantly from the unselected stock. The results of crosses between the replicates of the selection lines gave no indication For effects or inbreeding. We argue that high. positive genetic correlations across temperatures retard a response to selection in opposite directions in different environments. This is discussed with respect to potential evolutionary constraints in natural populations in these butterflies.

The anterior end consists in a cap with a cylindrical extension and a globular structure. The flagellum has a 9+9+2 axoneme, two mitochondrial derivatives with paracrystalline matrices and an external coat formed by concentric layers. The eupyrene spermatozoa measure about 550 mum in length and are grouped into bundles. The anterior end consists in an amorphous globule, Posterior to this globule, a coat with a dense material covers the spermatozoon where an acrosome and a nucleus appear. The flagellum has a 9+9+2 axoneme and two mitochondrial derivatives. External to the coat and attached to the dense material, there is a reticular appendage, which has a paracrystalline core and extends to the distal tip of the spermatozoon.

AB  - A new spray chamber, termed a flushing spray chamber (FSC), has been developed for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry aimed at more rapid and reliable multi-element analyses of solution samples. The sample solutions are nebulised by a conventional concentric nebuliser and then directly aspirated into the glass chamber. A continuous flushing system within the glass chamber prevents long residence times of trapped sample droplets. The glass chamber used has single flow path configuration with smaller internal volume (about 50 epsilon mL) that avoids the stagnation of the sample aerosol inside the spray chamber. The combination of continuous washing and small stagnation times of the mist results in shorter washout time. Typical washout time for 1 mug g(-1) concentrations of U and Hg are about 40 s and 200 s, respectively, and these are about 1/4 and 1/100 of the level of the typical washout time observed with a conventional spray chamber including the Scott-type spray chamber. In the case of Os, because of a serious memory effect, the washout time for 1 mug g(-1) concentration of OsO4 solution could not be defined. Nevertheless, the washout time from 1 ng g(-1) concentration of OsO4 solution could be remarkably reduced, to 150 s, and this is almost two orders of magnitude shorter than the washout time achieved by the conventional spray chamber. When chilled water (about 4 degreesC) is used within the flushing system, stability, sensitivity and oxide level show no significant differences between the normal and modified nebuliser system. The data presented here demonstrate clearly that the practical measurement time can be shortened by means of the FSC developed in this study.

AB  - Adults of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana express striking phenotypic plasticity. A wet season form has conspicuous marginal eyespots and a medial pale band which are much reduced in the dry season form. These alternative forms are produced after rearing at high or low temperatures, respectively. We used 'window' experiments involving switching of larvae and pupae between high and low temperatures at different stages during development to examine the timing of sensitivity to environmental temperature. The final, fifth larval instar is shown to be especially sensitive. The fourth larval instar and the very early pupal period are also sensitive. It is argued that an increasing sensitivity during growth is ecologically adaptive since the late larval environment will be the most accurate predictor for the adult environment in which the wing phenotype is subject to selection. The period of sensitivity is not as short as a few days. This may minimize the chance of any 'mistakes in matching the adult phenotype to the season because of short-term environmental fluctuations during the larval period. The observed sensitivity occurs as late as possible during growth since the wing pattern is developmentally determined at the end of the early part of the pupal stage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Wood degradation by the white-rot basidiomycete Meripilus giganteus (Pers.:Pers.) Karst. was studied in naturally infected and artificially inoculated wood of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.). Semi-thin sections revealed that the secondary walls of most fibres contained internal cavities. Three distinct types of cavity formation, which differed not only between hosts, but also between cell type and location in the annual ring, were identified.
   Within discoloured wood of naturally infected beech, the structure of the cavities and their formation by the associated hyphae were reminiscent of a soft-rot. By contrast, cavity formation in artificially inoculated beech and large-leaved lime wood differed from a soft-rot mode of attack as extensive delignification always preceded cavity formation, and neither T-branching, L-bending, nor hyphal growth were found within cell walls. The formation of half-moon shaped cavities in beech wood was present only in tension-wood fibres. From large diameter hyphae, growing within the fibre lumen, numerous fine perforation hyphae extended transversely via helical cracks into the cell wall. Subsequent degradation of cellulose within concentric layers of the tension-wood fibres commenced from the apices of perforation hypha.
   Sections stained with ruthenium red and hydroxlamine-ferric chloride, revealed that M. giganteus preferentially degrades pectin-rich regions of the middle lamellae in xylary ray cells. In large-leaved lime, such regions were uniformly located in the middle lamellae of axial and ray parenchyma. In beech wood, degradation of pectin-rich middle lamellae regions commenced after the delignification of secondary walls and resulted in a conspicuous hollowing of multiseriate xylem rays. Plasticity in wood degradation modes by M. giganteus in large-leaved lime and beech wood reflects variations in cell wall structure and/or prevailing wood conditions.

AB  - The tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, exhibits seasonal polyphenism. The wet season form has large eyespots and a pale band while these characters are much less conspicuous or absent in the dry season form. This plasticity is induced in the laboratory by use of a standard series of constant temperatures in the larval stage yielding a continuous norm of reaction. Butterflies in this study were reared from hatchling larvae in seven regimes which differed with respect to thermoperiod or photoperiod. The effect of rearing treatment on the phenotypic plasticity of the adult wing pattern, on life history traits and on larval feeding rhythms was investigated. Photoperiod had little effect except that constant light produced a higher mortality and tended to produce a longer development time. Thermoperiod had a major effect on the life history traits in comparison to a constant temperature regime with the same daily mean: development time was shorter with higher growth rates. The faster development was associated with a substantial shift in the wing pattern towards the wet season form. Larvae feed mostly at night both under constant and thermoperiod (cool nights) conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the necessity of matching field and laboratory environments in studies of norms of reaction or of life history traits where the adaptive significance of the variation is important. Fluctuating conditions in nature, especially with respect to thermoperiod, must be taken into account.

AB  - The effectiveness of two types of eyespot balloons at causing avoidance by birds was examined in a flight cage using three captive doves, Streptopelia orientalis. A field where soybean seeds were systematically placed was divided into several plots in which the following three treatments were applied: placing of balloons with and without eyespots and no placing of balloons. The effectiveness of balloons was compared in terms of preference for the plots, calculated by measuring the number of beans eaten. Doves showed a tendency to avoid plots that had balloons. However, the intensity of avoidance differed between balloons with and without eyespots only in the first experiment, although the differences were not significant. That is, the scaring effectiveness of eyespot patterns is not very strong, and becomes extinct rapidly. These results suggest that the scaring effectiveness of eyespot balloons is mainly due to the curious stimulus of balloons rather than to the eyespot patterns themselves.

AB  - The performance of concentrically braced steel frames and moment resisting steel frames during the January 17, 1994, Northridge, California, earthquake is examined. Most of the observations made during the reconnaissance visits confirmed the current knowledge on the inelastic response of these structural systems. This permits the anticipation of proper seismic behavior for buildings designed according to the seismic provisions that have been recently introduced in the Canadian building code and standard for steel structures. In some cases, however, the observed damage raised concerns that should be addressed in future investigations or next editions of these codes. Preventing potentially hazardous nonstructural damage, avoiding premature nonductile failures anywhere along the lateral load paths, limiting structural and nonstructural damage due to brace buckling, and accounting for the vertical ground motion are among those issues.

AB  - Phenotypic variation in the wing underside eyespot elements and size variation in female forewing length were analysed in three Australian butterflies of the tropical genus Mycalesis Hubner over 2 years at Cardwell (18 degrees 16'S), north-eastern Queensland. Variation in spot size is strongly seasonal with distinctive wet-season and dry-season forms. Adult females of all three species are characterised by smaller ocelli during the dry cooler winter, whereas individuals with larger ocelli predominated throughout the wet hotter summer-autumn months. Phenotypic change is less pronounced and more gradual in M. sirius, and most dramatic in M. perseus with the dry-season form also lacking the conspicuous wing underside lines and bands. Dry-season forms are typically larger (at least in M. perseus and M. terminus), less active, aggregate in moist refugia and often reproductively dormant during the dry season. Wet-season forms usually reproduce directly and rarely diapause or aggregate. Seasonal polyphenism in these satyrines may be a dry season survival strategy, minimising risk of predation through crypsis during the period when females diapause and aggregate.

AB  - 1. For three successive years Bicyclus butterflies were caught on a daily basis at a field site in Malawi.
   2. Over 5000 butterflies, belonging to five species, were captured.  Eight characters describing their plastic wing pattern were measured and analyzed.
   3. Broadly speaking, the plasticity is similar for all species, with the wet season forms having conspicuous wing markings (e.g. eyespots), and dry season forms lacking these markings.
   4. However, at a more detailed level, each species has its own specific form of plasticity with especially clear differences in the number of intermediate forms.
   5. Females generally show a higher degree of plasticity than males.
   6. The relative frequencies of intermediate forms and the difference between the sexes are associated with differences between the species in their preference for more open habitats or forests.
   7. The species with the most divergent plasticity is also ecologically and phylogenetically comparatively distant from the others.

AB  - Well-preserved scaphitid ammonites from the type area of the Upper Cretaceous Fox Hills Formation in north-central South Dakota are the primary focus of this study; also included are scaphites from the uppermost Pierre Shale in this area and from the Fox Hills Formation in the Lance Creek-Red Bird area of eastern Wyoming. The Fox Hills beds represent the marginal marine phase of the progradational sequence marking the final withdrawal of the Cretaceous sea from the Western Interior. Within this marine sequence, which lies above the Baculites clinolobatus Range Zone, the following three range zones based on scaphites are recognized: Jeletzkytes nebrascensis Range Zone Hoploscaphites nicolletii Range Zone Hoploscaphites birkelundi Range Zone Based on recent correlation studies using macro- and microfossils, the H. nicolletii and J. nebrascensis zones equate with the lower Upper Maastrichtian of the European boreal province; the H. birkelundi Zone is either uppermost Lower Maastrichtian or possibly lowermost Upper Maastrichtian.
   More than 2500 adults and several hundred juveniles were examined in this study. These specimens fall into three genera: Hoploscaphites Nowak, 191 1, Jeletzkytes Riccardi, 1983, and Discoscaphites Meek, 1876. Hoploscaphites includes H. nicolletii (Morton, 1842), H. comprimus (Owen, 1852), H. melloi, n. sp., and H. birkelundi, n. sp. This genus consists of compressed shells with or without ventrolateral tubercles, and less commonly, umbilical tubercles or bullae. Jeletzkytes includes J. spedeni, n. sp., J. nebrascensis (Owen, 1852), and J. dorfi n. sp. and is characterized by medium to large shells with conspicuous ventrolateral and umbilicolateral tubercles. Discoscaphites includes D. conradi (Morton, 1834), D. gulosus(Morton, 1834), and a micromorphic species, D. rossi, n. sp. This genus consists of small to medium shells with multiple rows of tubercles. A cladistic analysis using the genus Scaphites Parkinson, 181 1 as an outgroup indicates that Hoploscaphites and Jeletzkytes are more closely related to each other than either is to Discoscaphites.
   The excellent preservation of these scaphites permits study of their ontogeny. The embryonic shell or ammonitella is approximately 700 mum in diameter and exhibits a tuberculate micro-ornamentation. The ammonitella is spheroidal in Hoploscaphites and Jeletzkytes and ellipsoidal in Discoscaphites. The juvenile shell is closely coiled and expands gradually in whorl width and whorl height. There is a slight change at approximately 5 mm shell diameter, coincident with the first appearance of ornament in the form of ribs. Ventrolateral tubercles appear as early as 10-15 mm shell diameter followed by the development of flank tubercles in species of Discoscaphites and Jeletzkytes. Rows of flank tubercles develop in succession from the ventrolateral margin toward the umbilicus. The angular length of the juvenile body chamber averages approximately 240-degrees.
   The mature shell is not as tightly coiled as that of the juvenile. The body chamber consists of an elongate shaft and recurved hook terminating in a constricted aperture. The change in the shape of the body chamber coincides with a change in the pattern of ornamentation. Large ventrolateral tubercles occur on the shaft in species of Jeletzkytes and in some species of Hoploscaphites. Muscle attachment areas on the body chamber are indicated by thin layers of myostracum preserved on steinkerns.
   All species are strongly dimorphic at maturity. The average size of macroconchs is significantly larger than that of microconchs, but dimorphs are primarily distinguished on the basis of shape. The body chamber of macroconchs increases abruptly in height, resulting in a nearly straight umbilical shoulder and a relatively small umbilicus whereas the body chamber of microconchs expands only gradually in size; the umbilical shoulder parallels the curve of the venter and the umbilicus is relatively broad. Macroconchs tend to be more sharply differentiated morphologically between species than are microconchs. In species of Hoploscaphites and Discoscaphites, septal approximation occurs over more chambers and is more marked in macroconchs than in microconchs. Macroconchs are more abundant than microconchs in most species.
   Remains of upper and lower mandibles are associated with all three scaphite genera. The lower mandible is composed of paired, externally convex plates that lie opposite one another, their ventral commissure aligned along the plane of bilateral symmetry. The plates are chitinous with an outer layer of calcite. The upper mandible, which is composed only of chitin, is a single element with two vertical, winglike, lateral parts that converge anteriorly to form a beaklike structure. Like the plates of the lower mandible, wings of the upper mandible are ornamented with concentric ribs that follow finer growth lines. Commonly occurring with mandible remains are hollow chitinous structures consisting of an inverted cup-shaped base 2-5 mm in diameter from which two hornlike projections taper upward to sharp points. Their identification is uncertain but, based on their uniform shape, they may represent hooklike structures rather than radular elements.

AB  - Species diversity and composition of the assemblages of butterflies and day-active moths were studied using a belt transect method on a concentric raised bog in southeastern Finland. The species richness of the mire was lower than that of the adjacent mineral land. On a vegetational gradient across the mire, the highest number of species and individuals were found on the lagg and marginal slope. The fauna appeared very similar along separate mire transects, while the mineral land samples differed more distinctly from each other. Multivariate analyses grouped the study sites into open minerotrophic mires, open raised bogs, pine bogs, coniferous forests and mineral lands with clear-fellings. Similar analysis of vegetation divided the transect section more distinctly into mires and mineral lands. The composition of the species assemblages of Lepidoptera was mostly related to the structural characteristics of the mire, especially to the tree height, and to a lesser degree to the floristic characteristics of undergrowth. The floristically poor pine bogs near the forest-mire edge maintain a peculiar and diverse fauna of butterflies and moths.

AB  - 1.  Seasonal polyphenism is studied in a community of five African butterflies of the genus Bicyclus at the transition between a wet and a dry season from May to July.
   2.  Butterflies characterized by large eyespots and, especially in B.safitza (Hewitson), a pale band (the wet season form) are replaced over this period by butterflies lacking conspicuous wing markings (the dry season form, dsf).  The latter butterflies also tend to be larger, but more variable in size.  Butterflies of an intermediate phenotype are recruited over a comparatively short interim period.
   3.  This turnover coincides with a period of declining temperature and drying of the habitat, including the grasses on which larvae feed.  Butterflies are progressively more likely to rest on brown leaf litter rather than on green herbage.  4.  A relationship with temperature is supported by laboratory experiments with B.safitza and B.anynana (Butler) showing that increasingly extreme dsf butterflies develop with decreasing rearing temperature in the final larval instar.
   5.  Some differences in behaviour and activity were observed between the seasonal forms.  Butterflies of the dsf develop ovarian dormancy and fat bodies.  They can survive to reproduce at the beginning of the rains in November.
   6.  Capture-recapture experiments showed that the adult butterflies have a comparatively long life expectancy and are quite sedentary.
   7.  The results are discussed in relation to a hypothesis linking the polyphenism to seasonal changes in resting background and selection for crypsis.

Alpheus octocellatus sp. nov. appears to be morphologically closest to A. edwardsii, A. pareuchirus Coutiere, 1905, and A. leptochirus Coutiere, 1905, but can be distinguished from all of them by a combination of morphological characters, mainly involving the chelipeds, third maxilliped and pleonal sternites. The new species also has a highly diagnostic colour pattern, with four pairs of conspicuous eyespots distributed in a unique and peculiar pattern on the pleon.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine whether the nonhuman animal affinities described by the proposed psychometric construct of Animality might be distributed unequally across different kinds of animals. Thus, we explored how respondent Animality scores correlated with clade-specific self-reports of cognitive and emotional empathy toward specific animal categories. To do so, we applied the Concentric Circles Model, three concentric circles of nonhuman animal clades based on their figurative outwards distance from humanity: Kith and Kin Animals, including kith clades such as dogs and cats as well as kin clades such as primates; Domestic Animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, and goats; and Wild Animals, including catfish, carp, snakes, and spiders. Undergraduate participants from a Southwestern university completed a survey assessing their levels of Animality as well as their attitudes toward nonhuman animals from all three concentric circles. These data replicated the previously published hierarchical latent structure of Animality. The higher-order General Factor of Animality (GFA) loaded positively onto two lower-order factors: Attraction to Animals and Emotional Regard for Animals. The GFA was most highly positively correlated with Kith and Kin Animal Cognitive-Emotional Empathy, less highly correlated with Domestic Cognitive-Emotional Empathy, and least highly correlated with Wild Cognitive-Emotional Empathy; the GFA was also positively correlated with General Animal Harm Avoidance. In this sense, Animality seems to capture significant aspects of Clade-Specific Biophila in a manner consistent with the Concentric Circles Model.

AB  - Helical fibers represent of one of the most extraordinary objects in living organisms and have recently produced through a coaxial microfluidic spinning process. But the requirement of collection capillaries may limit scalable production because of blockage liability, structural rigidity and cumbersome fabrication of capillary. Structural vulnerability of helical fibers could also limit their practical applications, e.g., in fabric and as wearable devices. Herein for the first time we showed that helical fibers could be produced solely with a core steel needle with double concentric sleeves through a coaxial wet spinning process, without the requirement of microfluidic spinning capillary. They were encapsulated into protection microtubes in an unprecedented form of rifled microtubes with helical ribs. The presence of protection microtubes promote not only their mechanical prop-erties, but also structural endurance to various practical circumstances. These rifled microtubes could serve as endurable and sensitive wearable strain/stress sensors (up to-300% strain and-100 kPa stress) to monitor various human motions, without showing conspicuous performance decay even after >104 cycles of measure-ments. This study offers not only a facile and scalable pathway of producing helical fibers, but also an un-precedented platform of rifled microtubes as endurable and sensible sensors of strain and pressure.

AB  - Lunar floor-fractured craters are characterized by the occurrence of radial and concentric grabens, and while their formation mechanism was broadly studied in literature, the relationships between displacement and length of the faults, together with the fault growth, were never examined. We produced a semiautomated Python-based script able to analyze all the parameters required for this study: displacement, length, width of the grabens, and power law relationship between displacement and length. The results of our investigation, carried on in Komarov, Humboldt, and Atlas craters, showed a sublinear fault growth, suggesting that for some reason the increase in displacement is not linear with respect to length. This can result from the interplay of mechanical discontinuities related to the stratigraphy (which cause a vertical fault restriction, preventing the displacement from developing in depth), and to linkage phenomena. The D-max/L ratios that resulted from our analyses are higher than previously predicted for the Moon and appear more similar to the values observed on Earth. The slip distribution revealed different stages of fault interaction within the same crater, while the overall maturity of the grabens seems to be significantly high based on the observed symmetry of the grabens. Moreover, our code (public and accessible) can facilitate future works that aim to widen our knowledge about the lunar faults' growth, with all the implications that can improve our understanding of the faults' behavior.

AB  - A common pre-season injury prevention assessment conducted by professional football clubs is the hamstring-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio calculated by peak torque (PT). However, it is debatable whether players that present low pre-season H:Q ratios are more susceptible to further sustaining in-season hamstring strain injuries (HSI). Based upon retrospective data from a Brazilian Serie A football squad, a particular season came to our attention as ten out of seventeen (similar to 59%) professional male football players sustained HSI. Therefore, we examined the pre-season H:Q ratios of these players. H:Q conventional (CR) and functional (FR) ratios, and the respective knee extensor/flexor PT from the limbs of players further sustaining in-season HSI (injured players, IP) were compared to the proportional number of dominant/non-dominant limbs from uninjured players (UP) in the squad. FR and CR were similar to 18-22% lower (p < 0.01), whereas quadriceps concentric PT was similar to 25% greater for IP than UP (p = 0.002). Low scores of FR and CR were correlated (p < 0.01) with high levels of quadriceps concentric PT (r = -0.66 to -0.77). In conclusion, players who sustained in-season HSI had lower pre-season FR and CR compared to UP, which appears to be associated with higher levels of quadriceps concentric torque than hamstring concentric or eccentric torque.

AB  - I developed a novel image processing method inspired by wavelet transform that uses a concentric mother wavelet. This method can be used for noise filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, and other appli-cations and is effective for images with low spatial frequencies. When filtering small-sized images, setting masks for Fourier filtering is often difficult; however, the proposed method does not require mask setting, thus facili-tating filtering. In practice, many concentric mother wavelets of different frequencies are prepared in advance, and the cross-correlation between the input image and prepared wavelets is calculated. Reconstruction or image processing can be easily performed by combining the obtained results for each frequency. I believe that the present method can aid image processing related to material analysis.

AB  - The first fossil Typhlocybinae inclusions from Eocene Rovno amber are described and illustrated. They include two new monotypic genera of the extinct tribe Protodikraneurini, Retrorsotettix n. gen. with type species R. vlaskini n. sp. and Protoparallaxis n. gen. with type species P. clavatus n. sp. Also described and illustrated are two new monotypic genera of the extant tribe Dikraneurini, Eodikraneura n. gen. with type species E. obscura n. sp. and Rovnodikra n. gen. with type species Rovnodikra longipes n. sp. Retrorsotettix is the oldest leafhopper known to exhibit a false eyespot and false leg markings on the forewing, representing an early acquisition of a defensive strategy against visual predators. Appearance of a small insect with false eyespots in the Eocene fossil record may reflect increased pressure by visual predators, especially crown ornithuromorph insectivorous birds. Such birds and small insect prey with false eyespots remain unknown in the Cretaceous. Eodikraneura exhibits a unique condition of the hind wing venation in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are confluent for a short distance but then diverge before separately reaching the submarginal vein. This presumably represents a morphological transition between the Protodikraneurini, in which hind-wing radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely separate and connected by a radial-medial crossvein, and Dikraneurini, in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely confluent distally. A key to genera of Protodikraneurini is provided.UUID: http://zoobank.org/f15e6f80-9708-4f5e-89a3-705f9d340a77

AB  - Objective As s toxic hydrocarbon pollutant, oil spills can become oil slicks on the sea surface, which hinders the material exchange between water and air and poses a serious threat to marine ecological environments as well as the production and life of human beings. Investigation on how to realize early warning and continuous monitoring of pollutants in the early stage of oil spill accidents is of great significance to the protection of marine environments. The marine optical remote sensor is a powerful tool to realize continuous dynamic monitoring of large-area marine environments at different scales and levels. But the solar flare which is the main reason for the saturation and distortion of optical remote sensors brings inherent difficulties in improving information extraction of remote sensing. Some previous studies indicate that the solar flare possesses significant polarization characteristics under specific conditions, and polarization detection is an effective method for oil spill detection. However, under the influence of wind speed and direction, the real sea surface cannot be regarded as a smooth one, and the characteristics and states of oil spills are complex. In the 1950s, Charles Cox and Walter Munk put forward a famous Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model of rough sea surface after a long-term rigorous investigation, which conforms very well to the real state of the sea surface. In this paper, the Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model is employed to model the solar flare reflected by rough sea surface affected by wind speed and direction. With the polarization reflection parameter defined by Fresnel's law, this paper quantitatively simulates and studies the spatial distribution and related differences between the degree of linear polarization ( DOLP) of solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks with different refractive indexes under different incident and observation geometries, as well as different wind speed and direction on the sea surface. This paper hopes that the simulation results can facilitate the application of multi-angle polarization remote sensing technology for marine oil spill surveillance.
   Methods Firstly, with the polarization reflectance coefficients defined by Fresnel ' s law, the orthogonal polarization Fresnel reflectance R p and R s of the solar flare reflected by calm sea surface are obtained. According to Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model, the polarization bidirectional reflectance R glint-p and R glint-s of the solar flare reflected by rough sea surface are calculated based on R p and Rs. In the next step, on the basis of R glint-p and R glint-s, the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by different sea surface media with various refractive indexes on rough sea surface affected by different wind speed and direction is simulated with respect to any incident and observation geometry. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of DOLP differences between clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated, and the most sensitive polarization observation angle of oil slicks with different refractive indexes is obtained.
   Results and Discussions The wind speed is set at 5 m/s, with the incident zenith angle set as 15 degrees, 45 degrees, and 56 degrees, and the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated (Fig. 2). The contour of the DOLP of the solar flare is approximately a concentric circle, and the minimum of the DOLP is located at the position corresponding to the incident zenith angle within the incident principal plane. As the incident angle gets larger, the distance between the DOLP contour in the direction perpendicular to the incident principal plane is wider than that in the parallel direction, and the contour features an elliptic shape. According to a specific DOLP of the solar flare, within the incident principal plane, the increase in. s is equal to the decrease in.v. By making the solar incident angle. s is 45 degrees, this paper simulates the distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by oil slicks with three different refractive indexes (Fig. 3). It is shown that the variation rate of the DOLP value with the change in observation geometry is related to the refractive index of sea surface media. When a specific angle is changed in the observation geometry, as the refractive index of sea surface media increases, the variation of the DOLP value becomes slight. In order to improve the oil slick detection sensitivity, the optimum polarization detection area with the largest difference between the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated. When the incident zenith angle. s = 45 degrees, and the observation azimuth angle f v equals 0 degrees and 180 degrees or ranges from 90 degrees to 270 degrees, respectively, the DOLP variation curves with the observation zenith angle f v of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks are simulated and compared (Fig. 4). When the incident angle is big enough, as observation zenith angle increases, the DOLP curves of all media first increase and then decrease. In addition, no matter how. s changes, there is a negative linear correlation between. s and the observation zenith angle. vm corresponding to the most significant DOLP difference between the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks. That means the sum of. s and. vm is a fixed value, which is highly related to the refractive index of oil slicks.
   Conclusions In this paper, the spatial distribution of DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks are simulated under various incident and observation geometries based on Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model. The optimum polarization detection angle of oil slicks with different refractive indexes is determined. It is shown that the incident and observation geometry as well as the refractive index of sea surface media are the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare. Furthermore, a lower refractive index of the medium is often accompanied by a higher rate of variation of the DOLP of the solar flare with specific changes in the observation geometry. When the incident zenith angle reaches a certain value, it is possible to observe a positive- to-negative reversal of the difference between the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by seawater and oil slicks within a specific range of azimuth angles of the forward reflection area. For oil slicks with specific refractive indexes, the sum of the optimum polarization detection angle and the solar incident zenith angle is constant, which is closely related to the refractive index of the oil slicks. According to the simulation results, under specific incident and observation geometry, polarization detection can significantly improve the sensitivity of oil spill detection. Therefore, this paper is expected to provide support for the protection of marine environments.

AB  - A topology optimization method for the design of thermal cloak is proposed. The thermal scattering the-ory is introduced to pre-define the initial topology of the thermal invisible cloak as two layers to reduce the number of design variables. In bilayer concentric rings, insulating and high thermal conductivity ma-terials are used to mask heat flow and correct thermal properties. Topology optimization based on the CMA-ES strategy is applied to quickly obtain the best configuration of available materials. The influence of the thermal properties of the material on the optimal configuration and the deflection angle of the thermal flux at the boundary surface has been investigated. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the function of the optimal cloak with that of the ideal metamaterial and the single insulating layer. The results show that despite its simple structure, the bilayer scattering cloak exhibits excellent cloaking performance under different thermal boundary conditions. In this work, the perfect scattering elimination is achieved by adjusting the layer thickness ratio of the cloak with the initial defined struc-ture rather than seeking the optimal thermal conductivity of material, so as to avoid the problem of mismatch between the actual and ideal parameters. Compared to continuous optimization method, the pre-defined bilayer structure is easy to manufacture. Our scheme introduces thermal scattering theory to pre-set the initial structure of the topology optimization method, which provides a general, convenient, and efficient means for the design and application of thermally functional materials.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Volleyball players are often subject to micro-traumatisms of the heel fat pad and ankle injuries. Recently, mat-based proprioceptive training has assumed a key role in recovery from these disorders. Therefore, this proof-of-principle study aimed to assess the efficacy of proprioceptive mat training on plantar pressures and athletic performance in volleyball players. The participants included adult semi-professional volleyball players allocated into two groups: an experimental group, with mat-based proprioceptive and balance training, and a control group, with a sham protocol. For the outcome, we evaluated the barefoot plantar pressure, performing an analysis on a baropodometric resistive platform. The countermovement jump and squat jump were measured using an inertial measurement unit. Nineteen subjects were included in the two groups: the active proprioceptive group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 9). The results show a more uniform redistribution of loads with pressure hindfoot relief in the experimental group compared to the control group (p = 0.021, RBC = 0.67). Moreover, we observed a significant increase in peak landing force and high concentric power development in the experimental group compared to the controls. Focused proprioceptive management provided hindfoot load attenuation by stimulating higher peaks of concentric force in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Even though the study included a small sample, the results obtained in this proof-of-principle study suggest a positive role of proprioceptive stimulation in the inter-seasonal scenario for volleyball players to improve their jump performance and reduce the micro-traumatisms of the heel fat pad and the ankle injury rate. However, further studies performed on larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

AB  - Background: Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) induces heightened ethanol intake at adolescence in preclinical studies. Ethanol intake alters the absorption of folate, a methyl-group donor critical for numerous cellular functions. The prenatal administration of folate is, therefore, a promising approach to reduce the effects of PEE.Objectives: Experiment 1 determined if prenatal folate modulated the effects of PEE on ethanol intake, anxiety-like response, and exploratory behaviors (Experiment 1) in Wistar rats. Experiment 2 assessed, in rats not given PEE, if postnatal folate reversed effects of ethanol exposure at postnatal days 28-42. Experiment 3 assessed if folate altered blood ethanol levels (BELs).Methods: Experiment 1 involved 242 (125 male) adolescent Wistar rats derived from dams given folate (20 mg/kg, gestational days - GD- 13-20) + ethanol (2.0 g/kg, GD 17-20), ethanol, or vehicle only at pregnancy. Experiment 2 involved 29 male adolescents administered vehicle or ethanol doses co-administered or not with folate. In Experiment 3 twelve adult females were tested for BELs after folate administration. These tests were applied: intake tests, light dark box (LDB), elevated plus maze, open field and concentric square field.Results: PEE heightened ethanol intake (eta(2) ps = 0.06-07) and induced hyperactivity and a reduced latency to exit the white area of the LDB (eta(2) ps = 0.12-17). These effects were partially inhibited by folate (p > .05). Rats exposed to ethanol exposure at adolescence exhibited reduced motor activity (eta(2) p = .17), regardless of folate treatment. Folate did not affect BELs.Conclusion: Folate administration should be considered as a preventive or acute treatment to attenuate the neurobehavioral effects of PEE.

AB  - Cloaking is typically reciprocal. Here, we introduce the concept of transmittable nonreciprocal cloak-ing, whereby the cloaking system operates as a standard omnidirectional cloak for external illumination but can transmit light from its center outward at will. We demonstrate a specific implementation of such cloaking that consists of a set of concentric bianisotropic metasurfaces, the innermost element of which is nonreciprocal and designed to simultaneously block inward waves and pass-either omnidirectionally or directionally-outward waves. Such cloaking represents a fundamental diversification of conventional cloaking and may find applications in areas such as stealth, blockage avoidance, illusion, and cooling.

AB  - In fused filament fabrication (FFF), it is important to control the extrusion process for different materials and extruder hardware precisely. The effective extrusion force on the nozzle allows the characterization of the flow behaviour of the molten polymer. Therefore, integrating compact force sensors into the extrusion unit allows the identification of suitable process windows for different materials and the evaluation of hardware. However, actual setups are not compact and restriction-free. This paper presents a new compact and concentric setup, which allows an accurate measurement of the forces in the extruder avoiding parasitic effects. Furthermore, the test rig and the calibration process including influencing factors such as filament contact force and extrusion height is described. On this basis, a varying parameter study using different nozzles, feeding velocities, and temperatures is conducted. The recorded values of the extrusion force are compared with the literature values and the flow behaviour is assigned to the corresponding nozzle geometry. It has been shown that the calibrated test rig is able to measure the extrusion force with sufficient accuracy. These measurements correspond to comparable literature values. The boundary conditions of feeding velocity for processing a specific material and nozzle are determined. In this way, requirements such as the fastest or a uniform extrusion can be specifically served by varying the corresponding parameters. An evaluation of the effects in the nozzles results in a nozzle performance overview.

AB  - This paper gives, in the limit of large Froude number, a closed-form, analytical solution for steady, two-dimensional, inviscid, free-surface attached flow over a submerged planar hydrofoil for arbitrary angles of attack and depths of submergence. The doubly connected flow domain is conformally mapped to a concentric annulus in an auxiliary plane. The complex flow potential and its derivative, the complex velocity, are obtained in the auxiliary plane by considering their form at known special points in the flow, and the required conformal mapping is determined by explicit integration. The four real solution parameters are determined as the simultaneous roots of four real nonlinear algebraic equations arising from the flow normalisation. The explicit form allows accurate evaluation of various flow quantities, including the lift on the foil, and these are related to the large-Froude-number results in recent numerical solutions.

AB  - Flywheel resistance training devices (FRTD) is shown effective in improving strength, sprinting, jumping and changes of direction (COD) performance in male soccer players, however, this is not elucidated in female soccer players. We aimed to assess the effect of FRTD on these physical abilities in females soccer players. 24 professional female soccer players (age: 20.4 +/- 2.6 years) were randomly assigned to a flywheel training group (FWTG) that trained twice a week for 6 weeks on a rotary inertia device with an initial volume of 3 sets of 6 repetitions and an inertia of 0,025 kg center dot m-2, increasing intensity and volume or a control group (CG) that did not performed any additional resistance training program. Concentric peak torque of the knee extensors (CONEXT) and flexors (CONFLEX), eccentric peak torque of the knee extensors (ECCEXT) and flexors (ECCFLEX) at 600 center dot s-1 on an isokinetic dynamometer, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, COD and 30-metres sprint were assessed. Significant time by group interactions were found in CONEXT (p = 0.002; r2p = 0.425), CONFLEX (p = 0.037; r2p = 0.22), ECCEXT (p = 0.002; r2p = 0.43) and ECCFLEX (p = 0.008; r2p = 0.334). No time by group effect was found in CMJ (p = 0.061; r2p = 0.182), COD (p = 0.067; r2p = 0.184) or sprint (p = 0.926; r2p = 4.979 center dot e-4). In conclusion, 6 weeks of flywheel squat training improved strength (especially eccentric strength) but not soccer -specific abilities such as jumping, changing of direction or sprinting in professional soccer players.

AB  - Introduction: Joint strength of the lower limbs plays a decisive role in the competitive ability of long jumpers. Special strength training based on science and targeted at the strength of the lower limb joints is an essential topic for long jumpers. Objective: To analyze isokinetic muscle strength characteristics of lower limb joints in long jumpers. Methods: Voluntary jumpers were submitted to isokinetic concentric contraction tests of the lower limbs and hip joints. We also analyzed the effect of strength training on lower limb joint injury. Results: The knee muscles of the athletes have reduced eccentric contractility. The ankle of the athlete has the most vulnerable joint to injuries in the sport. Conclusion: The explosive force and eccentric contractility of long jumpers??? lower limb extensor muscles have the most significant impact on joint thrust and extension speed. Athletes need muscle strength training to develop isokinetic muscle strength. This can effectively prevent injury to lower extremity joint movements. The research findings of this paper can provide a specific theoretical basis for formulating scientific training for long jumpers.

AB  - Purpose Elastic knee sleeves are often worn following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The study aimed to define immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on ground reaction forces (GRF) and knee joint power during a step-down hop task. Methods Using a cross-over design, we estimated GRF and knee kinematics and kinetics during a step-down hop for 30 participants following ACL reconstruction (median 16 months post-surgery) with and without wearing a knee sleeve. In a subsequent randomised clinical trial, participants in the 'Sleeve Group' (n = 9) wore the sleeve for 6 weeks at least 1 hour daily, while a 'Control Group' (n = 9) did not wear the sleeve. We compared the following outcomes using statistical parametric mapping (SPM): (1) GRF and knee joint power trajectories between three conditions at baseline (uninjured side, unsleeved injured and sleeved injured side); (2) GRF and knee joint power trajectories within-participant changes from baseline to follow-up between groups. We also compared discrete peak GRFs and power, rate of (vertical) force development, and mean knee joint power in the first 5% of stance phase. Results SPM showed no differences for GRF for the (unsleeved) injured compared to the uninjured sides; when wearing the sleeve, injured side mean power in the first 5% of stance increased significantly from a concentric to an eccentric power. Discrete variables showed lower peak anterior (propulsive) GRF, mean power in the first 5% of stance, peak eccentric and concentric power for the injured compared to the uninjured sides. After six weeks, a directional change for vertical GRF differed showed slightly decreased forces for the Control Group and increased forces for the Sleeve Group. Conclusion Wearing a knee sleeve on the anterior cruciate ligament injured knee improved knee power during the first 5% of stance during the step-down hop. No consistent changes were observed for ground reaction forces for SPM and discrete variable analyses. Wearing the knee sleeve at least one hour daily for 6-weeks lead to a directional change of increased vertical GRF for the Sleeve Group at follow-up.

AB  - Background: Handball is a sport with a high number of severe injuries.The shoulder is one of the most commonly injured joints, with an average prevalence of 17-41%. Objective: The primary aim is to identify the most significant risk factors related to shoulder injuries in handball. The secondary aim is to propose recommendations based on the available evidence concerning potential injury prevention strategies. Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Proquest, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus were undertaken for peer reviewed articles published between 15 July 1995 and 15 July 2019. The same search strategy was repeated on 24 April 2022. Prospective cohort studies, written in English and published in a journal with a peer-review process aiming to investigate at least one modifiable or/and a non-modifiable potential risk factor for shoulder injuries, specifically in handball players, were included. Only papers published after 1995 were included. The methodological quality of the eligible studies was assessed using the modified version of the Downs and Black Checklist. The Best Evidence Synthesis (BES) approach was used for synthesizing and reporting the results. Results: 1849 studies were identified, of which 8 were included. A total of 2536 (males = 1354, females = 1182) participants of which 2522 were handball athletes, were included. Four of the eight studies were rated as high methodological quality studies (> 85%) while the rest were rated as medium (50-85%). The risk factors for shoulder injuries in handball identified in the studies were strength imbalances (n = 6), glenohumeral range of motion (ROM) imbalances (n = 5), scapular dyskinesis (n = 5), incorrect dosage of training load (n = 2), previous injury (n = 1), sex (n = 2), player's position, school grade, playing level (n = 1), altered shoulder joint position sense (n = 1). Conclusion: Overall, from all the risk factors evaluated, there was strong evidence that the weakness of the shoulder external rotator muscles and the female sex increase the probability of shoulder injury in handball athletes. Nevertheless, the evidence for the other risk factors was moderate due to the methodological quality and the limited number of studies.

Participants were assessed for CMJperformance changes before, immediately after (0 h), 12 h after, and 24 h after judo training (JT) using unloaded CMJ(CMJ(unloaded)) and loaded CMJ(CMJ(loaded)). All the jumps were performed on a force plate, and the force-time curves were collected for further analysis. Respondents' perceptions were evaluated using the modified rating of perceived exertion (mRPE) before, after (0 h), 12 h, and 24 h after JT. CMJparameters were analyzed at four measured points using a one-way repeated analysis of variance. Effect sizes (ES) and percentage changes before versus 24 h after JT were calculated for comparison. Associations between the CMJparameters and mRPE were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation. The ratio of flight time to contact time significantly decreased, whereas the eccentric duration, concentric duration, and total duration significantly increased (p < 0.05) in both CMJs 24 h after JT. Compared with CMJ(unloaded), CMJ(loaded) had a significantly lower (p < 0.05) flight time, jump height, peak velocity, and peak power. The mRPE and CMJ(loaded) peak velocity showed moderate- to high-level negative correlation results both 0 and 24 h after training (r = -0.543, p < 0.05; r = -0.479, p < 0.05). In this study, we only observed the effect of fatigue on the neuromuscular (NM) system 24 h after JT. CMJ(loaded) height may help to better determine fatigue state compared with CMJ(unloaded). According to the results, the neuromuscular effects of fatigue were not observed until 24 h after a single high-intensity training. Therefore, when arranging high-intensity special training or strength and conditioning training, one should reduce the volume of training appropriately to avoid fatigue accumulation and reduce the risk of sports injuries.

AB  - Context: Overhead athletes place tremendous demands on the shoulder complex, which result in adaptive kinematics but potential susceptibility to injury. This study aimed to compare shoulder glenohumeral range of motion (ROM) and rotator muscles strength in bilateral and unilateral overhead sports. Design: Cross-sectional study; secondary care. Methods: Forty-two elite athletes (17.7 [4.5] y; 42.9% female), including 18 swimmers and 24 badminton players, were included. Preseason glenohumeral rotation ROM and isokinetic shoulder internal and external rotator muscles strength was tested (60 degrees center dot s(-1)). Bilateral (nondominant:dominant) and agonist:antagonist (external rotator:internal rotator) conventional and functional deceleration ratios (eccentric to concentric) were calculated. The impact of sport and number of competitive years on shoulder ROM and strength was tested. Results: Badminton players had greater glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, total ROM deficit, and lower bilateral strength ratio than swimmers (P <.050). Rotational strength was positively associated with the competitive years, but greater in swimmers (P <.050) and on the internal rotator (P <.001). The functional deceleration ratio was negatively associated with the competitive years on the dominant side in swimmers and for both sides in badminton. Conclusions: Unilateral overhead athletes had greater ROM and rotational strength asymmetries than bilateral athletes. Interestingly, the functional deceleration ratio was lower over time on the dominant shoulder for both sports, but, surprisingly, also on the nondominant shoulder in badminton, potentially creating a greater risk for shoulder injuries.

AB  - This article introduces a novel method to calculate the structural sensitivity in non-linear flows. The method is completely data-driven and only uses direct solutions, avoiding the need to calculate the adjoint solution. Moreover, the method can be directly applied to calculate the structural sensitivity in three-dimensional flows. Depending on the nature and the complexity of the data analysed, the methodology presented to calculate this so-called non-linear structural sensitivity, uses dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) or higher order DMD to identify the global modes leading the flow dynamics. The performance of this novel technique has been tested in the two-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds number (Re) 50, 60, 85, 100, 130 and 160, the three-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Re = 280 and spanwise wavelength ???????????? = 1.67 and 6.99, in a Food and Drug and Administration nozzle at Re = 800 and in two-concentric jets with similar velocity ratio at Re = 1500. The results have been compared with the structural sensitivity predicted by the linear theory, finding some similarities and discrepancies between both methods. Nevertheless, the highest structural sensitivity regions identified by this novel algorithm are in good agreement with the literature, where the flow instabilities have been controlled using different mechanisms of passive flow control located in the regions predicted by the non-linear structural sensitivity calculated in this article.

AB  - While the development and manufacture of pandemic vaccines is a daunting task, the greatest challenge lies in how to deliver these vaccines to billions of people around the world. This requires an efficient strategy of deliveries, at constrained costs and deadlines. This paper proposes an exact analytical approach and operational strategy to the logistics of any pandemic vaccination efforts, applicable both to sparsely populated areas or deficient infrastructure, and to very dense urban fabrics where mobility is highly constrained. Our strategy consists in dividing the territory concerned into zones and districts in a concentric way. We opt for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to free ourselves from land constraints. This involves serving, from a logistics centre (central depot), any number n of vaccination centres, while optimizing costs and deadlines. We have determined all equivalent and optimal flight path plans for a fixed and optimal number of drones, which depend on domain D(d); d being the demand of vaccination centers. The analysis of the results led us to define what we will call the "degeneracy of domain D". All our results are expressed as a function of the parameter n.

AB  - Simple Summary Since originally being described for fruit flies in 1990, insect embryo cryopreservation protocols have been developed for several fly species and have been used to preserve several important fly species and strains. However, the development of similar protocols for other types of insects has not progressed as rapidly. For instance, only three species of moths have been successfully cryopreserved, and the technique has not been widely adopted for any of these species. This is mainly due to complications associated with the outer egg coatings surrounding the developing moth embryo, which are substantially different from what surrounds a fly embryo. To expand the usefulness of this technique for moths, we have developed a cryopreservation protocol for the sunflower moth, a key pest of cultivated sunflower in the southern Great Plains of the United States. Our final protocol resulted in 23% of embryos hatching after cryopreservation, with 60% surviving to the adult stage. While designing this protocol, we also developed a novel method to quantitatively assess the ability of water to leave the egg after treatments, which is critically important to successful cryopreservation. Embryos of the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst), were cryopreserved after modification to the method that was previously described for Pectinophora gossipiella. The workflow to develop the protocol consisted of methods to weaken the embryonic chorion followed by the application of various methods to disrupt the sub-chorionic wax layer. These steps were necessary to render the embryos permeable to water and cryoprotectants. Initially, the embryos were incubated at 21 degrees and 24 degrees C, and the development of the double pigment spots/eyespot and eclosion were tracked every two hours. The embryos at 24 degrees C showed eyespots as early as 30 h, while in the case of the embryos that were incubated at 21 degrees C, there was a developmental delay of approximately 20 h. The embryos at 24 degrees C showed peak eclosion between 55 and 70 h, and the embryos at 21 degrees C eclosed between 80 and 100 h of development. Estimating this range is crucial for the purposes of stage selection and treatment initiation for cryopreservation protocol development for the embryos. The control hatch percentage at either developmental temperature was >90%, and the sodium hypochloride, 2-propanol and alkane-based treatments reduced the embryo hatchability to <10%. Hence, a modified surfactant-hypochlorite mixture-was used to destabilize the chorion and solubilize the hydrophobic lipid layers. Water permeability assessments using the dye-uptake method show that polysorbate 80 in combination with sodium hypochlorite alone is capable of permeabilizing the embryo as efficiently as sequential hypochlorite-alkane treatments, but with significantly higher hatch rates. A vitrification medium consisting of ethane diol and trehalose was used to dehydrate and load the embryos with the cryoprotective agent. The median hatch rates after vitrification were 10%, and maximum was 23%.

AB  - Eccentric hamstring exercises reportedly prevent hamstring strain injury in the biceps femoris long head (BFlh). However, information on the favorable adaptive responses in the BFlh to eccentric hamstring exercises is limited. We aimed to examine the acute effect of maximal isokinetic eccentric knee flexion on passive BFlh stiffness as a potential risk factor for the hamstring strain injury using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Ten young participants randomly performed both tasks involving five consecutive repetitions of isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee flexion with maximal effort on different legs. Passive BFlh shear modulus was taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 s after each task. Passive BFlh shear modulus was significantly reduced at all time points after eccentric knee flexion, whereas there was no significant change in passive BFlh shear modulus after the concentric task. The present findings indicate that passive BFlh stiffness would reduce specifically after low-volume, slow-velocity eccentric knee flexion exercise. The findings may help provide practitioners with a basis to develop more effective exercise programs for preventing HSI.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB  - A concentric cylindrical cloak is showed here to achieve the acoustic cloaking phenomenon. The introduced structure consists of MNE layers and water in MNE substrate in the MHz frequency range. Due to avoiding the incoming acoustic waves by the shell, the object can be hidden inside the cylindrical area of any shape. In order to improve the quality of cloaking, we have optimized the desired shell by considering the manufacturing technology. We show that an optimized, acoustic cloak based on composite lattice structure can reduce the scattering of an object more than a 20-layer realization of acoustic cloak based on multilayer cylindrical structure. This design approach can substantially simplify the fabrication of cloaking shells. In this research, to study the acoustic distribution of the desired structure, finite element method (FEM) has been used to analyze the structure in two dimensions and a cloak of natural materials with isotropic properties has been designed using effective medium theory.

AB  - This paper explores the use of sliding friction dampers (SFDs) as dissipative floor connectors to mitigate higher mode effects and earthquake-induced absolute acceleration demands on steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings. The dampers connect each floor of the steel CBF system to the diaphragms of the gravity framing system (GFS) and they allow for a relative in-plane movement between the two systems. For this purpose, a design methodology is first proposed to define the activation forces in the SFDs so as to ensure damage-free seismic performance in the steel CBF and the diaphragms of the GFS. The efficiency of the design methodology is demonstrated through nonlinear response history analyses on a low- and high-ductility six-story steel CBF building. The simulation results suggest that (a) the determined activation forces of the SFDs are effective in mitigating higher mode effects and in preventing story drift concentrations regardless if capacity design is employed for the CBF system; (b) the absolute acceleration demands are reduced by approximately 50% relative to those in the rigid diaphragm counterpart. Similar reductions are achieved in the lateral drift demands of the GFS at seismic intensities with return periods of 475 and 2475 years. The reduction in the variability of seismic response, both in terms of absolute floor acceleration demands and story drift ratios (SDRs) in the CBF system, is noteworthy. Limitations as well as suggestions for future work are discussed.

AB  - Soil-borne fungal diseases are always a threat to wheat production. Developing molecular markers is helpful in early diagnosis and precautionary treatment of these diseases. In this study, a total of 42 Rhizoctonia isolates and 11 Fusarium isolates were obtained from 84 samples of diseased wheat plants collected from 11 locations in China. Rhizoctonia cerealis (Rc) and Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fpg) were the most abundant species in the majority of the sampling regions, accounting for 77.4% and 11.3% of the total isolates, respectively. Eight internal transcribed spacer (ITS) types of Rc were defined based on ITS sequencing identification, among which the ITS type I was the most predominant types isolated in all test regions. Based on the ITS sequences of all isolates, two specific markers were developed to distinguish Rc, Rhizoctonia solani (Rs) and three species of Fusarium at the DNA level. These markers were used to successfully detect 53 isolates of Rc, Rs and Fusarium collected in the study. Identification results by markers developed in this work were further confirmed by ITS sequencing. These markers could be used to detect the specific infective pathogen in diseased wheat seedlings or soil residues in fields, which would then be useful for early prevention and treatment of diseases sharp eyespot (SE) and Fusarium crown rot (FCR).

AB  - Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the most promising Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques. FDM technique is capable to print continuous fibre reinforced composite (CFRP). Both researchers and the industrial community are becoming interested in this area. In the present work, Kevlar fibre reinforced composite (KFRCP) was fabricated using Fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique. Onyx material is used as matrix material and continuous kevlar fibre as reinforcement. In this present work influence of the following parameters has been investigated: effect of an increase in kevlar fibre reinforcement starting from 0, 2 to 10 layers in a step-wise manner on tensile strength. An effect of change in kevlar fibre direction, as well as configuration (isotropic, concentric pattern) on tensile strength by fixing 10 layers of kevlar reinforcement. A tensile test was conducted on the specimen in compliance with ASTMD3039. Young's modulus and stress had been calculated based on experimental results. It was observed that the overall strength of KFRCP was twenty times more compared to virgin CFRP (only onyx). Kevlar fibre has the poorest wettability with the matrix. Poor wettability and lack of impregnation between fibre and matrix result in delamination. Furthermore, delamination with an increase in reinforcement in the FDM process is also discussed. The results obtained will aid designers to select appropriate fibre direction and orientation while developing FRCP parts to prevent delamination.

AB  - Aim: Sufficient strength and dynamic stability of the lower limbs are essential for improving punching force and preventing injury in amateur boxers. However, there are still no comprehensive reports on the isokinetic knee strength of boxers with different performance levels. The current study aimed to profile the isokinetic muscle strength of flexion and extension of the knee in boxers, as well as bilateral, unilateral, and functional ratios, and investigate the variation in these muscle strength characteristics associated with different performance levels. Methods: Boxers were divided in two performance groups, elite (five males and four females) and non-elite groups (five males and four females). Muscle strength of the knee was determined via an IsoMed2000 device. Parameters examined included peak torque of the hamstring (H) and quadriceps (Q) during concentric (con) and eccentric (ecc) contractions at low (60 & DEG;/S), medium (180 & DEG;/S), and high (240 & DEG;/S) speed and bilateral ratios (BLs), unilateral ratios (ULs), and functional ratios of dominant (D) and non-dominant limbs. Results: In all angular velocities, the peak torque of H and Q was stronger in the elite group than in the non-elite group. ULs were lower in the elite group than in the non-elite group in Hcon/Qcon at 180D (p < 0.01) and 180ND (p < 0.05) and in Hecc/Qecc at 60D, 180D (p < 0.05) and 240D (p < 0.01). The elite group had higher BLs than the non-elite group in Hcon at 60 & DEG;/S (p < 0.05) and Qcon at 180 & DEG;/S (p < 0.05). The non-elite group had a higher functional ratio than elite boxers in Hecc/Qcon at 180D and 240D (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Elite boxers had stronger knee strength in con and ecc contractions. All boxers had normal Hecc/Qecc and Hcon/Qecc. Hcon/Qcon and Hecc/Qcon were abnormal at lower angular velocity. Elite boxers had higher BLs and lower ULs, indicating that they are at a higher risk of injury.

AB  - Grounded in hedonic assumptions, evidence suggests that people tend to engage in activities they consider pleasurable and enjoyable, while trying to avoid pain and displeasure. This suggests that the dynamic between positive and negative affect can influence current behavior and the intentions to continue performing. Regarding resistance training (RT), research focusing on how to promote a better affective response is still scarce and much needed. Given existing limitations and theoretical suggestions, a RT program was developed and applied to recreational exercisers in a quasi-experimental design aiming to (1) explore the affective response dynamic through an assessment after the last set of each exercise; and (2) analyze possible differences of preference and tolerance profiles in affective variables (core affect and enjoyment). For that purpose, 43 participants (21 male and 22 female; M-age = 34.69 +/- 6.71 years; M-experience = 8.32 +/- 4.54 years; M-BMI = 24.26 +/- 2.64 kg/m(2)) accepted to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics, correlational, and group comparisons analyses were performed to provide evidence for proposed objectives. The present study showed that measures of affective valence/arousal applied immediately after a set represents a feasible and ecologically valid approach to tap core affect. Results presented evidence that recreationally trained exercisers in a common RT program would need a minimum of one measurement to assess the affective response. However, additional assessments could refine the understanding of exercise pleasurable experience. Results also suggest that exercisers with distinct profiles of preference/tolerance depicted differentiated patterns for the affective response, possibly justifying a distinct approach when promoting affective regulation.

AB  - This paper studied the incident of linear oblique waves to circular columns of offshore wind turbines in conjunction with concentric and non-concentric thin permeable cylinders. The unique research objective of this work is to assess the possibility of using permeable vertical cylinders to reduce wave forces on the column of offshore wind turbines. The developed semi-analytical method benefits from the mathematical relation between Bessel functions to express the BEM-related integrals in the Fourier modes of the Hankel function and to calculate singular integrals indirectly. Moreover, Graf's addition theorem for Bessel functions was used for shifting between different coordinate systems to avoid calculating related integrals numerically. The basic geometries parameters such as permeability parameter, cylinders arrangement and the radius of the permeable cylinders, and the wavenumber on the horizontal wave-induced force were studied. The results are presented in graphs. The results indicate that covering the columns of DeepCwind and OC3 wind turbines with the permeable cylinders or using the permeable cylinders upstream helps reduce the horizontal wave-induced force at a particular permeability parameter. The results of this research are beneficial in the design of columns of offshore wind turbines and other structures with vertical piles, such as semi-submersibles.

AB  - Purpose of review The role of perichondrium in cartilage graft survival has been long debated. Although the innate function of perichondrium in providing mechanical and regenerative support to cartilage in its native position is relatively undisputed, studies continue to vacillate over how the perichondrium effects cartilage grafts once transplanted. This review evaluates historical and recent experiments showing how perichondrium may or may not impact graft survival. Recent findings Experimental studies in animal models have more recently evaluated macroscopic and microscopic properties of diced cartilage grafts with and without perichondrium, finding that in general grafted cartilage with perichondrial components retains greater weight and mechanical strength compared with cartilage without perichondrial components. However, these findings have not been replicated in humans. Solid pieces of rib cartilage have most recently been used without perichondrium to prevent warping, though no studies have evaluated whether retaining perichondrium with oblique and concentric cutting techniques may effect overall resorption. Although historical opinions and more recent animal studies suggest a role of perichondrium in cartilage graft survival, randomized controlled human studies are still lacking on whether retaining perichondrium truly effects graft survival and ultimate surgical outcomes.

AB  - Purpose of Review Among the most common causes of cardiac syncope are arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease, both of which can coexist. The purpose of this review is to discuss the main causes of cardiac and vascular syncope related to atherosclerosis, its epidemiological and clinical aspects, warning signs, and initial approach. Recent Findings Cardiac syncope may have a frequency of up to 34% in elderly people. Atherosclerosis-related causes of cardiac and vascular syncope may be due to cardiac arrhythmia and/or structural impairment of the heart or arteries. Late ventricular tachycardia and late-onset high-grade atrioventricular block associated with myocardial ischemia may occur with syncope, which is related to higher mortality. Besides ventricular dysfunction, concentric remodeling is also a prognostic factor. In calcific degenerative aortic stenosis, syncope carries a worse prognosis than the other cardinal signs. Cardiac syncope has a high recurrence and mortality rate. There are red flag alerts that must be considered in risk stratification.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine strength asymmetries in elite athletes of different sports and (2) to examine the magnitude of asymmetries between elite and u18 athletes. Materials and Methods: A total of 254 athletes participated in this study. For the first purpose of the study, the group consisted of adult professional male basketball players (n = 30), elite male (n = 30) and female soccer players (n = 20), male futsal players (n = 30), elite male goalkeepers (n = 22), and professional female volleyball players (n = 20). For the second purpose, male youth goalkeepers (n = 22), youth female (n = 20) and male soccer players (n = 30), and youth male basketball players (n = 30) were compared to the adult athletes of the same sport. Asymmetries were measured utilizing a Humac Norm and Rehabilitation device. Testing included three maximal concentric flexion and extension repetitions at an angular speed of 60 degrees/s. The differences in asymmetries were assessed using ANOVA followed by an LS means post-hoc analysis. An independent samples t-test was used to identify the differences between adult and youth players. Results: It was indicated that none of the groups demonstrated asymmetries greater than 10%, other than the elite female soccer players and female volleyball players. Significant differences were demonstrated between youth and adult soccer players (males and females), with the adult groups demonstrating increased asymmetries. Conclusions: Special consideration should be given to female soccer players and volleyball players, as soccer and volleyball practice and competition at the professional level may induce greater lower -limb asymmetries. The isokinetic parameters can be useful for planning strength and conditioning interventions in order to reduce or prevent those imbalances. Additional unilateral and bilateral jumping testing is encouraged for the verification of imbalances.

AB  - This study analyzes the extent to which alarm systems impact geographical displacement and/or diffusion of benefits on burglary, which regards as a substitute for the absence of capable guardians. A quasi-experimental design with three nested concentric zones-target, buffer, and control-are utilized by incorporating the WDQ conceptual approach with GIS and a parcel map. The datasets include burglary incidents and alarm permit records. Alarms produce a sizeable impact on burglary reduction. No indication of spatial displacement is observed from protected houses to nearby houses. Alarms create a short geographic ambit and a wider spatial range of diffusion of benefits. A burglar alarm can protect the house without displacing burglary to nearby houses and provides neighboring houses with protection as well.

AB  - Butterfly wings play a crucial role during flight, but also in thermoregulation, intraspecific signal-ling and interaction with predators, all of which vary across different habitat types and may be reflected in wing morphology or colour pattern. We focused on the morphological variability of Erebia medusa in order to examine patterns and variations in the colouration and morphology of wings from areas representing different habitat types with different environmental characteristics. The barrier (larger fragments of forest) between populations of Erebia medusa along the elevation gradient of Kojsovskd hora might be the aspect that hinders the movement of the population. The wing characteristics (shape, size, spotting) of males representing popu-lations of Carpathian mountain habitats (Volovske vrchy, Ondavskd vrchovina) located at different elevations were measured. The forewing shape analysis, using geometric morphometry based on 16 landmarks, showed significant differences between populations from different elevation levels. The pattern of the forewings also varied between populations. Morphological changes among individuals of Erebia medusa populations along the elevation gradient in the Carpathian Mountains showed that in the cold, highland habitats we observed smaller, narrower and elongated forewings with a reduced number of spots, while males from warmer habitats at low elevations had rounder, larger and more spotted forewings.

AB  - We study the collective motion of autonomous mobile agents in a ringlike environment. The agents' dynamics are inspired by known laboratory experiments on the dynamics of locust swarms. In these experiments, locusts placed at arbitrary locations and initial orientations on a ring-shaped arena are observed to eventually all march in the same direction. In this work we ask whether, and how fast, a similar phenomenon occurs in a stochastic swarm of simple locust-inspired agents. The agents are randomly initiated as marching either clockwise or counterclockwise on a discretized, wide ring-shaped region, which we subdivide into k concentric tracks of length n. Collisions cause agents to change their direction of motion. To avoid this, agents may decide to switch tracks to merge with platoons of agents marching in their direction. We prove that such agents must eventually converge to a local consensus about their direction of motion, meaning that all agents on each narrow track must eventually march in the same direction. We give asymptotic bounds for the expected time it takes for such convergence or "stabilization" to occur, which depends on the number of agents, the length of the tracks, and the number of tracks. We show that when agents also have a small probability of "erratic", random track-jumping behavior, a global consensus on the direction of motion across all tracks will eventually be reached. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings in numerical simulations.

AB  - Eye gaze is an important source of information for animals, implicated in communication, cooperation, hunting and antipredator behaviour. Gaze perception and its cognitive underpinnings are much studied in primates, but the specific features that are used to estimate gaze can be difficult to isolate behaviourally. We photographed 13 laboratory-housed tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus [Cebus] apella) to quantify chromatic and achromatic contrasts between their iris, pupil, sclera and skin. We used colour vision models to quantify the degree to which capuchin eye gaze is discriminable to capuchins, their predators and their prey. We found that capuchins, regardless of their colour vision phenotype, as well as their predators, were capable of effectively discriminating capuchin gaze across ecologically relevant distances. Their prey, in contrast, were not capable of discriminating capuchin gaze, even under relatively ideal conditions. These results suggest that specific features of primate eyes can influence gaze perception, both within and across species.

AB  - Background: Bilateral symmetry evaluation in lower limb is used for injury prevention, and is an indicator of returning to post-injury activity. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of different angular velocities on asymmetry of the hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratio. Method: Isokinetic concentric hamstring to quadriceps (H:Q) peak torque ratio of the 27 male and female professional basketball players was measured at seven angular velocities (60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 180, 240, 300 deg s(-1)) on both dominant and non-dominant legs with Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of angular velocity and limb side on our outcomes (p < 0.05). Results: The results showed that with increasing angular velocity, the ratio of hamstrings to quadriceps increases (p = 0.001). There was no difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs in the H:Q peak torque ratio (p = 0.254). In addition, velocity of measurement did not affect the bilateral asymmetry of peak torque ratio of the H:Q of both sides (p = 0.852). Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that measurement velocity does not affect the bilateral asymmetry of the H:Q peak torque ratio of the dominant and non-dominant limbs. In clinical assessments of H:Q bilateral asymmetry, we suggest that physical trainer can assess bilateral asymmetry of H:Q with arbitrary angular velocities. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankle sprain is the most common acute time-loss injury in volleyball and occurs mainly during landing from a jump. Therefore, we have evaluated the role of quadriceps strength and countermovement jump height on ankle sprain occurrence, as these intrinsic modifiable risk factors were not yet evaluated. We have also hypothesized that presence of quadriceps strength asymmetry could be a possible risk factor for ankle sprains in male volleyball players. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Male volleyball players (N.=99) from Slovenian national league participated in the study. Before the start of the season, all participants completed a preseason questionnaire and underwent evaluation of vertical jump performance and bilateral isokinetic strength of the quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H). During the subsequent season the players reported acute time loss injuries because of ankle sprain through a weekly questionnaire. RESULTS: We have registered 19 ankle sprains during the season. Overall ankle sprain incidence was 0.41 +/- 0.24 per 1000 h. Previous ankle sprain (Odds Ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.25-2.89, P=0.802) and jump height (1.05; 95% CI: 0.94-1.19, P=0.393) were not significant risk factors, while Q strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of an ankle sprain (Odds Ratio: 0.956; 95% CI: 0.919-0.995, P=0.026). Compared with the uninjured players, the injured players had higher right concentric Q strength, higher Q strength asymmetry, and lower concentric right H-Q CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that excessive concentric strength of the right Q, which leads to low H-Q strength ratio, and high bilateral Q strength asymmetry in favor of the right side, could be associated with increased risk of ankle sprains in male volleyball. in male volleyball players.

AB  - While openings are an essential requirement in buildings as a source of access, fresh air and sunlight, these openings cause a reduction in the lateral stiffness and torsional resistance of masonry wall units. A detailed numerical investigation was carried out to explore the impact of the opening percentage on the in-plane stiffness and lateral strength of unconfined and confined masonry wall panels prepared using calcium silicate bricks, for sustainable masonry structures. A commercially available FEM package (ANSYS) was used to carry out comparative analysis of ten wall panels, five of each type (confined and unconfined masonry walls) with concentrically located openings of varying sizes (0% to 16.5%). A simplified micro-modeling technique following the Newton Raphson Algorithm was adopted. Results revealed that the confined masonry approach unveiled a more reliable anti-seismic response along with improved in-plane strength in the case of confined masonry walls. The failure type shifted from pure flexural to more of a blend of shear and flexure after the opening percentage increased to 10.09% in unconfined masonry walls, which was not the case where confinement was provided. Based on the outcomes, it is strongly recommended to adopt confined masonry in highly seismic-prone areas to avoid catastrophic damage caused by earthquakes.

AB  - Analyzing asymmetry from biomechanical parameters of the lower extremities has become a standard practice for accurate assessment of athletic performance, injury prevention, and rehabilitation. The aims of this study were (1) to determine differences between explosive strength and asymmetry of the lower extremities using kinetic parameters of the CMJ jump test in young female athletics, and (2) to investigate correlation between speed and asymmetry, as speed and kinetic parameters. The two groups of nine female sprinters (mean +/- SD; G1-age 15.6 +/- 1.34 years, height 170.1 +/- 0.57 cm, body mass 62.54 +/- 7.73 kg, and BMI 21.6 +/- 2.05; G2-age 16.2 +/- 1.3 years, height 168.4 +/- 0.61 cm, body mass 57.69 +/- 3.12 kg, and BMI 20.37 +/- 1.38) performed the CMJ test without using an arm swing, as well as a 100 m test. Two tensiometric platforms were used for the kinetic parameters and asymmetry. Asymmetry was calculated by an AI equation, and the values of the takeoff velocities and jump height parameters were obtained by integral formula and the trapezoidal rule of impulse-momentum methods. The results show differences in four kinetic parameters: height (G1- 26.82 +/- 3.56 cm, vs. G2- 17.45 +/- 2.01 cm), concentric impulse, (G1- 96.05 +/- 16.95 N center dot s, vs. G2- 68.41 +/- 4.77 N center dot s), takeoff velocity, (G1- 2.29 +/- 0.14 m/s, vs. 1.83 +/- 0.12 m/s), and concentric velocity, m/s (G1- 1.5 +/- 0.175 m/s, vs. 1.17 +/- 0.122 m/s), as well as a negative strong and very strong correlation between asymmetry and kinetic parameters for three parameters: Peak Force (G1- r = -0.878, and all subjects r = -0.633), Eccentric Impulse of left leg (G1- r = -0.865) and Concentric Impulse of right leg (G2- r = -0.878), (p <.05). The younger sprinters did not show the principle of muscle activation in the form of a longer preparatory phase of contact time, eccentric and concentric phase, as well as a force impulse that is optimal. There was no correlation between asymmetry and sprint performance.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how attitudes toward different nonhuman animal species (including emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and harm avoidance) are shaped by the coevolutionary histories between the ancestors of contemporary humans and these different nonhuman animal species. We compared the explanatory power of alternative categorization frameworks for classifying attitudes toward animals across several cross-cultural samples (Arizona, California, Costa Rica, Spain, and Mexico). Analytical Approach 1 directly compared two alternative frameworks. Adapa categories were generated as purely functional ones based upon the ecological niches occupied by each species within the biotic community generated by human-nonhuman animal relations, and Tuxtla categories were generated as cognitive ones based upon the degrees of consciousness commonly ascribed to the constituent species. Analytical Approach 2 tested the alternative hypothesis that both categories were part of a general scheme organized into three superordinate categories reflecting concentric circles around our own, consistent with fitness interdependence theory. Results supported this alternative hypothesis. The concentric circles model (Kith & Kin Animals, Domesticated Animals, and Wild Animals) better explained empathy and harm avoidance scores, suggesting that attitudes toward specific animal species are partly shaped by which circles they fall into, the product of the coevolutionary relationship shared between them and humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of different ankle strengthening training programs: eccentric, concentric, and resistance bands, on performance of university level sedentary males. METHODS: Sixty-three males between the ages of 18 and 26 years were randomized to either eccentric isokinetic (N.=21), concentric isokinetic (N.=21), and resistance bands ankle strengthening groups (N.=21). Training was performed three days a week, for eight weeks for both sides of ankle. Each program was made progressively harder by increasing the number of repetitions or sets. Measurements evaluating strength, balance and jumping performance were repeated pre, post and at one month (follow-up) after training. RESULTS: Statistical significance was observed for concentric evertor strength for both sides of the ankle for all groups after training (P<0.05). In addition, statistically significant increases were seen in jumping performance for all groups and dynamic balance for eccentric and concentric groups (P<0.05), with the concentric being statistically higher compared to the resistance bands group for all parameters (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ankle isokinetic strength (eccentric, concentric) training is more effective than resistance bands regarding improvement on strength, explosive strength, and dynamic balance. Ankle isokinetic strength training, which includes evertor and invertor muscles, improves performance, especially when applied concentrically. Therefore, the proper strengthening of ankle muscles will prevent the re-injury of ankles with individuals returning to activities.

AB  - The concentric cable-driven manipulator is becoming increasingly important in minimally invasive surgery. Obviously, one of the basic requirements is to track trajectory and avoid collision at the same time. However, the unavoidable difficulty is to choose an inverse kinematics solution that fits inside the confined environment from infinitely many solutions due to its redundancy. This article proposes a combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bezier curve for the concentric cable-driven manipulator tracking desired trajectory in confined 2-D and 3-D. First, the new proposed structure and the nomenclature are introduced. Then, the kinematic modeling of the concentric cable-driven manipulator in actuator space, configuration space, and task space is detailed. Thereafter, using the proposed biarc curve, the relationship between the end direction and bending angles is comprehensively analyzed. The Bezier curve is then adopted to plan the desired path for the concentric cable-driven manipulator moving in confined 2-D and 3-D environments. Finally, the proposed combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bezier curve is experimentally verified in a trajectory tracking task simulating a large intestine examination in both the typical "C" configuration (2-D environment) and the "S" configuration (3-D environment). The results prove that the combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bezier curve can be applied to generate a reasonable solution for concentric cable-driven manipulators that are confined both 2-D and 3-D environments.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important model organism in the study of the neurobiological basis of human mental disorders. Yet the utility of this species is limited by the quality of the phenotypical characterization tools available. Here, we present a complex testing environment for the quantification of explorative behavior in adult zebrafish, the zebrafish Multivariate Concentric Square Field (TM) (zMCSF), adapted from the rodent equivalent that has been used in > 40 studies. The apparatus consists of a central open area which is surrounded by a dark corner with a roof (DCR), corridors, and an inclined ramp. These areas differ in illumination, water depth, and are sheltered or exposed to different degrees. We quantified behavior of male and female wild-caught and AB strain zebrafish in the zMCSF (day 1) and cross-validated these results using the novel tank diving test (NTDT) (day 2). To assess the effect of repeated testing, AB zebrafish we tested a second time in both tests 1 week later (on days 7 and 8). We detected strong differences between the strains, with wild zebrafish swimming faster and spending more time in the corridors and on the ramp, while they avoided the open area in the center. AB zebrafish were less hesitant to enter the center but avoided the ramp, and often left one or more zones unexplored. No major sex differences in exploratory behavior were detected in either strain, except for a slightly higher velocity of AB males which has been reported before. Importantly, the zMCSF was largely resilient to repeated testing. The diving test revealed only one difference confined to one sex; wild females paid more visits to the top third than AB females. In isolation, this finding could lead to the conclusion that wild zebrafish are more risk-taking, which is incorrect given this strain's avoidance of open areas. To conclude, our results suggest that the zMCSF presents a sophisticated behavioral tool that can distinguish between different magnitudes and types of risk, allowing the user to create an intricate behavioral profile of individual adult zebrafish.

AB  - The causative role of inflammation in hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases is evident and calls for development of specific immunomodulatory therapies. We tested the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of action of developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1), an endogenous antiinflammatory factor, in angiotensin II-(ANGII-) and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced (DOCA-salt-induced) cardiovascular organ damage and hypertension. By using mice with endothelial overexpression of DEL-1 (EC-Del1 mice) and performing preventive and interventional studies by injecting recombinant DEL-1 in mice, we showed that DEL-1 improved endothelial function and abrogated aortic adventitial fibrosis, medial thickening, and loss of elastin. DEL-1 also protected the mice from cardiac concentric hypertrophy and interstitial and perivascular coronary fibrosis and improved left ventricular function and myocardial coronary perfusion. DEL-1 prevented aortic stiffness and abolished the progression of hypertension. Mechanistically, DEL-1 acted by inhibiting alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-dependent activation of pro-MMP2 in mice and in human isolated aorta. Moreover, DEL-1 stabilized alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-dependent CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg numbers and IL-10 levels, which were associated with decreased recruitment of inflammatory cells and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines in cardiovascular organs. The demonstrated effects and immune-modulating mechanisms of DEL-1 in abrogation of cardiovascular remodeling and progression of hypertension identify DEL-1 as a potential therapeutic factor.

AB  - The present work determines numerical solutions applied to flow problems in a cut-cell framework, introducing and evaluating two interpolation alternatives for the treatment of the convective terms and the effect of the variation of the number of slave cells generated near the solid interfaces. Using the upwind, QUICK and WAHYD (TVD) schemes, three benchmark cases were studied in the laminar regime, namely, flow between concentric cylindrical walls, flow in an inclined channel and flow around a cylinder. The numerical results obtained were favorable for the proposed interpolation methodology that prevents velocity over/under-estimations on the finite control volume faces, observing a tendency to produce smaller errors and mid-to-high computational efficiencies when coupled with a smaller number of slave cells generated at the boundaries. Although the magnitude of the errors found were small, improvements are of more significance for quantities that depend on gradient estimations at surfaces.

AB  - Fault diagnosis technique plays an important role in ensuring safety operations and preventing catastrophe for the rotating machinery. In the fault diagnosis framework, the entropy-based method becomes a promising tool for feature extraction. Among the entropy-based methods, the diversity entropy (DE) has arisen increasing attention due to its merits of high consistency, strong robustness, and high calculation efficiency. However, DE confronts the challenge of identifying fault types with different structures, which limits the broader application of DE in the practical engineering. Generally, when faults occur on different structures, the fault features distribute widely over the full frequency band and the main difference is the sideband around the characteristic frequency. Unfortunately, the Haar wavelet used in DE can hardly match all the oscillation pattern caused by different structures, resulting in deficient feature extraction. Hence, this paper presents a high flexible feature extraction method called concentric diversity entropy (CDE), which utilizes multiple wavelets to extract fault features over the full frequency band. Based on CDE, a diagnosis framework has been developed. At last, the simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms five entropy-based methods in identifying fault types with different structures.

AB  - Besides the optimisation of process parameters such as laser power or scan speed, the choice of the scan path represents a possibility to optimise the laser powder bed fusion process even further. The usual hatching strategy creates a homogeneous microstructure but makes it necessary to switch the laser off and on after each scan vector, which can slow down the fabrication. Moreover, the end of each scan vector is a location susceptible to the creation of keyhole pores. In this work, these disadvantages were meant to be avoided by using scan strategies that consist of longer paths and thus less end of track points. To this end, an open-source tool to tailor the LPBF G-code to geometric part features and advanced path configurations was developed and embedded into a co-visualization platform. With this tool, specimens built with four different types of paths were fabricated and the effect of these alternative scan strategies on pore distributions and path neighbourhood was investigated using micro-computed tomography. In the examined example geometry, a spiral scan pattern reduced the distance the laser had to jump between scanning by 78%. However, with the alternative path patterns, the defect architecture was strongly dependant on the part geometry and increased the overall porosity to 0.42%. Respective alleviation approaches are therefore necessary and are discussed in the remainder of this work.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify preseason isokinetic strength differences in the knee flexors and extensors and their ipsilateral/bilateral ratios and, furthermore, to compare the results among players who subsequently overcame a hamstring strain injury (HSI) or anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture during the season and those who did not. Materials and Methods: A total of 134 professional soccer players underwent isokinetic strength assessment at a velocity of 60 degrees center dot s(-1) (knee flexors and extensors) for the dominant and non-dominant lower limb to determine preseason peak torque values and bilateral and ipsilateral strength ratios. Subsequently, the incidence of injuries during the season was recorded, and players were divided into groups according to ACL rupture injuries (n = 10), hamstring strains (n = 10), and a control group of non-injured players who were selected on a random basis (n = 20). A retrospective approach was used to analyze and compare the preseason strength characteristics and whether some variance among groups was relevant among the injured leg and non-injured leg groups. Results: The results of our study show that low-angular velocity preseason testing did not result in a player's HSI or ACL injury during the season. The difference between the monitored groups ranged from 1.5% to 3%. The comparison showed low evidence for significant differences. Conclusions: An angular velocity of 60 degrees center dot s(-1) within concentric muscle contraction alone was not linked to subsequent injury of the hamstring or anterior cruciate ligament and acted as an insufficient factor of injury risk in adult professional soccer players.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Isokinetic strength has been useful to assess muscle function related to sports and prevent injuries. The present study measured the isokinetic isometric and concentric shoulder rotators strength, agonist/antagonist ratio, and examined the relationships between isometric and concentric peak torque, and agonist/antagonist ratio in powerlifters compared to a control group.
   METHODS: The participants were divided into two groups: powerlifters group (N.=14) and physically active group (N.=9). Participants' were evaluated on isokinetic dynamometer for isometric, and concentric (two velocities, 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s) strength of shoulder external (ER) internal rotation (IR). Isometric contractions lasted 10 seconds, and concentric modes were 5 repetitions.
   RESULTS: Bilateral significant differences, between dominant and non-dominant side, were found in ER peak torque at isometric mode in powerlifters group (P=0.021). Powerlifters showed higher IR peak torque at isometric mode in dominant (P=0.040) and non-dominant side (P=0.014) than physically active group. Pearson correlations between isometric peak torque and concentric velocities ranged between 0.49 and 0.89 for powerlifters group, and between 0.73 and 0.93 for physically active group. For agonist/antagonist ratio, pearson correlation ranged between 0.47 and 0.83 for powerlifters group, and between 0.48 and 0.86 for physically active group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral differences in ER movement at isometric mode in powerlifters suggest that exercises for shoulder rotators must be included on training for joint safety and balance between sides despite isometric shoulder rotators strength in powerlifters was higher than physically active individuals. Results presented positive correlation between both muscle actions, isometric and concentric, in peak torque and agonist/antagonist ratio.

AB  - Since Noar and Shamir introduced visual cryptography scheme (VCS), the cheating problem of VCS has absorbed much attention of scholars. The current researches on cheating immune have one or more of these serious disadvantages: (1) each share has extra pixel expansion, (2) some methods need extra verification shares to determine the share is genuine or not, (3) some schemes require a higher encryption/decryption overhead, and (4) the authentication procedure needs a trusted third party. In order to establish a novel cheating immune visual cryptography scheme (CIVCS) without pixel expansion, this paper generates n original shares by using random grid based visual cryptography scheme (RG-based VCS) and stamps authentication patterns on original shares to obtain verifiable shares, where the authentication patterns are three adjacent and non-intersect concentric solid black rings. In authentication phase, the authentication patterns can be revealed respectively by stacking any two verifiable shares in several ways, including rotating one of the two shares by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees counterclockwise. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel CIVCS without the above deficiencies. Furthermore, experimental results and theoretical proofs are provided for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed CIVCS.

AB  - Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is the main postoperative complication after intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in cataract surgery, because of the proliferation of the residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) in the lens capsule. Drug-eluting IOLs, aimed to develop an in situ drug delivery device, are the promising concept in recent years. As IOLs are optical devices other than implants, the feasibility and applicability remain a challenge for drug-eluting coatings. In this investigation, a centrifugally concentric ring patterned drug-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) coating was designed and fabricated by the spin coating technique. The concentric ring-patterned morphologies and the drug loading and release properties were carefully investigated, and the spin coating parameters were optimized. A concentric annular coating with a thin center and thick periphery was obtained, which was particularly suitable for the surface modification of IOLs, as the visual pathway of the intraocular light transmission greatly requires good light transmittance of the IOLs. IOLs with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA)-loaded coating (CsA @ PLGA) modification were then fabricated for PCO prevention. The in vitro LECs culture results showed that the CsA @ PLGA coating-modified IOLs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death. Western blot analysis showed that the efficient cell inhibition behavior of CsA was due to the autophagy-mediated cell death pathway. The in vivo intraocular implantation results confirmed the desired PCO inhibition effect. Thus, the centrifugally concentric ring-patterned drug-loaded PLGA coating obtained by the spin coating technique provides a simple yet effective alternative of IOL modification for PCO prevention.

AB  - The literature has revealed that knee injuries are the most common injury among basketball players. The strength ratios dominant/non-dominant and posterior-anterior around the knee joint are used to evaluate strength balances. But there has been far less research published about strength evaluation in professional-level basketball. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to compare hamstring and quadriceps muscles' strength values during concentric knee extension and flexion at different angular velocities at professional level basketballers, (ii) to determine dominant and non-dominant strength values during these contractions. 13 professional male basketball athletes voluntarily participated in the study. The leg strength was evaluated with an isokinetic dynamometer at 240-180-120-60 degrees/s angular velocities. The hamstring and quadriceps unilateral peak torque ratio (H/Q) and dominant non-dominant strength ratio were calculated. The independent west was computed to bilateral and unilateral strength outputs. There was no statistically significant difference between dominant and non-dominant strength values at peak torque, normalized peak torque, and H/Q at all angular velocities. Relative peak torque outputs in both legs were similar at all angular velocities. Also, the H/Q was calculated as >= 0.60 in all velocities. The results of this study suggest there were not any significant differences in the unilateral and bilateral evaluations of professional basketballers. These non-significant differences could be related to the necessity to maintain similar strength of two legs.

AB  - In this work, we explore the possibility of using drone networks to ensure the internet connectivity to IoT devices located in a larger geographical area with no Internet or other connections. The motivation for our work is a scenario of an early warning of forest fires in remote areas with no or with an intermittent GSM network coverage, where data from sensors are transmitted by drones to areas with network access. The paper proposes a model of such drone network, offering an insight into the possibilities for data routing from drone to drone to the point where Internet access is provided.
   After reviewing the field and the related research, we present the basic building blocks of the system and their properties: cells, drones, charging stations, network access points, and IoT devices or sensors. As drones are mobile network nodes, the data routing between drones represents the rules for when and to which neighboring drone the data is transmitted at a meeting of two drones. Our two basic routing algorithms are analogous with depth- or breadth-first search in graphs. The first is epidemic routing (flooding) where the data is passed on to all the neighbors, while in first-meeting routing, the data is passed on only to the first-met neighbor. The drone movement is important because it determines which of its neighbors the drone will meet. In our model, we use two types of movement, i.e. random movement and two-phase movement. In the two-phase movement, the drone first explores the entire surface of the cell in concentric circles, and then stays at the edge of the cell to meet the neighboring drones. After that, the drone visits all the IoT devices inside the cell again.
   The routing and drone movement are implemented with our simulation tool and the results confirm the suitability of the our system model as well as offer insight into both routing algorithms. Although not ideal, they are a viable alternative and, more importantly, they present a baseline for evaluation of future routing algorithms developed dedicatedly for the drone networks.

AB  - Introduction: To explore the short-term recovery effect of Compex8.0 myoelectric stimulation on the fatigued muscles of tennis players, and to provide a basis for the rapid recovery of muscles after fatigue and the prevention of sports injuries.
   Materials and methods: 16 male tennis players with the second-level and above majors in sports training in the Institute of Physical Education were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups. Fatigue of the dominant quadriceps muscle was modeled under the eccentric-concentric motion mode with an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s using an isokinetic muscle tester. After the end of the exercise program, the subjects all used Compex8.0 myoelectric stimulation for 10mins of recovery. The control group rested in place. Before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 10 mins after recovery, the maximum isometric muscle strength and explosive force were tested, and the data were analyzed and processed by SPSS.20.
   Results: After the end of the exercise program, the maximum isometric muscle strength (MVIC) and explosive strength (MP) of the Compex8.0 EMG group were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the quadriceps femoris was significantly fatigued; After recovery, the MVIC and MP values of the Compex8.0 EMG stimulation group increased significantly (P<0.05), while the recovery effect of the control group was not statistically significant (P>0.05); The recovery effect of MVIC and MP in the Compex8.0 EMG stimulation group was significantly different from that in the control group (P>0.05).
   Conclusion: Compex8.0 EMG can restore the maximum strength and explosive power of fatigued muscles in a short time, which can be used as an effective method for tennis players to quickly recover muscle fatigue during training or between competitions.

KW  - Photoresist edge bead removal (EBR)
KW  - Hough Transform
AB  - This paper discusses a low-cost, computer vision based approach to indirectly estimate on-chuck substrate (wafer) placement errors for photoresist spin coating processes in a semiconductor manufacturing environment. Placement errors are estimated by calculating the relative displacement vector between circles bounding the wafer and the photoresist region post edge bead removal (EBR) processing. On-chuck wafer placement is critical in maintaining concentric EBR performances and without a method of detection it is challenging to contain mechanical tool failures, incorrectly performed preventive maintenance (PM) or other human errors. The study revisits the Hough transform (HT) for circle detections from accuracy and computational viewpoints using synthetically generated images. The detection accuracy of HT is proven outstanding. However, processing times dramatically increase (hours) in case of high resolution, real wafer images despite adequate preprocessing. This drawback is compensated by processing only subsets of images relying on mechanical wafer position controls during the wafer scan although, this potentially undermines the overall accuracy of this classical approach.

AB  - This paper introduces a fast single-cut near-field to far-field transformation method using amplitude-only data. By measuring the antenna near-field amplitude on two concentric rings, the complex far-field for the corresponding ring plane can be retrieved. This avoids the full spherical scanning of traditional near-field measurements if one is interested in only a few radiation pattern cuts. In addition, the phase retrieval algorithm benefits from the reduced dimensionality of the problem. Because the number of unknowns have been reduced to a single ring, the performance is improved with respect to standard full spherical phaseless approaches. The proposed single-cut phaseless technique is tested using simulated and measured data, showing its potential for fast and more reliable amplitude-only measurements.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a path-planning problem for stereotactic neurosurgery using concentric tube robots. The main goal is to reach a given region of interest inside the brain, e.g. a tumor, starting from a feasible point on the skull with an ideally short path avoiding certain sensitive brain areas. To describe the shape of the entire cannula from an entry point to the point of interest we use an existing mechanical model for continuum robots. We show numerically that our approach enables the surgeon to reach areas within the brain that would be impossible with a straight cannula as it is currently state of the art.

AB  - The present study proposes an innovative opto-chemical treatment using a basket-integrated optical device (BIOD) to disinfect mature bacterial biofilm on endoscope channels. A BIOD was designed to position an optical diffuser on the central axis of an endoscope channel and to distribute laser light concentrically to the bacterial biofilm on the channel surface. To apply thermal damage and oxidative stress to the bacterial biofilm, a low concentration of a crosslinking agent (glutaraldehyde -0.5%) was combined with 808 nm infrared (IR) and 405 nm blue (BL) laser lights. The applied irradiances of IR and BL were 10 W/cm(2) and 1.6 W/cm(2) for Teflon channel model and 20 W/cm(2) and 3.2 W/cm(2) for a clinical model, respectively. Individual irradiation of either IR or BL for 180 s induced the maximum temperatures of 62 +/- 2 degrees C and 53 +/- 3 degrees C on the biofilm, respectively. The simultaneous opto-chemical treatment reduced a significant population of the bacterial biofilms (7.5-log(10) for Staphylococcus aureus and 7.1-log(10) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which were 2.9-fold and 3.9-fold higher than that of the standard treatment with 2% glutaraldehyde (GA) solution, respectively. The proposed opto-chemical disinfection method can help reduce multi-drug resistant bacteria and prevent cross-infection during the clinical usage of a flexible endoscope.

AB  - Multidimensional numerical simulations are performed to investigate the evolution and formation of unburned fuels for a shock-fuel jet interaction scenario. A full set of Navier-Stokes equations with detailed chemical mechanisms are solved, and the results are analyzed through the Lagrangian method with the goal of improving combustion efficiency in supersonic flows. The flame morphology of a two-dimensional (2-D) non-premixed reactive shock-bubble interaction is first simulated and studied, in which unburned hydrogen is found to prevent efficient combustion. By applying the Lagrangian particle tracking method, most of the unburned hydrogen wrapped into the primary vortex turns out to be initially located upon the symmetry line of the bubble. Motivated by the idea of breaking the primary vortex, this study designs a novel geometry of a concentric bubble, which improves combustion efficiency to 94.4% in contrast to a solid fuel bubble (74%) due to multivortex interaction and a thick bridge structure. With the consistency between qualitative and quantitative 2-D and three-dimensional (3-D) flow dynamics, the idea of a 2-D concentric-bubble configuration is effectively extended to a 3-D coaxial jet interacting with oblique shock despite the existence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

AB  - Aim Although protected areas (PAs) are assumed to reduce natural threats within boundaries, their spillover effects remain equivocal. It is necessary to determine whether PAs truly achieve conservation targets and whether they promote or inhibit natural habitat degradation in adjacent areas by blockage or leakage spillover. This study aims to choose 54 nature reserves (NRs) focusing on forest protection as a case study to assess PA conservation effectiveness and spillover prevalence. Location PAs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Methods We used matching methods to compare deforestation rates inside PAs and their 20 km buffer zones with matched control areas based on the Global Forest Change dataset from 2001 to 2019. We contrasted the effects of NRs with different management levels, ages and areas. We designed five concentric buffer zones to assess spillover change with distance and estimated potential drivers of the spillover effect to explain its directions and magnitudes. Results 75.9% of the NRs were effective in preventing deforestation within their boundaries. NRs with different properties showed similar performance on forest conservation. Spillover effects were heterogeneous around NRs. One hundred and twenty-two buffer zones had positive spillover ranging from 0.1% to 5.3%. One hundred and nineteen buffer zones had leakages from -8.84% to -0.1%. Blockages slightly outnumbered leakages at different distances, while leakages happened more frequently when we treated buffer zones as a whole spillover area. The linear model indicated NR age and population density of buffer zones were the most relevant predictors to spillover value. Main conclusions Most PAs performed well in forest conservation. Leakages could undermine or offset PA conservation efforts and were related to multiple natural or socio-economic factors. We recommend considering the plurality of PAs as well as spillover effect and incorporating a social-ecological framework in further PA establishment and management.

AB  - Two spatiotemporally distant deposits in western North America on differing sides of the K-Pg boundary are recognized to have accumulated innumerable ferruginous faecal-like specimens consisting of 3-D casts suspended in kaolin clay fills of lacustrine and riparian areas proximal to fluvial channels. Evidence presented interprets these specimens as organic in origin, consisting of coprolites and other bromalites (cololites), at the Readlyn deposit of the Whitemud Formation (Maastrichtian) in southern Saskatchewan and the Salmon Creek deposit of the Wilkes Formation (Miocene) near Toledo, Washington State. Comparable taphonomic processes at each deposit are suggested by preservation of identical, metre-long, enigmatic casts of the digestive system (cololites) of an unknown animal associated with the innumerable coprolites. Micro-fabrics of specimen interiors suggest that microbial mats entombed faecal and other organic entities in kaolin-rich lacustrine muds. This research proposes that microbial-induced ferrihydrite precipitation rapidly transformed into thin encrustations of goethite, encasing faecal droppings and other organic remains. Ferrihydrite-goethite-hematite biomineral sequencing cemented kaolin and quartz silt grains at the interface with the organic remains, precluding significant decay and thereby preserving external surface morphologies as encrustations. The mm-thick layers of the cemented sediment enveloped the organic droppings as rigid goethite moulds, preventing the collapse of the encasement morphologies as the organic residues were replaced by biominerals. Concentric growth layers of microbial mat-induced ferrihydrite-goethite cement progressed inward, resulting in 3-D casts. Only external morphologies were preserved, but often with finely detailed surface textures. The interiors of the casts preserve evidence of interconnected fabrics of pseudomorphed bacterial cell walls consisting of radially arranged jackets of acicular (Readlyn deposit) or platy (Salmon Creek deposit) goethite crystallites. Concretionary siderite replacement fabrics in some specimens resulted in the obliteration of the earlier microbial induced biomineral fabrics. Previous interpretations that the Wilkes Formation specimens resulted from inorganic processes only, thereby pseudo-coprolites, have been reappraised as faecal droppings comparable to coprolites of the Whitemud Formation.

AB  - In this contribution, three new species of sternaspids collected from sediments along the coast of southern Thailand are described: Petersenaspis apinyae sp. nov. from a depth of 50-80 m offshore in the Gulf of Thailand; P. narisarae sp. nov. from 9 m depth in the Songkhla Sea, Gulf of Thailand; and P. pakbaraensis sp. nov. from tidal mudflats on the Andaman Coast. All three species resemble P. palpallatoci Sendall & Salazar-Vallejo, 2013. They differ mainly in the pigmentation and shape of the shield, the number of ventral chaetae and chaetae at the posterior shield, body papillae, and size of the abdomen. Further, P. apinyae sp. nov. is clearly distinguished from other species of the genus by having dark orange to red butterfly wing-shaped shields, with strongly curved anterior margins. P. narisarae sp. nov. differs from other species by having concentric colored bands over shields and an expanded oval abdomen. P. pakbaraensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species by its dark brown-purple shield and laterally expanded fan. These three species have a unique character in their branchial plates: long brownish filaments. A key to the identification of all species of Petersenaspis is included.

KW  - REPRESENTATIONS
AB  - Most topological insulators (TIs) discovered today in spinful systems can be transformed from topological semimetals (TSMs) with vanishing bulk gap via introducing the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which manifests the intrinsic links between the gapped topological insulator phases and the gapless TSMs. Recently, we have discovered a family of TSMs in time-reversal invariant spinless systems, which host butterfly-like nodal-lines (NLs) consisting of a pair of identical concentric intersecting coplanar ellipses (CICE). In this Communication, we unveil the intrinsic link between this exotic class of nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) and a Z(4) = 2 topological crystalline insulator (TCI), by including substantial SOC. We demonstrate that in three space groups (i.e., Pbam (No.55), P4/mbm (No.127), and P4(2)/mbc (No.135)), the TCI supports a fourfold Dirac fermion on the (001) surface protected by two glide symmetries, which originates from the intertwined drumhead surface states of the CICE NLs. The higher order topology is further demonstrated by the emergence of one-dimensional helical hinge states, indicating the discovery of a higher order topological insulator protected by a glide symmetry.

TI  - Influence of Casing Eccentricity on the Mechanical Integrity of Cement Sheaths in Fractured Wells
T2  - ACS OMEGA
LA  - English
AB  - During the fracturing process of oil and gas wells, casing eccentricity directly affects the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths, but the law and degree of influence are not clear at present, and there are no measures to address the influence of casing eccentricity on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths. This paper took the lead in developing a set of experimental devices for cement sheath integrity. A comparative experimental study on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths was carried out for the first time under casing concentric and eccentric conditions, and the influence of casing eccentricity on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths in fractured wells of the Wushi 17-2 oilfield was also investigated. The numerical simulation method was used to perform stress analysis on cement sheaths of fractured wells under casing concentric and eccentric conditions. The influences of casing wall thickness, cement sheath thickness, the elastic modulus of cement sheath, and formation on radial stress of the cement sheath were analyzed, and the mechanical integrity safeguard or remedy measures of the cement sheath under the casing eccentric condition were proposed for the first time. The results show that casing eccentricity can easily lead to stress concentration at the narrow edge of the cement sheath. Under the condition of the same strength of the cement sheath, the integrity of the cement sheath is more likely to fail under the casing eccentric condition. The tensile failure cracks are concentrated at the narrow edge of the cement sheath. With the increase in casing eccentricity, the stress at the narrow edge of the cement sheath increased, the critical failure pressure of the cement sheath decreased, and the failure pressure of cement sheath integrity decreased by 17.72% at a casing eccentricity of 33% compared within a casing eccentricity of 0%. Improving the casing center degree, increasing the casing wall thickness and cement sheath thickness, and reducing the elastic modulus of the cement sheath can minimize the stress of the cement sheath and prevent mechanical integrity failure. This study is helpful to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the cement sheath in fractured wells accurately and can provide a technical reference for optimizing the casing center degree.

AB  - Background Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common overuse injury that lacks effective evidence-based treatment options. Reduced leg girth has been associated with MTSS development because it is hypothesised to impair the ability of the leg to modulate tibial loading generated during foot-ground contact. Measuring total leg girth, however, does not provide specific information about the structural composition or functional capacity of individual leg muscles. Consequently, uncertainty remains as to which specific muscles are compromised and contribute to MTSS development. Therefore, this paper aimed to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to how the structure and function of the leg muscles are thought to be associated with MTSS injury. Methods The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Medline, PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-texts and Web of Science were searched until March 2021 to identify articles in which lower limb muscle structural or functional variables associated with MTSS injury were investigated. Results Seventeen studies, which were predominately case-control in design and captured data from 332 individuals with MTSS symptoms and 694 control participants, were deemed appropriate for review. The average Downs and Black Quality Assessment score was 71.7 +/- 16.4%, with these articles focussing on leg girth, tendon abnormalities, muscle strength and endurance, shear modulus and neuromuscular control. Of the risk factors assessed in the 17 studies, decreased lean leg girth and higher peak soleus muscle activity during propulsion were most strongly correlated with MTSS development. Individuals with MTSS also displayed deficits in ankle plantar flexor endurance, greater isokinetic concentric eversion strength, increased muscle shear modulus and altered neuromuscular recruitment strategies compared to asymptomatic controls. Conclusions Future prospective studies are required to confirm whether decreased lean leg girth and higher peak soleus muscle activity during propulsion are associated with MTSS development and to elucidate whether these structural and functional differences in the leg muscles between MTSS symptomatic and asymptomatic controls are a cause or effect of MTSS.

AB  - Background: This study compared the effects of performing different unilateral combined training interventions on diverse vertical and horizontal jumping performance parameters, change of direction, concentric and eccentric mean power, and their associated inter-limb asymmetries in young soccer players. Methods: Forty-seven young male soccer players (age: 15.5 +/- 0.9 years) were distributed into three groups. Two groups performed the same training volume with both legs, beginning with the weaker leg (Stronger Volume Weaker leg group (SVW), n = 14) or with the stronger leg (Stronger Volume Stronger leg group, (SVS), n = 15). The third group executed double the volume with the weaker leg and also commenced with such leg (Double Volume Weaker leg group (DVW), n = 16) during a 10-week period. Pre- and post-intervention tests included a single-leg hop, single-leg lateral hop, triple hop, bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps, a change of direction speed test, concentric and eccentric mean power during the lateral squat test, and their corresponding asymmetries. Results: Single-leg hop weaker leg, triple hop weaker leg, and bilateral countermovement jump improvements were achieved in the SVW (ES: 0.29 to 0.46) and DVW (ES: 0.55 to 0.73) groups. Between-groups analysis showed better results in single-leg hop in the SVW and DVW compared to group SVS. The DVW group achieved better improvements in countermovement jump in comparison to groups SVS and SVW. Conclusions: Groups that started with the weaker leg seemed to achieve a greater volume of significant changes than when starting with the stronger leg. Performing a double volume on the weaker limb does not guarantee further improved performance compared to other groups.

AB  - The progressive collapse phenomenon refers to a chain of damages in a structure where all or a large part of the structure is destroyed by an initial local collapse in it, which can lead to very disastrous results. Therefore, the prevention of progressive collapse has become a necessary action in the design and analysis of buildings and it is vital to investigate this topic more accurately. This study aims to present a proposed pattern in the configuration of braces at the height of a high-rise steel building for reducing the probability of progressive collapse. In this regard, the vertical displacement of 18-story structure with four scenarios of column removal and five concentric bracing patterns including V, Inverted V, X, discontinuous X-bracing at height, and a combination of X-bracing in the side spans and discontinuous X-bracing at height in the middle spans are investigated and compared. In this study, the Alternative Path Method (APM) is used based on the GSA guideline for the analysis of progressive collapse. The results of this research showed that the use of X-bracing in the side spans and discontinuous X-bracing in the middle spans in nonlinear static and dynamic analyses performed better in reducing the probability of progressive collapse than other bracing configurations. Finally, it is recommended to use discontinuous X-bracing at the height that would place the bracings in one direction and providing alternative paths for force transferring in the structure.

AB  - While granular segregation in partially filled containers has been studied extensively, granular dynamics in densely filled spheres is not fully understood. Here, surface band segregation and granular convection are reported in a rotating sphere of highly compacted glass beads. Distinct from the Rayleigh-Benard convection, granular convection has a butterfly shaped structure with vortexes of alternating layers of small/large beads, which is stable and independent of the sphere size. Two concentric interfaces at the zero tangential/norm flux are discovered, which divide the sphere into three layers from the surface to the core. The law that governs the jamming dynamics in rotating spheres remains an open question.

AB  - Introduction. This study finds the lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters on variable heights. Objective. This research aims to reveal the effects of drop height on lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters. Methods. Two AMTI force platforms and Vicon motion capture system were used to collect kinematic and dynamic signals of the lower limbs. Results. The drop height had significant effects on peak vertical ground reaction force and peak vertical ground reaction force in the extension phase, lower limbs' support moment, eccentric power of the hip joint, eccentric power of the knee joint, eccentric power of the ankle joint, and concentric power of the hip joint. The drop height had no significant effects on the reactive strength index. Reactive strength index (RSI) had no significant correlations with the personal best of high jumpers. The optimal loading height for the maximum reactive strength index was 0.45 m. Conclusion. The optimal loading height for the reactive strength index can be used for explosive power training and lower extremity injury prevention.

AB  - Lateral restrainers are traditionally provided in reinforced masonry (RM) walls to prevent the vertical steel bars from buckling. In the current version of the Australian Masonry Standards (AS 3700-2018), the use of lateral restrainers in RM walls is relaxed, if the vertical rebars are surrounded by grout annulus of twice the diameter of the bars. However, it is challenging to maintain the verticality of the reinforcing bars in the block cores to satisfy the grout annulus requirement without lateral restrainers. To address this challenge, restrainer bar chairs can be used in the construction of RM walls which are easier to employ in comparison to lateral restrainer ties. However, the implications of adopting restrainer bar chairs as an alternative to restrainer ties in RM wall construction are not well verified. In this study, the influence of restrainer bar chairs and conventional lateral ties restraining methods on the axial compression and out-of-plane bending characteristics of RM walls have been investigated. In total, twelve RM walls of dimensions 1390 mm height x 590 mm length x 190 mm thickness were constructed and tested, of which, four walls each were tested under concentric and eccentric compression and four-point bending. The experimental results revealed that the performance of RM walls with restrainer bar chairs and conventional lateral ties were similar, in terms of the observed failure modes, strength, load-displacement characteristics obtained under both compression and out-of-plane loading conditions. Strain measurements on rebars indicated that a composite action was ensued in both restrainer configurations. The capacities of the RM walls under compression and out-of-plane bending were also verified with three different masonry standards provisions and were found adequate with reasonable safety. Overall, it can be concluded that the restrainer bar chairs can effectively be used in RM walls to enable quick and accurate vertical positioning of the rebars and ensure adequate grout annulus around them.

AB  - Background. Strength and balance are important factors for soccer players to be successful. This study's aim was to determine the relationship between lower-limb muscle strength and balance control in elite male soccer players (n = 77). Methods. Concentric isokinetic strength (peak torque of quadriceps (PT-Q) and ham-strings (PT-H), hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio) was measured for the dominant and non-dominant leg at angular velocities of 60 degrees s-1and 240 degrees s-1, as well as the total work for extensors (TW-Q) and flexors (TW-H) for both legs (at an angular velocity of 240 degrees s-1only). Balance score (BAL score) was used for unilateral assessment of balance control using a Delos Postural System Test measurement tool. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to predict balance control using isokinetic knee strength performance for dominant and non-dominant legs. Results. Final modelling included peak torque of hamstrings at 240 degrees s-1 and peak torque of the quadriceps at 240 degrees s-1 for the non-dominant leg (R2 = 19.6%; p <= 0.001) and only peak hamstring torque at 240 degrees s-1 for the dominant leg (R2 = 11.3%; p = 0.003) as significant predictors of balance score. Conclusion. Findings indicate that balance control is widely influenced by peak hamstring torque and peak quadriceps torque at high angular velocity particularly in the non-dominant leg i.e., the supporting leg in soccer players.

AB  - Soccer teams integrate specific exercises into their typical workout programs for injury prevention. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the incorporation of a brief and supplementary training program that involves eccentric, balance, and core exercises into the weekly soccer schedule can cause positive neuromuscular adaptations. Twenty-one soccer players were randomly allocated to either a training (n = 11) or a control group (n = 10). All players followed their teams' typical program, consisting of 4-5 soccer-specific sessions plus 1 match, weekly. Training group players additionally performed biweekly, hamstring eccentric, balance, and core stability exercises for 8 weeks. Isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque (PT) of the hamstrings and quadriceps, changes in the center of pressure (COP) during a 30 s single-leg stance, and a supine bridge (trunk stability) test were assessed before and after the intervention. After the intervention, a 27% increase in hamstring concentric PT and a 33% reduction in COP sway in the stance test, were observed for the training group only (p < 0.05). These improvements were significant only for the non-dominant leg. Furthermore, the control group displayed an increase in COP sway during the bridge test compared to baseline values (p < 0.05), which reflects a deterioration in postural balance over time. Consequently, incorporating small doses of hamstring eccentric, proprioception, and core stability exercises into a typical training program of youth soccer players improves strength and postural balance in the non-dominant leg, as well as core muscle performance.

AB  - A finite element model of an aero-engine dual-rotor system with intermediate bearing supported by six bearings is set up. Three modes of non-concentricity caused by the assembly process are defined, namely parallel non-concentricity, front deflection angle non-concentricity and rear deflection angle non-concentricity. The influence of the non-concentricity on the vibration characteristics of the dual-rotor system is investigated in detail. The results show that the parallel non-concentricity and the front deflection angle non-concentricity have a significant influence on the bending vibration modals of the high-pressure rotor and the low-pressure rotor, but have little influence on the local vibration modals of the rotors. With the increase in the magnitude of the non-concentricity, the natural frequencies of the bending modals decrease continuously, and the mode shapes of bending modals and that of local modals may be interchanged, leading to the emergence of bending modals in advance. Therefore, the key parameters to be controlled in the assembly process are the parallel non-concentricity and the front deflection angle non-concentricity. In order to prevent the bending modal of the dual-rotor system from appearing in advance, it is necessary to control the parallel non-concentricity within 2 mm and the front deflection angle non-concentricity amount within 0.18 & DEG;.

AB  - A common approach for Augmented Reality labeling is to display the label text on a flag planted into the real world element at a 3D anchor point. When there are more than just a few labels, the efficiency of the interface decreases as the user has to search for a given label sequentially. The search can be accelerated by sorting the labels alphabetically, but sorting all labels results in long and intersecting leader lines from the anchor points to the labels. This paper proposes a partially-sorted concentric label layout that leverages the search efficiency of sorting while avoiding the label display problems of long or intersecting leader lines. The labels are partitioned into a small number of sorted sequences displayed on circles of increasing radii. Since the labels on a circle are sorted, the user can quickly search each circle. A tight upper bound derived from circular permutation theory limits the number of circles and thereby the complexity of the label layout. For example, 12 labels require at most three circles. When the application allows it, the labels are presorted to further reduce the number of circles in the layout. The layout was tested in a user study where it significantly reduced the label searching time compared to a conventional single-circle layout.

AB  - Background Running is a very popular activity and muscle strength imbalance has been treated with caution to prevent injuries. Aim The present study aimed to compare and correlate knee flexion and extension strength imbalance based on peak torque (PT) and total work (TW) in running athletes. Methods Thirty-eight male amateur running athletes (38 +/- 6 years; 80.6 +/- 8.3 kg; 177 +/- 7 cm; 7.8 +/- 8.4 years of training; 3.5 +/- 0.9 training sessions a week; 33.5 +/- 13.4 km of training per week) took part in the present study. Knee flexion eccentric and concentric PT and TW, as well as concentric knee extension PT and TW were assessed. PT- and TW-based hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (H:Q), as well as PT and TW contralateral imbalance were quantified. Results A significant correlation was observed between TW and PT concentric knee flexion contralateral deficits (r = 0.52, p < 0.001). No further correlations were found among TW- and PT-based muscle strength imbalance variables (p > 0.05). All mean comparisons of H:Q and contralateral imbalances using TW or PT were significantly different (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our results showed that TW and PT muscle strength imbalance were unrelated, and the H:Q and contralateral imbalance profile of endurance runners may differ based on the isokinetic variable analyzed.

AB  - Introduction: Elite youth soccer players suffer increasing numbers of injuries owing to constantly increasing physical demands. Deficits in neuromuscular performance may increase the risk of injury. Injury risk factors need to be identified and practical cut-off scores defined. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess neuromuscular performance parameters within a laboratory-based injury risk screening, to investigate their association with the risk of non-contact lower extremity injuries in elite youth soccer players, and to provide practice-relevant cut-off scores.
   Methods: Sixty-two elite youth soccer players (age: 17.2 +/- 1.1 years) performed unilateral postural control exercises in different conditions, isokinetic tests of concentric and eccentric knee extension and knee flexion (60 degrees/s), isometric tests of hip adduction and abduction, and isometric tests of trunk flexion, extension, lateral flexion and transversal rotation during the preseason period. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. Risk profiling was assessed using a multivariate approach utilizing a Decision Tree model [Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method].
   Results: Twenty-five non-contact injuries were registered. The Decision Tree model selected the COP sway, the peak torque for knee flexion concentric, the functional knee ratio and the path of the platform in that hierarchical order as important neuromuscular performance parameters to discriminate between injured and non-injured players. The classification showed a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.91. The relative risk was calculated at 4.2, meaning that the risk of suffering an injury is four times greater for a player, who has been classified as injured by the Decision Tree model.
   Conclusion: Measuring static postural control, postural control under unstable condition and the strength of the thigh seem to enable a good indication of injury risk in elite youth soccer players. However, this finding has to be taken with caution due to a small number of injury cases. Nonetheless, these preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and in planning and developing customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors in elite youth soccer players.

AB  - Modulation using a higher sided polygonal space vector structure (SVS) is an elegant method to increase the linear modulation range and to eliminate the undesired lower order harmonics from motor phase voltage. This article presents the generation of a dense 15-concentric 30-sided multilevel SVS using a single dc-link for an open end induction motor (OEIM) drive. The proposed scheme eliminates lower order harmonics till 25th order from motor phase voltage throughout the modulation range. The dv/dt stress in the phase voltage applied to the motor will also be highly reduced owing to the multilevel structure. The pulsewidth modulation scheme employed utilizes the denseness of SVS and avoids iterative searches to find the triangle, which encompasses the tip of reference voltage vector, which are typical in multilevel polygonal SVS. The topology consists of an active dc-link fed three-level primary inverter and a capacitor fed five-level secondary inverter connected to either end of an OEIM. The primary inverter acts as the active power supplier for the drive and the secondary inverter filters out the undesirable lower order harmonics from motor phase voltage. The proposed scheme is experientially validated and the results are included in this article.

AB  - The variability of morphological traits (the shape and size of the forewing, and the location, number and diameter of eyespots in the submarginal band of the wing pattern) was studied and analyzed in two species of Satyridae, Aphantopus hyperantus (Linnaeus 1758) and Erebia ligea (Linnaeus 1758), that live together in the same places in the Sverdlovsk Region, Urals. The micropopulations of the monovoltine generalist species, A. hyperantus are assumed to be weakly isolated and are phenotypically homogeneous because they live in places that are only slightly separated from one another (about 10 km apart) within the same forested area, but remaining united by a common network of corridors (roads, glades). In contrast, the micropopulations of the bicyclic specialist species, E. ligea are isolated to a greater extent and, accordingly, are more strongly differentiated phenotypically. Phenetic methods, as well as traditional and geometric morphometrics were used when analyzing the variability of the morphological traits. In both species, significant differences between micropopulations were found in wing shape and size, as well as in the location and stability of eyespots in the wing pattern. As expected, the isolation of micropopulations through time and distance could have led to micropopulational differentiation in E. ligea. The initial hypothesis concerning the homogeneity of the A. hyperantus population in the territory surveyed was not confirmed. Distance isolation appears to be sufficient if the species is significantly sedentary and fails in seeking the existing corridors for dispersion.

TI  - Novel family of topological semimetals with butterflylike nodal lines

KW  - POLARIZATION
KW  - CATALOG
AB  - In recent years, the exotic properties of topological semimetals (TSMs) have attracted great attention and significant efforts have been made in seeking new topological phases and material realization. In this work, we propose a family of TSMs which harbors an unprecedented nodal line (NL) landscape consisting of a pair of concentric intersecting coplanar ellipses (CICEs) at half-filling. Meanwhile, the CICE at half-filling guarantees the presence of a second pair of CICEs beyond half-filling. Both CICEs are linked at fourfold degenerate points at zone boundaries. In addition, we identify the generic criteria for the existence of the CICE in a time-reversal-invariant spinless fermion system or a spinful system with negligible spin-orbital coupling. Consequently, 9 out of 230 space groups (SGs) are feasible for hosting CICEs whose location centers in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) are identified. We provide a simple model with SG Pbam (No. 55) which exhibits CICEs, and the exotic intertwined drumhead surface states, induced by double band inversions. Finally, we propose a series of material candidates that host butterflylike CICE NLs, such as ZrX2 (X = P, As), Tl2GeTe5, CYB2 , and Al2Y3.

AB  - Background: Maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) may be associated with cardiovascular diseases in the offspring from childhood to adulthood. We aimed to investigate the association between maternal GWG and the left ventricle (LV) geometry and function in the offspring, and explore the influence of the intrauterine environment on early childhood cardiac change.
   Methods: Data of 981 mother-offspring pairs from the Shanghai Birth Cohort was used. Maternal pre-pregnancy weight and height, weight in the first trimester (<= 12 weeks), and before delivery were measured. The echocardiography, blood pressure, and anthropometry assessment were evaluated in the offspring at 4 years of age.
   Results: Interventricular septal thickness during diastole had a significantly positive correlation with total GWG [beta = 0.009, (0.001, 0.017)]. In the second and third trimesters, LV mass index [beta = 0.149, (0.015,0.282)], interventricular septal thickness in systole [beta = 0.027, (0.011,0.043)], and in diastole [beta = 0.014, (0.005,0.023)] were positively associated with GWG. The risks of eccentric [OR = 1.115, (1.232, 1.010)] and concentric hypertrophy [OR = 1.133, (1.259,1.018)] increased with the elevation of maternal GWG.
   Conclusions: This study suggested that the excessive maternal GWG was associated with the thickening of the interventricular septum in the offspring, especially during the second and third trimesters. Excessive GWG in the second and third trimesters was a risk factor for LV eccentric and concentric hypertrophy in the offspring.

AB  - Background Muscular responses to training programs with the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) have been widely investigated to understand its preventive effects on muscle strain injury. Conversely, little is known about muscular responses to the stiff-leg deadlift (SLD), an exercise that preferably activate the biceps femoris long head, precisely the knee flexor muscle most commonly injured.
   Aims The aim of the current study was to verify the effect of training programs using the NHE or the SLD on muscle architecture, strength, and functional performance of well-trained rugby players.
   Methods Twenty-three male rugby union players completed a 5-week training program using either the NHE (n = 12) or the SLD (n = 11). Biceps femoris long head muscle architecture, hamstring and quadriceps isokinetic peak torques, and countermovement jump performance were assessed before and after the training program.
   Results There was no significant group- by-time interaction for any outcome (p > 0.05). NHE group experienced higher percent increases than SLD group for biceps femoris fascicle length (similar to 14% vs. similar to 6%; p = 0.015). Within- group analysis indicated that NHE group presented greater effect sizes for muscle architecture outcomes, hamstring eccentric peak torque and hamstring-to-quadriceps functional ratio; conversely, SLD group presented greater effect sizes for hamstring concentric peak torque and countermovement jump height.
   Conclusions The NHE should preferably be used to enhance the hamstring eccentric strength and the biceps femoris fascicle length (our primary outcomes, supported by previous studies as risk factors for hamstring strain injury), while the SLD favor improvements in hamstring concentric strength and jump performance.

AB  - To better understand water inrushes originating from shaft-freezing holes, the hydrogeological conditions and water source were analyzed for a typical inrush case in the Yingpanhao coal mine in western China. The mechanism of this new type of water inrush was identified by considering the stratum movement caused by mining, the concentric annular channels of freezing holes, and the dynamic recharge of multiple aquifers. A new risk assessment model and corresponding grouting method were developed and the problems involving the prediction of water inrush and selection of the optimum grouting position were described. Detailed guidelines for grouting, including the layout of injection boreholes, slurries, grouting pressure and stopping criteria, were proposed. A grouting case targeting this type of water inrush in the Yingpanhao coal mine was introduced. Field studies indicated that open, concentric annular freezing hole channels provide favorable conditions for groundwater migration. The proposed method may effectively inhibit groundwater migration in multiple aquifers and prevent water inrushes through shaft freezing holes and provides an appropriate framework for water inrush prevention for similar mining areas in western China.

AB  - Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport where players mainly use their dominant arm for throwing a flying disc. Little is known about possible functional adaptations to this unilateral strain. The purpose of this study was to investigate shoulder rotation strength and range of motion (ROM) in elite Ultimate Frisbee players. We were especially interested in possible sport-specific functional adaptations of peak torque and work ratios as well as the range of motion of agonist and antagonist shoulder rotators regarding laterality between the dominant and non-dominant body sides. For this reason, the concentric external and internal isokinetic (60 degrees/s) shoulder rotation torque and passive glenohumeral rotation ROM were examined in 15 male subjects (27.5 +/- 5.5 yrs; all current or former members of the German National Team) and comparisons of dominant to non-dominant body sides were conducted. Maximum strength (work) during external shoulder rotation was higher on the dominant body side compared with the non-dominant body side (8.4 +/- 8.4 %; p < 0.01). No side-to-side differences were found in maximum internal rotation strength. Internal rotation ROM and total ROM were smaller on the dominant body side (21 +/- 18 %; p < 0.01 and 5 +/- 9 %; p < 0.05). Our findings indicate similar adaptation patterns of shoulder rotation mobility compared to other overhead sports, but differing results regarding shoulder rotation strength. Stretching exercises and monitoring programs are recommended for elite Ultimate Frisbee players, starting at the early stages of the career.

AB  - Background: The present study compared the effects of performing the lateral squat exercise in three different formats from eccentric overload training on concentric/eccentric peak/mean power and inter-limb asymmetries in young soccer players. Methods: Forty-five young male (U-17) soccer players were distributed into three groups. Two groups performed the same training volume with both legs, beginning with the weaker leg (SVW, n = 15) or with the stronger leg (SVS, n = 15). The third group executed double volume with the weaker leg and also commenced with such leg (DVW, n = 15) in the lateral squat during a 10-week period. Pre- and post-intervention metrics included concentric and eccentric peak/mean power during the lateral squat test and their corresponding asymmetries. Results: All groups improved all power variables. Concentric mean and peak power asymmetry were substantially reduced in the SVW (ES: 0.89), DVW (ES: 0.43), and in SVW (ES: 1.60). Eccentric mean and peak power asymmetry were also substantially decreased in SVW (ES: 0.81) and in DVW (ES: 0.68). Between-group analyses showed substantially better performance in concentric and eccentric variables with stronger and weaker legs in SVW and DVW groups compared with SVS. Conclusions: Those groups which started with the weaker leg showed greater both power enhancements and reductions on inter-limb asymmetries.

AB  - Background: The use of an eccentric glenosphere (EG) has been proposed as a way to prevent scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of an EG decreases scapular notching compared with matched standard concentric glenosphere (CG) controls.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed. This study included 49 RSAs with an EG and 49 paired RSAs with a CG with a minimum 60 months of both clinical and radiographic follow-up. Clinical and radiologic outcomes of the EG and CG groups were compared at inclusion and at the last follow-up using the paired Student t test for quantitative data and the chi(2) test for qualitative data. Scapular notching was graded according to the Sirveaux classification. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
   Results: Notching was observed 2.7 times (95% confidence interval, 1.0-6.8 times) more often in the CG group (P = .037). The difference in notching severity between the groups was not statistically relevant; however, there was a trend toward more severe notching in the CG group (P = .059). Compared with a CG, an EG did not increase the percentage of radiolucent lines around the screws (3% vs. 1.5%, P = .62), around the post (3% vs. 1.5%, P = .62), or below the baseplate (15% vs. 7.5%, P = .18).
   Conclusion: EGs are associated with less notching than CGs. This finding confirms that RSA with an EG is an effective procedure without specific complications at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. (C) 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments can provide tight environment-phenotype matching. However, the prerequisite is a reliable environmental cue(s) that enables organisms to use current environmental information to induce the development of a phenotype with high fitness in a forthcoming environment. Here, we quantify predictability in the timing of precipitation and temperature change to examine how this is associated with seasonal polyphenism in tropical Mycalesina butterflies. Seasonal precipitation in the tropics typically results in distinct selective environments, the wet and dry seasons, and changes in temperature can be a major environmental cue. We sampled communities of Mycalesina butterflies from two seasonal locations and one aseasonal location. Quantifying environmental predictability using wavelet analysis and Colwell's indices confirmed a strong periodicity of precipitation over a 12-month period at both seasonal locations compared to the aseasonal one. However, temperature seasonality and periodicity differed between the two seasonal locations. We further show that: (a) most females from both seasonal locations synchronize their reproduction with the seasons by breeding in the wet season but arresting reproduction in the dry season. In contrast, all species breed throughout the year in the aseasonal location and (b) species from the seasonal locations, but not those from the aseasonal location, exhibited polyphenism in wing pattern traits (eyespot size). We conclude that seasonal precipitation and its predictability are primary factors shaping the evolution of polyphenism in Mycalesina butterflies, and populations or species secondarily evolve local adaptations for cue use that depend on the local variation in the environment.

AB  - A new seismic design method is proposed for the columns in two-story steel concentrically braced frames with bracing members intersecting columns between the floors. The method is intended to improve the stability of braced frame columns taking into account the interaction between the stories when the braces respond in the inelastic range. Furthermore, the proposed method aims to prevent excessive inelastic deformation in the braces intersecting columns between the floors considering the interaction between the stories, which otherwise may lead to brace fracture. The proposed design method is first presented in the framework of the North American steel design standards, followed by a design example to illustrate the method. Dynamic analyses are then performed to validate the design method and evaluate the seismic performance of the frame designed with and without the consideration of the method. The adequacy of the proposed method is assessed using further dynamic analyses when the location of the weakest braced panel is altered, oversized braces are used, and column orientation is changed. The results show that the proposed method can appropriately predict the column design forces, prevent column instability taking into consideration the interaction between inelastic brace responses in adjacent stories, thus improving the seismic response of the braced frame.

AB  - Elite judo athletes undergo vigorous training to achieve outstanding results. In pursuit of achieving competitive success, the occurrence of injuries amongst judo athletes is not rare. The study aimed to perform a knee flexors and extensors isokinetic torque analysis in elite female judo athletes. Fifty-eight elite female judo athletes of the Serbian national team (21.02 +/- 3.11 years; 62.36 +/- 11.91 kg, 165.04 +/- 10.24 cm, training experience 12.72 +/- 2.98 years) volunteered to participate in this study. The range of motion (ROM) was set at 90 degrees. Testing was performed in a concentric-concentric mode for the testing speed of 60 degrees/s. Five maximal voluntary contractions of knee extensors and knee flexors muscle groups were measured for both legs. The obtained data showed a statistically significant difference in absolute torque values among different categories as heavier athletes demonstrated higher values. Post hoc analysis showed a significant difference between weight categories, as heavier athletes demonstrated higher values, while no significant differences in normalized torque values for different weight categories were observed. The implementation of new elements and training modalities may improve performance and prevent lateral asymmetry, thus reducing the risk of injury.

AB  - Isokinetic dynamometry represents the clinical gold standard for strength assessment but testing lack consensus. Elite youth male football players (n = 28) completed 20 repetitions (analysed as four epochs) of eccentric knee flexor (eccKF) and concentric knee extensor (conKE) trials at 60, 180 and 270 degrees center dot s(-1), quantifying peak torque (PT) and functional range (FR). There was a significant (P < 0.001) main effect for fatigue and angular velocity in conKE PT; eccKF PT was not significant across epoch (P = 0.35) and velocity (P = 0.12) and a velocity x epoch interaction highlighted more repetitions were required to elicit fatigue as velocity increased. FR decreased with fatigue (P < 0.001) and velocity (P < 0.01) in conKE and eccKF, indicative of a narrowing of the strength curve. Clinical interpretation advocates an isokinetic test comprising at least 15 reps at a velocity >= 180 degrees center dot s(-1) and analysis beyond the peak of the strength curve (PT) to inform clinical reasoning and individualized exercise prescription.

AB  - This study investigated developmental changes in cold stressed microspores of Indica rice variety At 303. After 3 d at 10 degrees C, approximately 76% of microspores were in the late uni-nucleate stage. Even after 5 d, 49% of viable cells remained in the late uni-nucleate stage without advancing to the bi-nucleate stage. In comparison, microspores undergoing normal gametogenesis in planta progressed rapidly from uni-nucleate to bi-nucleate stage eventually forming tri-nucleate pollen during this period. Thus, cold stress prevented normal microspore development and retained cells in the late uni-nucleate stage which is the most favorable stage for in vitro induction of sporophytic development in rice. Uni-nucleate microspores subjected to cold stress showed a characteristic pattern consisting of several minute vacuoles surrounding a centrally positioned nucleus, which can be interpreted as an early indicator of sporophytic determination in Indica rice microspores. During in vitro culture phase, freshly plated yellow anthers became brown. After 4 wk in culture, 51% of the anthers had discolored. Significantly, all yellow anthers contained only non-viable cells whereas 10% of the brown anthers had few viable cells. Some microspores in brown anthers underwent division on callus induction medium. The first division was symmetrical and occurred after 2 wk. The second division occurred after 4 wk and resulted in four-celled structures. Anther-derived callus was either compact or friable. Histo-differentiation occurred mostly from compact callus. Cell clusters, each delimited by a protoderm, were observed in histological sections of callus grown for 2 to 4 wk on regeneration medium. Within a cellular unit, two heterogeneous cell populations were arranged in concentric rings with larger cells in the center and smaller cells towards the periphery. However, an apical-basal polarity that is present in embryo-like structures was not observed. Therefore, it may be surmised that in Indica rice, regeneration from anther-derived callus takes place not by the formation of somatic embryos but by direct organogenesis.

AB  - Developmental plasticity can match organismal phenotypes to ecological conditions, helping populations to deal with the environmental heterogeneity of alternating seasons. In contrast to natural situations, experimental studies of plasticity often use environmental conditions that are held constant during development. To explore potential interactions between day and night temperatures, we tested effects of circadian temperature fluctuations on thermally plastic traits in a seasonally plastic butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. Comparing phenotypes for four treatments corresponding to a full-factorial analysis of cooler and warmer temperatures, we found evidence of significant interaction effects between day and night temperatures. We then focused on comparing phenotypes between individuals reared under two types of temperature fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and individuals reared under a constant temperature of the same daily mean. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), and different types of dominance-like effects, with one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) having a larger impact on phenotype. Differences between thermally plastic traits, which together underlie alternative seasonal strategies for survival and reproduction, revealed their independent responses to temperature. This study underscores the value of studying how organisms integrate complex environmental information toward a complete understanding of natural phenotypic variation and of the impact of environmental change thereon.

AB  - Mn- micronodules and nodules of the Clarion-Clipperton zone (Pacific Ocean) are composed of 10 A and 7 A phyllomanganates, and delta-MnO2. The Mn-micronodules are built of fine concentric growth layers of three types (1, 2a, and 2b) according to their Mn/Fe ratio and Ni, Cu, and Co content. Applying previously developped geochemical discrimination approaches we found that the Mn-micronodules were diagenetic precipitates that were a result of suboxic diagenesis, whereas the paired Mn-nodules were diagenetic-hydrogenetic formations. The most common growth layers (type 2) within the Mn-micronodules are suboxic-diagenetic, whereas the rare growth layers (type 1) are mixed diagenetic-hydrogenetic and hydrogenetic precipitates. The suboxic diagenetic formation of the Mn-micronodules seems to be a result of the fluctuation of the oxic-suboxic front in the sediment since the Last Glacial Period (LGP). The migration of the oxic-suboxic front close to the seawater/sediment boundary during the LGP has likely resulted in suboxic reduction of Mn4+ and other elements in the sediment and their upward diffusion. Post-LGP deepening of the oxic-suboxic front has seemingly led to re-oxidation of Mn2+ in the pore waters and Mn-micronodule precipitation. The suboxic quantitative re-mobilization of seawater-derived Cesolid phase in the sediment (positive Ce anomaly) and its subsequent sequestration by Mnmicronodules resulted in positive Ce anomaly of the Mn-micronodules and Ce-deficient pore water. This Ce deficiency was recorded in the diagenetic Mn-nodules (negative or no Ce anomaly). The sediment pore waters were source of most elements in the Mn-micronodules and to the bottom seawater. The diagenetic processes were the major control on the Fe-Cu-Zn isotope composition of the Mn- micronodules and nodules. Measured Fe-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules can equally be explained by hydrogenetic and diagenetic precipitation. Considering our mineralogical and geochemical data we would suggest a rather diagenetic than hydrogenetic control on the Fe-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules: suboxic diagenetic reduction of the sedimentary Fe in the sediment, fractionation of Fe-isotopes that produces an isotopically light dissolved Fe pool, which leads to light Fe isotope composition of both the Mn- micronodules and nodules (-0.63 to -0.27%o). The preferential scavenging of 63Cu from seawater on the hydrogenetic Mn-Feoxyhydroxides accounts for the Cu-isotope composition of the hydrogenetic-diagenetic Mn-nodules (+0.21 +0.35%o), which is lighter than that of seawater. The identical Cu-isotope composition of the diagenetic Mnmicronodules is a result of oxidative dissolution of the sedimentary Cu-containing minerals, release of isotopically heavy Cuaq2+ in the pore waters and record of this diagenetic Cu-isotope pool in the Mn-micronodules. The hydrogenetic-diagenetic Mn-nodules have Zn-isotope composition (+0.75 - +0.87%o) heavier than that of the seawater which is interpreted to be a result of equilibrium isotope partitioning between dissolved and adsorbed Zn: preferential sorption of 66Zn on Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides surfaces. Preferential adsorption of 66Zn from the light Zn isotope pool of the pore waters on the Mn-Fe-oxyhydroxides has resulted in heavy Zn-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules and diagenetic layers of the Mn-nodules. The lack of robust assessment of the Mn-micronodule abundance in sediment volume unit and the insufficient geochemical data for the Mn-micronodules prevents a meaningful estimation of their resource potential.

AB  - Rotor assembly is a core tache in the whole process of aero-engine manufacturing. Preventing out-of-tolerance of concentricity is one of the primary tasks. Conventional assembly approaches are based on a manual test with the dial indicator, depending on experience appraises, which lack systematic and quantitative precision design theory. As a result, two issues need to be solved: the modeling problem of complicated geometric variations in three-dimensions, as well as the abnormal distribution of ubiquitous actual deviations. This work attempts to propose a novel probabilistic approach for three-dimensional variation analysis in rotor assembly. Based on rotor's revolving characteristics and multistage stacking process, Jacobian-Torsor model is adopted to establish the variation propagation, and Pearson distribution family is used to derive the probability density function, which can quickly determine the variation distribution pattern and efficiently perform statistical variation analysis. A real case of mechanical assemblies consisting of revolving axisymmetric components is concerned. The results show that the suggested method has a similar accuracy, but much higher efficiency than conventional methods. Calculations agree with the experimentations, and the probability distribution type of the part's variation has an appreciable impact on the final assembly precision.

AB  - The incidence of Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is increasing and at least 20% do not return to preinjury activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate biomechanical differences between those assigned to a Fear group and No-Fear group based on fear of reinjury during activity after ATR, by evaluating a drop countermovement jump. Twenty-five participants were evaluated 23.5 months after ATR. Peak values for eccentric and concentric joint power were identified for ankles, knees, and hips. Participants were assigned to Fear group or No-Fear group depending on their answers to a question regarding fear of reinjury during activities. Interlimb peak power was compared between groups for landing and push-off with a mixed model ANOVA. Compared to the No-fear group, the Fear group presented significant decreased power in the ankle (P < .001) but increased power in the knee (P < .001) in involved limb during both phases. A 3-way interaction was found between group, side, and phase for frontal plane hip power (P < .001). Our findings indicate that those who are afraid of reinjury demonstrate higher interlimb differences compared to those who are not. They also compensate for ankle deficits with greater knee and hip power.

AB  - Bromley, T, Turner, A, Read, P, Lake, J, Maloney, S, Chavda, S, and Bishop, C. Effects of a competitive soccer match on jump performance and interlimb asymmetries in elite academy soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1707-1714, 2021-The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a competitive soccer match on jump performance and interlimb asymmetries over incremental time points during a 72-hour period. Fourteen elite adolescent players from a professional English category 3 academy performed single-leg countermovement jumps pre, post, 24-, 48-, and 72-hour post-match on a single force platform. Eccentric impulse, concentric impulse, peak propulsive force, jump height, peak landing force, and landing impulse were monitored throughout. Interlimb asymmetries were also calculated for each metric as the percentage difference between limbs. Significant negative changes (p < 0.05) in jump performance were noted for all metrics at all time points, with the exception of jump height. Interlimb asymmetries were metric-dependent and showed very large increases, specifically post-match, with a trend to reduce back toward baseline values at the 48-hour time point for propulsive-based metrics. Asymmetries for landing metrics did not peak until the 24-hour time point and again reduced toward baseline at 48-hour time point. This study highlights the importance of monitoring distinct jump metrics, as jump height alone was not sensitive enough to show significant changes in jump performance. However, interlimb asymmetries were sensitive to fatigue with very large increases post-match. More frequent monitoring of asymmetries could enable practitioners to determine whether existing imbalances are also associated with reductions in physical performance or increased injury risk.

AB  - The application range of hyperspectral imaging is subject to the operational system platform especially relies on the core imaging spectrometer. With a rising practical requirement of extensive remote sensing recently, the traditional method of two or multiple separate imaging submodules combined has obviously brought inevitable shortages in certain cases such as mineral detection or environmental monitoring, etc. Not only is the whole imaging system somewhat so large in physical size and so high in weight that it has an objective influence on convenience as well as flexibility in actual operation, but also each independent instrument has unique optical parameters and assembling matrices after fabrication and alignment which is against the image consistency. Instead of common image correction and data processing, the essential solution is to set up a broadband integrative system platform. This paper introduces a new prototype of imaging spectrometer in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) to short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. Different from most existing research-based and commercial VNIR to SWIR imaging spectrometers, it is designed as broadband integration of a single core module. The main optical system consists of a collimating mirror, a central dispersive spherical prism, a converging mirror and two plane mirrors on the sides, which is similar to the normal convex grating spectrometer of three-concentric-mirror (Offner) configuration. The imaging spectrometer has relatively high imaging quality and satisfactory instantaneous field of view (IFOV) with a fairly compact internal structure benefiting from the integrated design and conscientious fabrication. The approach not only avoids extra expense and alignment complexities of multiple spectrometers but also enhances radiometric stability and reduces stray light and polarization effects. Relative performance tests are performed in various specific environment and validating imaging experiments are represented on schedule to demonstrate the expectant effectiveness of the whole system.

AB  - In this paper, a simplified modeling and analysis method for skyscrapers with an outrigger system is introduced. The simplified method is mainly based on the superelements and dominant degree of freedom methods, and it is codified by using MATLAB software. The simplified method results are verified with analysis results of the ETABS detailed model, where static, modal, and dynamic analyses are conducted. The proposed method's applicability on different configurations of tall buildings with outriggers systems is also verified through a parametric study. A comparative study with some previous studies is conducted to prove the efficiency of the proposed method. It was found that the adopted simplified modeling method has good accuracy in predicting the lateral displacements and inter-story drifts in the linear and nonlinear analysis. Furthermore, the simplified model has good accuracy in predicting the first modal shape and its corresponding period, while it has less accuracy in predicting the higher modal shapes and periods. Also, it was found that the simplified model underestimates the Max and Min story acceleration in comparison with the accurate model. The parametric study confirmed the proposed method's applicability on different configurations and topologies of tall buildings with an outrigger system. As a result, the simplified modeling method gives a deep understanding of the outrigger system behavior and its parameters. Therefore, it is an effective tool for modeling and analysis in the preliminary design stage. However, further improvements on the simplified modeling method should be conducted in future studies to increase the accuracy and quality of the obtained results and avoid its disadvantages.

AB  - Waking from a vivid dream, the sage finds himself lost between worlds of possibility and ultimately transformed. Zhuangzi's famous butterfly story may seem familiar, but the text-linguistic structures of its broader interpretive context are little discussed and poorly understood. In this paper I argue that the Qiwulun chapter, like so many other ancient writings, is composed in a concentric, chiastic pattern, with sections in each half mirroring each other throughout, while the central sections provide a pivotal peak and interpretive key that radiate meaning back out to the margins. To quote Mary Douglas, "the meaning is in the middle." The middle is also the place of Peircean Thirdness. In this paper I map the chapter's text-level chiastic structures and trace its intimations of Peircean semiotic pragmatism. The core rings of the text endorse contrite fallibilism while also prefiguring triadic structure, the pragmatic maxim, and the continuity thesis. Referencing cultural and historical contexts plus recent scholarship on Zhuangzi and Peirce, I ultimately argue that this ancient text, like the pragmatist semiotic it foreshadows, can be better appreciated and applied by embracing the interplay of centers and margins, discarding debilitating ideologies, and waking up to new degrees of freedom.

AB  - Radio-frequency (RF) driven helicon plasma sources can produce relatively high-density plasmas (n > 10(19) m(-3)) at relatively moderate powers (<2 kW) in argon. However, to produce similar high-density plasmas for fusion relevant gases such as hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and helium (He), much higher RF powers are needed. For very high RF powers, thermal issues of the RF-transparent dielectric window, used in the RF source design, limit the plasma operation timescales. To mitigate this constraint, we have designed, built and tested a novel helicon plasma source assembly with a fully liquid-cooled RF-transparent window which allows steady state operations at high power (up to 20 kW) and successfully produces high-density plasma with both argon and H. Deionized (DI) water, flowing between two concentric dielectric RF windows, is used as the coolant. We show that a full azimuthal blanket of DI water does not prevent high-density plasma production. From calorimetry on the DI water, we measure the net heat removed by the coolant at steady state conditions. Using infra-red imaging, we calculate the constant plasma heat deposition and measure the final steady state temperature distribution patterns on the inner surface of the ceramic layer. The heat deposition pattern follows the helical shape of the antenna. We also show the consistency between the heat absorbed by the DI water, as measured by calorimetry, and the total heat due to the combined effect of the plasma heating and the absorbed RF. These results are being used to answer critical engineering questions for the 200 kW RF device materials plasma exposure experiment being designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a next generation plasma material interaction device.

AB  - Background
   Studies have grouped different overhead sports and evaluated together the isokinetic strength of shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) rotator muscles. However, muscular adaptations could be a consequence of the specific sport, and some strength imbalance between these muscles may exist as a consequence of the muscular demand unique to the sport. Therefore, grouping different overhead sports together may not be adequate.
   Purpose
   To compare strength balance ratios between different overhead sports (volleyball, handball, swimming, judo, baseball, softball, functional movements performed at high-intensity interval training, and tennis) with a control athletic group (no overhead group).
   Study design
   Cross-sectional study.
   Methods
   A total of 237 athletes were submitted to isokinetic shoulder strength tests. The isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque values of shoulder internal IR and external ER rotator muscles were measured. Conventional (CR) and functional strength ratios (FR) were calculated.
   Results
   There were no significant differences between the sports for the CR in the male group. Female softball athletes (90.4 +/- 13.6%) had a significantly higher CR than judo (67.3 +/- 6.9%), volleyball (74.9 +/- 15.9%), and swimming athletes (70.3 +/- 8.7%). In the female group, judo athletes had lower FR values (0.76 +/- 0.19) than soccer athletes (1.31 +/- 0.35), volleyball athletes (1.24 +/- 0.27), functional movements performed at high intensity (1.10 +/- 0.1), and softball athletes (1.40 +/- 0.39). Female handball athletes also had a lower FR (0.99 +/- 0.25) than soccer athletes (1.31 +/- 0.35) and softball athletes (1.40 +/- 0.39). Male handball (0.90 +/- 0.23), tennis (0.86 +/- 0.30), and judo (0.68 +/- 0.22) athletes had lower FR values than soccer athletes (1.20 +/- 0.21) and volleyball athletes (1.25 +/- 0.28).
   Conclusions
   CR for males may be analyzed together, as there were no significant differences between them. However, for females, the CR for softball athletes should be analyzed individually. As there were several differences between the overhead sports according to the FRs, the authors suggest caution in grouping overhead athletes across multiple sports. These results could have important implications for the design of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs associated with the shoulder joint in overhead sports.

AB  - This work proposes the use of 2D Lattice Flower Constellations (2D-LFCs) to facilitate the design of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) slotting system to avoid collisions between compliant satellites and to optimize the available orbital volume. Specifically, this manuscript proposes the use of concentric orbital shells of admissible "slots" with stacked intersecting orbits that preserve a minimum separation distance between satellites at all times. The problem is formulated in mathematical terms and three approaches are explored: random constellations, single 2D-LFCs, and unions of 2D-LFCs. Each approach is evaluated in terms of several metrics including capacity, Earth coverage, orbits per shell, and symmetries. Additionally, a rough estimate for the capacity of LEO is generated, subject to certain minimum separation and station-keeping assumptions, and several trade-offs are identified to guide policy-makers interested in the adoption of a LEO slotting scheme for space traffic management.

AB  - Turbulent flames with compositionally inhomogeneous mixtures are common in many combustion systems. Turbulent jet flames with a circular nozzle burner were used earlier to study the impact of inhomogeneous mixtures, and these studies showed that the nozzle radius affects the flame stability. Accordingly, planar turbulent flames with inhomogeneous turbulent jet are created in a concentric flow slot burner (CFSB) to avoid this effect in the present study. The stability characteristics, the mixing field structure, and the flame front structure were measured, and the correlations between stability and the mixing field structure were investigated. The mixture fraction field was measured in non-reacting jets at the nozzle exit using highly resolved Rayleigh scattering technique, and the flame front was measured in some selected turbulent flames using high-speed Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of OH technique. The data show strong correlations between flame stability and the range of mixture fraction fluctuations. The flames are highly stabilized within a mixing field environment with the range of fluctuation in mixture fraction close to the range of the flammability limits. The mixing field structure is also illustrated and discussed using a mixing regime diagram and showed that the scatter of the data of the different cases is consistent with the classified mixing regimes. Lean flames are stabilized in the current slot burner. The flame front structure topology varies consistently from thin, small curvature at the low level of turbulence and higher equivalence ratio to more wrinkled, larger curvature, but a thicker structure at a higher level of turbulence and lower equivalence ratio.

AB  - The cloaking methods of infinite length coaxial cylindrical and concentric spherical invisibility cloaks in the non-uniform static field are investigated. First, the arbitrary potential function at the infinite boundary is expanded into a series of orthogonal potential functions. When there is only the nth order orthogonal potential function distribution at the infinite boundary, the analytical cloaking conditions of both the infinite length coaxial cylindrical and concentric spherical cloaks are derived. Furthermore, based on the analytical cloaking conditions, the approaching cloaking method is proposed in a complex non-uniform static field which composed of multiple orders potential functions. This method can acquire the optimal cloaking condition and avoid the iteration process by using numerical methods such as the finite element method etc. Finally, three examples are given to verify the correctness of the analytical cloaking conditions and the effectiveness of the approaching cloaking method proposed in this paper.

AB  - While velocity-based training is currently a very popular paradigm to designing and monitoring resistance training programs, its implementation remains a challenge in team sports, where there are still some confusion and misinterpretations of its applications. In addition, in contexts with large squads, it is paramount to understand how to best use movement velocity in different exercises in a useful and time-efficient way. This manuscript aims to provide clarifications on the velocity-based training paradigm, movement velocity tracking technologies, assessment procedures and practical recommendations for its application during resistance training sessions, with the purpose of increasing performance, managing fatigue and preventing injuries. Guidelines to combine velocity metrics with subjective scales to prescribe training loads are presented, as well as methods to estimate 1-Repetition Maximum (1RM) on a daily basis using individual load-velocity profiles. Additionally, monitoring strategies to detect and evaluate changes in performance over time are discussed. Finally, limitations regarding the use of velocity of execution tracking devices and metrics such as "muscle power" are commented upon.

AB  - The hotplate precipitation gauge operates by means of a thermodynamic principle. It is composed of a small disk with two thin aluminum heated plates on the upper and lower faces. Each plate has three concentric rings to prevent the hydrometeors from sliding off in strong wind. As for the more widely used tipping-bucket and weighing gauges, measurements are affected by the wind-induced bias due to the bluff-body aerodynamics of the instrument outer shape. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were numerically solved, using a k-omega shear stress transport closure model, to simulate the aerodynamic influence of the gauge body on the airflow. Wind tunnel tests were conducted to validate simulation results. Solid particle trajectories were modeled using a Lagrangian particle tracking model to evaluate the influence of the airflow modification on the ability of the instrument to collect the incoming hydrometeors. A suitable parameterization of the particle size distribution, as a function of the snowfall intensity, was employed to calculate the collection efficiency (CE) under different wind conditions. Results reveal a relevant role of the three rings in enhancing the collection performance of the gauge. Below 7.5 m s(-1), the CE curves linearly decrease with increasing the wind speed, while beyond that threshold, the blocking caused by the rings counter effects the aerodynamic induced undercatch, and the CE curves quadratically increase with the wind speed. At high wind speed, the undercatch vanishes and the instrument exhibits a rapidly increasing overcatch. For operational purposes, adjustment curves were formulated as a function of the wind speed and the measured snowfall intensity.

AB  - A photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with sub-wavelength air inner core and Ge-doped concentric ring outer core is proposed. The full vector finite element method with perfectly matched layer is used for simulation. Mode crossing phenomenon which can be controlled through the hollow core diameter is investigated. A PCF with an effective compensated dispersion range of ?1.38 ps/nm/km from 1460 nm to 1637 nm wavelength is designed. The dispersion compensating PCF (DCPCF) can compensate for the dispersion and dispersion slope of a standard single mode fiber (SMF) at the same time. The kappa value matches very well with that of the commercial single mode fiber. Moreover, the figure of merits inside air core region of the proposed DCPCF is improved by 21.3 dB at 1550 nm wavelength compared to a hollow core photonic bandgap (PBG) fiber. This field enhancement can effectively reduce the material loss and the nonlinear accumulation in dispersion compensation fibers.

AB  - Both the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) and the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are notorious for dominating hard substrates in freshwater ecosystems throughout most of the Northern hemisphere. Despite widespread observations of a dominance shift favouring D. bugensis, where both Ponto-Caspian dreiscenids co-occur, mechanisms driving this shift are still largely unknown. This study assessed whether movement behaviour differs between these two mussel species. That way we aimed at assessing whether mobility might be a contributing driver to the observed dominance shift. The mobility of dreissenids was assessed in an experimental set-up consisting of polyethene tanks marked with squares and concentric circles facilitating location tracking of the dreissenids by time-lapse photography. Specimens were collected at the Haringvliet and Hollands Diep in the Rhine-Meuse river delta. The experiments mimicked unfavourable habitat conditions by drying, cleaning, tagging and placing mussels in a new environment. After these disturbances, the movement rate, duration, distance, pattern and speed of 299 individuals were monitored. For both species, most individuals moved in more or less circular patterns, causing their actual movement distance to be twice as high as their displacement distance. The average movement duration within 24 hours after the start of each experiment was 65 min, with an average speed of 28 cm/h and an average distance of 29 cm. Hereby no significant differences were found between D. polymorpha and D. bugensis. However, a higher top speed was observed for D. bugensis than for D. polymorpha. The fastest individuals of these two species moved at 90 cm/h and 60 cm/h. respectively. Moreover, about twice as many D. bugensis individuals moved during the experiments in comparison to D. polymorpha individuals. Hereby it was recorded that any point in time close to 10% more D. bugensis specimens were moving around. The results support our hypothesis that D. bugensis could have a competitive benefit over D. polymorpha by having a higher top speed and a significantly higher number of individuals moving after a disturbance of their population. Detachment and mobility of sessile mussel species are supposed to be avoidance mechanisms during unfavourable environmental conditions. Therefore, mobility might be one of the contributing drivers of the observed dominance shift between both species.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate lower extremity muscle strength as risk factor for an acute ankle injury in youth athletes.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Basketball and floorball clubs.
   Participants: 188 youth (<= 21) male and 174 female athletes.
   Main outcome measures: 1RM leg press, maximal concentric isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings as well as maximal isometric hip abductor strength were measured and athletes were followed for an acute ankle injury up to three years. Cox regression models were used in statistical analyses.
   Results: In males, greater 1RM leg press and maximal quadriceps strength increased the risk of any type of acute ankle injury (Hazard ratio [HR] for 1 SD increase, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.12-2.39] and 1.43 [95% CI, 1.01-2.01], respectively). In females, greater 1RM leg press and difference between legs in hip abduction strength increased the risk of acute non-contact ankle injury (HR for 1 SD increase, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.03-2.02] and 1.44 [95% CI, 1.03-2.0 0], respectively). However, ROC curve analyses showed AUC:s of 0.57 0.64 indicating "fail" to "poor" combined sensitivity and specifity of these tests.
   Conclusion: Greater strength in both sexes along with asymmetry in hip abductor strength in females increased the risk of acute ankle injury. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A self-adaptive differential evolution neutron spectrum unfolding algorithm (SDENUA) is established in this study to unfold the neutron spectra obtained from a water-pumping-injection multilayered concentric sphere neutron spectrometer (WMNS). Specifically, the neutron fluence bounds are estimated to accelerate the algorithm convergence, and the minimum error between the optimal solution and input neutron counts with relative uncertainties is limited to 10(-6) to avoid unnecessary calculations. Furthermore, the crossover probability and scaling factor are self-adaptively controlled. FLUKA Monte Carlo is used to simulate the readings of the WMNS under (1) a spectrum of Cf-252 and (2) its spectrum after being moderated, (3) a spectrum used for boron neutron capture therapy, and (4) a reactor spectrum. Subsequently, the measured neutron counts are unfolded using the SDENUA. The uncertainties of the measured neutron count and the response matrix are considered in the SDENUA, which does not require complex parameter tuning or an a priori default spectrum. The results indicate that the solutions of the SDENUA agree better with the IAEA spectra than those of MAXED and GRAVEL in UMG 3.1, and the errors of the final results calculated using the SDENUA are less than 12%. The established SDENUA can be used to unfold spectra from the WMNS.

AB  - A new fossil leaf mine ichnogenus and species, Leucopteropsa spiralae gen. et sp. nov. (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), from the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation (Campanian age, c. 76.6 to 74.5 Ma) in Utah, USA, is the earliest record (75.6 +/- 0.18 Ma) and only fossil evidence of a lyonetiid-like leaf-mining moth, as well as one of the oldest known fossils within the Yponomeutoidea-Gracillarioidea clade. The blotch-style mine consists of a central oviposition, or egg laying, site with a spiral trail packed with faecal pellets that concentrically spirals outwards. The trail increases in width from oviposition site to terminus, the trajectory of the trail does not cross itself, and there is no apparent pupation chamber present. The morphology of the fossil mine is reliably associated with Cemiostominae and is most similar to mines produced by extant members of the genus Leucoptera, such as the mountain ash bent-wing moth, Leucoptera malifoliella, and the laburnum leaf miner L. laburnella. The leaf-mining moth responsible for L. spiralae may be an early member of the genus Leucoptera or other Cemiostominae genera, and the new ichnogenus Leucopteropsa is erected because the morphology, and therefore the taxonomy, of the moth specifically responsible for L. spiralae mines was not preserved in association with the leaf mine. Despite the phylogenetic analysis of 15 lyonetiids undertaken in this study and the need for further phylogenetic work for the Lepidoptera, particularly the placement of the family Lyonetiidae and the subfamily Cemiostominae within the larger Yponomeutoidea-Gracillarioidea phylogeny, this fossil provides an important Late Cretaceous (similar to 76 Ma) calibration point for lepidopteran phylogeny and serves as an indicator for the antiquity of the most diverse lepidopteran group, Ditrysia. Because lepidopteran body fossils are extremely rare, owing to their small and lightly sclerotized bodies, this discovery also underscores the importance of ichnofossils in the lepidopteran fossil record.

AB  - For a number of applications, it is essential to design fibers that exhibit nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion. Moreover, the nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion fiber should ensure the single mode operation to avoid the multimode dispersion as it is responsible for signal degradation. In order to control the nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion and single-mode regime, the present paper describes a new controlling technique of a dual concentric core fiber (DCCF). The finite element method (FEM) is used to investigate the properties. By introducing a varying index profile (alpha) in the core region of the DCCF, we can successfully design a single-mode operation fiber with nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion in linear or nonlinear application. Other important guiding characteristics such effective mode area (A(eff)), effective nonlinear refractive index (n2) are also discussed. The proposed DCCFs can be applicable in digital optical communication (dense wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems, for long-haul telecommunications networks and super continuum generation (SCG)).

AB  - An annulus is, informally, a ring-shaped region, often described by two concentric circles. The maximum-width empty annulus problem asks to find an annulus of a certain shape with the maximum possible width that avoids a given set of n points in the plane. This problem can also be interpreted as the problem of finding an optimal location of a ring-shaped obnoxious facility among the input points. In this paper, we study square and rectangular variants of the maximum-width empty annulus problem, and present first nontrivial algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms run in O(n(3)) and O(n(2) log n) time for computing a maximum-width empty axis-parallel square and rectangular annulus, respectively. Both algorithms use only O(n) space.

AB  - This study compares the effect of an isoinertial flywheel technology vs. a traditional gravity-dependent exercise protocol on modifiable factors associated with the incidence of hamstring strain (HAM) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Furthermore, the effect on repeated sprint ability was also considered. Eighteen recreationally trained volleyball players completed one of the following 6-week protocols: (a) flywheel (FY) included 3 exercises using a YoYo isoinertial-squat machine and 3 exercises with a Versa-Pulley isoinertial device, and (b) gravity-dependent (GT) involved 6 similar exercises with no external resistance (participants' body weight). Both programs consisted in 2 sessions.wk(-1) performing 2 sets of 8 repetitions with 2 minutes of rest. Outcomes included a 10-second tuck jump assessment (TJA), landing knee valgus score, hamstring and quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokinetic 60 degrees.s(-1) peak torque, optimal peak torque localization, conventional and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and 30-m repeated shuttle sprint ability (RSSA) test. FY improved TJA (-2, interquartile range [IQR] = -3 to -1) and valgus (-1, IQR = -1 to 0) scores, hamstring eccentric (20.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.27-31.47 N.m) and concentric (17.87, 95% CI = 0.40-35.34 N.m) peak torque, as well as the RSSA (-0.28, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.10 seconds), whereas GT only improved hamstring eccentric peak torque (21.41, 95% CI = 9.00-33.82 N.m). A 6-week protocol using flywheel technology seems to elicit better positive adaptations to protect athletes from HAM and ACL injuries and to enhance RSSA performance compared to exercising with no external resistance other than athletes' body weight.

AB  - A MIMO antenna having circular patch with CPW feeding is proposed in this paper. Design, Simulation, Fabrication and testing of MIMO antenna with different band notching characteristics are proposed in this paper. The designed antennas are suitable for portable UWB applications. UWB is the most promising technology which provides high data rate with in short range. In 2002 Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has approved a frequency band of 3.1-10.6 GHz for unlicensed applications. Within the band of UWB some of the wireless Communication bands with different frequencies are also operating. So to avoid interference, band dispensation characteristics are proposed. In this paper single dual, triple and quad band notch MIMO antennas are designed, simulated and tested and their results are reported. Elimination of interference with existing wireless bands like WiMAX, WLAN, X-Band Satellite Communication System and ITU is the prime focus of the paper. Concentric rings with rectangular split bricks are placed on the patch to eliminate the interference with the existing bands. Different antennas are designed and simulated using CST microwave studio software and the antenna parameters like Return losses (S-11), Gain, VSWR, Radiation patterns and Correlation Coefficient are measured. Quad band notch antenna is fabricated using RT/Duroid 5880 substrate material with height 1.57 mm. To get better Isolation the antennas are placed vertically and a stub is placed in between the antennas. The quad band antenna able to notch WiMAX, WLAN, X-band and ITU band and port Isolation (S12) is very good and envelope correlation is below 0.001 in UWB frequency spectrum.

AB  - The Jack Rabbit II (JR II) field experiments involved a series of trials in 2015 and 2016, each with 5-20 tons of pressurized liquefied chlorine released. All five trials in 2015 had vertically downward releases. The four trials in 2016 involved different release orientations. Roughly 200 chlorine sensors of four types (Jaz, Canary, MiniRAE, and ToxiRAE) were on the test grid at fixed locations during each trial, placed along 90 deg concentric arcs from 0.2 to 11 km from the source. These sensors use different technologies and have different detection ranges. All sensors were carefully calibrated, but pre- and post-trial challenge test results show that the MiniRAE sensors tended to drift. We applied special corrections to the MiniRAE data to correct for the drift. The roughly 19 million concentration records were further quality-assured and condensed to summary tables that include the maximum concentrations. This condensed data set was used in the model evaluation study described in the current special issue. Preliminary analyses suggest that, despite the necessary corrections to the MiniRAE data and the saturation of some sensors, the JR II concentration data in general are of good quality. For example, collocated sensors show good agreement, the arc-maximum normalized concentrations with downwind distance follow the -5/3 power law, and the limited sensor vertical profile data show that cloud heights increase with downwind distance. Future field campaigns of similar scale should carefully examine experimental setup and the latest detection technologies to avoid instrument saturation.

TI  - Analytical Calculation of Critical Anchoring Length of Steel Bar and GFRP Antifloating Anchors in Rock Foundation
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Antifloating anchors are widely used during the construction of slab foundations to prevent uplift. However, existing methods for calculating the critical length of these anchors have limited capabilities and therefore require further research. As the mechanisms which govern the displacement and stability of antifloating anchors are closely related to those of piles subject to uplift, a simplified anchor model has been developed based on existing concentric thin-walled cylinder shear transfer models used for pile design. Analytical expressions for the critical length of the steel bar and GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) antifloating anchors in rock are derived accordingly before demonstrating the validity of the method through engineering examples. The research results show that when the length of an antifloating anchor is less than a critical length, shear slip failure occurs between the anchor and surrounding material due to excessive shear stress. When the length of an anchor approaches the critical length, the shear stress gradually decreases to the undisturbed state. If the anchor length is larger than the critical length, the uplift loads are safely transferred to the ground without causing failure. The ratio of elastic modulus between the anchor and rock mass was found to be positively correlated with the critical anchoring length. Because the elastic modulus of GFRP bars is lower than that of steel bars, the critical anchoring length of GFRP bars is greater than that of steel bars under the same anchor-to-rock modulus ratio (E-a/E-s). The results show that the proposed calculation method for the critical length of antifloating anchors appears valid and could provide a theoretical basis for the design of antifloating anchors after further refinement.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel low-cost optoelectronic sensor to measure angular displacements from 0 to 360 degrees utilizing diffraction principles that avoid the need for complicated software and hardware designs. The arrangement of the sensor includes a cylinder attached to a rotary element in a non-concentric design containing a fixed laser that emits light to the wall of the cylinder which is made of a high-frequency diffraction grating film. The non-concentric rotational movement of the cylinder produces a variation of the distance between the orders of the projected diffraction pattern, allowing measurements of the angular position of the shaft. The mathematical design of the encoder was validated through simulations demonstrating its viability and reliability of the proposed equations. An experimental prototype was built to verify, via interferometric techniques, the resolution in the order of 0.03 [arcsec], therefore showing the potential of a low-cost diffraction optical absolute encoder with an outstanding cost-benefit ratio.

AB  - Eyespots on the wings of different nymphalid butterflies have become valued models in eco-evo-devo. They are ecologically significant, evolutionarily diverse, and developmentally tractable. Their study has provided valuable insight about the genetic and developmental basis of inter-specific diversity and intra-specific variation, as well as into other key themes in evo-evo-devo: evolutionary novelty, developmental constraints, and phenotypic plasticity. Here we provide an overview of eco-evo-devo studies of butterfly eyespots, highlighting previous reviews, and focusing on both the most recent advances and the open questions expected to be solved in the future.

KW  - Concentric circle grids

AB  - The accuracy of camera calibration depends significantly on the control point detection which customarily subjects to image noise, distortion and resolution. This paper uses concentric circle grids as the calibration pattern and accordingly proposes a robust and accurate control point detection method for camera calibration. Each set of concentric circles on the grids pattern consists of multiple circles whose radii decrease progressively. The geometric structure of multi-hierarchies can not only robustly extract control points from complicated scenarios but also build a voting scheme to avoid numerical instability resulting from the estimation of projected centers. According to the common self-polar triangle of concentric circles and the local sub-pixel edge detection algorithm, we efficiently estimated sub-pixel coordinates of control points under projective transformation. Simulations and real experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the performance of calibration using concentric circle grids is superior to the popular grid patterns with respect to the image noise, distortion and resolution.

AB  - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing process to build 3D objects on a horizontal plane from bottom to top. In the conventional FDM process, the printing of curved objects causes the staircase effect and results in poor surface finish. In this work, the FDM process integrated with a 6-DOF Industrial robot is used to print the curved objects by generating non-linear tool paths to avoid the staircase effect. A standard NACA 0015 aircraft wing having curved surfaces is printed without staircase effect at a uniform deposition rate using an industrial robot. The wing is sliced into concentric curved layers either in the form of convex or a concave shape. A new methodology is developed by combining the non-linear toolpaths with the change in extruder orientation to print curved objects at a uniform deposition without any staircase effect. ABB Robotstudio simulation software is used for simulating the printing process and simulation results are validated by printing the portion of the wing using the Industrial robot with an FDM extruder as an end effector. The experimental results showed that the aircraft wing is printed successfully with uniform deposition at constant velocity without any staircase effect.

AB  - The use of UAVs or drones for criminal or terrorist enterprises is an increasing problem. Many countermeasures have been proposed to prevent, deter, detect and/or mitigate the dangers posed by such malicious UAVs. One such countermeasure is to track or pursue a malicious UAV back to its point of origin using one or more surveillance UAVs in order to apprehend the UAV and possibly its owner. If the malicious UAV has a higher capability set than the surveillance UAVs, it will be able to outrun any one of them, and therefore the tracking responsibility must be distributed over a swarm of surveillance UAVs that are geographically dispersed across the tracking area of interest. One aspect of particular interest is how the initial formation of the swarm of surveillance UAVs impacts its ability to successfully track a malicious UAV. In this paper, we examine a specific circular initial swarm formation comprising uniformly spaced concentric rings of uniformly spaced UAVs. The total number of surveillance UAVs follows the sequence of centred hexagonal numbers as the number of rings increases. The tracking performance of this circular swarm of surveillance UAVs is compared to a reference swarm of the same size in which the initial locations of the UAVs are randomly chosen. Two tracking strategies are considered: 1) Reactive tracking, in which each surveillance UAV acts independently of the others and only pursues the malicious UAV when it itself detects it, and 2) Reactive tracking with predictive pre-positioning, in which once one surveillance UAV detects the malicious UAV, it communicates the estimated trajectory and speed of the malicious UAV to all swarm members so they can pre-dictively move to a more optimum tracking position before the malicious UAV arrives. The results demonstrate that this particular circular swarm of surveillance UAVs has superior tracking performance relative to the reference randomly positioned swarm of the same size; this is true for both tracking strategies, but particularly when predictive pre-positioning is employed with a relatively small number of surveillance UAVs.

AB  - When designing a wind or solar plant collection system, it is important to verify that the cable conductors and concentric neutrals can withstand the worst-case short circuit event during the life of the project. Existing standards provide equations for calculating the withstand capabilities of these conductors. However, these standards provide no guidance on what current value should be used in these equations. It will be shown that two commonly used methods are inaccurate, with one being overly conservative, and one being insufficient. An accurate method of determining the correct current value will be presented. The impacts to the cable sizing of two representative projects will be explored for all three methods. It will be shown that the accurate method prevents unnecessary cable up-sizing compared to the overly conservative method but causes additional cable up-sizing compared to the insufficient method. To conclude this paper, it is suggested that the new method be incorporated into the relevant standards to provide clarity to practicing engineers and to ensure that cables are properly sized in any underground cable installation.

AB  - During the past 20 years, more than 1,600 species of well-preserved fossil insects, including members of over 270 families within 24 orders, have been described from the Middle Jurassic Yanliao Entomofauna and Early Cretaceous Jehol Entomofauna in Northeastern China. Diversified fossil insects not only document the origin, systematics, and early evolution of many lineages, but also reveal these lineages' behaviors and interactions with coexisting plants, vertebrates, and other insects in their ecosystems. Fossil evidence has been documented, for example, regarding insects' feeding and pollination mutualism with gymnosperms; ectoparasitic feeding on blood of vertebrates; camouflage, mimicry of gymnosperm plants, and eyespot warning; sound stridulation for attracting potential mates; and sexual display, mating, egg-laying, and parental care. In this article, we review the diverse taxonomy of mid-Mesozoic insects of Northeastern China and elucidate their behaviors and interactions within their ecosystems, which have impacted their early evolution and development into extant insects.

AB  - Low-ductility steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings are considered to have reserve capacity after brace failure. This study proposes a series of shake table tests of a scaled two-bay, three-story, moment-resisting frame model with a pair of square hollow section braces placed in a chevron arrangement to examine its dynamic behavior. The model structure was repeatedly subjected to two earthquake records with successively increasing magnitudes. The failure mechanisms, reserve capacity, and overall collapse performance were investigated. The results show that the reserve system is sensitive to spectral characteristics of ground motions, especially for soft soil site ground motions.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of coordinating multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a circular formation around a moving target. The main contribution is allowing for versatile formation patterns on the basis of the following components. Firstly, new uniform spacing control laws are proposed that spread the agents not necessarily over a full circle, but over a circular arc. Uniform spacing formation controllers are proposed, regulating either the separation distances or the separation angles between agents. Secondly, the use of virtual agents is proposed to allow for different radii in agents' orbits. Thirdly, a hierarchical combination of formation patterns is described. A Lyapunov analysis is conducted to study the stability characteristics. This paper also addresses the practical issue of collision avoidance that arises while UAVs are developing formations. An additional control component is added that repels agents to steer away from each other once they get too close. All UAVs have constant linear velocities. Control of the UAV is via its yaw rate. The proposed extensions to formation on a portion of a circle, circling on different radii for different agents, formation in local geometric shapes, and inter-vehicle collision avoidance, provide more complete solution to cooperative target tracking in concentric formations.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Highly diverse color patterns of butterfly wings can be explained as modifications of an archetypical color pattern of nymphalid butterflies called the nymphalid groundplan. The nymphalid groundplan contains three major symmetry systems and a discal symmetry system, but their relationships have been elusive. Here, the morphological and spatial relationships among these symmetry systems were studied based on cross-species color-pattern comparisons of the hindwings in nymphalid butterflies. It was shown that all symmetry systems can be expressed as various structures, suggesting the equivalence (homology) of these systems in developmental potential. In some cases, the discal symmetry system is circularly surrounded by the central symmetry system, which may then be surrounded by the border and basal symmetry systems, indicating a unified supersymmetry system covering the entire wing. These results suggest that butterfly color patterns are hierarchically constructed; one system is nested within another system, which is a self-similar relationship that achieves the fractal geometry. This self-similarity is likely mediated by the serial induction of organizers during development, and a possible mechanism is proposed for symmetry breaking of the system morphology, which contributes to the diversity of butterfly wing color patterns.
   The nymphalid groundplan is an archetypical color pattern of nymphalid butterflies involving three major symmetry systems and a discal symmetry system, which share the basic morphogenesis unit. Here, the morphological and spatial relationships among these symmetry systems were studied based on cross-species comparisons of nymphalid hindwings. Based on findings in Neope and Symbrenthia, all three major symmetry systems can be expressed as bands, spots, or eyespot-like structures, suggesting equivalence (homology) of these systems in developmental potential. The discal symmetry system can also be expressed as various structures. The discal symmetry system is circularly surrounded by the central symmetry system, which may then be surrounded by the border and basal symmetry systems, based mainly on findings in Agrias, indicating a unified supersymmetry system covering the entire wing. The border symmetry system can occupy the central part of the wing when the central symmetry system is compromised, as seen in Callicore. These results suggest that butterfly color patterns are hierarchically constructed in a self-similar fashion, as the fractal geometry of the nymphalid groundplan. This self-similarity is likely mediated by the serial induction of organizers, and symmetry breaking of the system morphology may be generated by the collision of opposing signals during development.

AB  - Background/aim The purpose of this study was to compare the isokinetic peak torque profiles from the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles during concentric and eccentric contractions in elite Brazilian soccer players across different field positions and age categories. Our hypothesis was that soccer players from different field positions are subjected to different ageing-related effects on their isokinetic peak torque. Methods This is a retrospective study based on professional elite-level soccer players between the years 2009 and 2019. It included 570 adult males who played for at least 5 years on first or second Brazilian divisions. Playing positions were divided as: goalkeepers, defenders, sidebacks, midfielders and forwards. Age categories were also divided as: G1 (17-20 years old), G2 (21-24 years old), G3 (25-28 years old), G4 (29-32 years old) and G5 (33 years old or more). Results The results indicate a moderate effect of age (F(4545)=8.197; p<0.001; eta(2)=0.057) and a small effect of playing position (F(4545)=2.993; p<0.05; eta(2)=0.021) on torque of concentric extensors; mainly from midfielders and goalkeepers with 29 years or more. Conclusions Soccer players from different field positions are subjected to different ageing related effects on their muscular performance during their career special attention should be given to these players to avoid reduction in physical performance.

TI  - Subresolution Assist Feature Insertion by Variational Adversarial Active Learning and Clustering with Data Point Retrieval
T2  - 2021 58TH ACM/IEEE DESIGN AUTOMATION CONFERENCE (DAC)
LA  - English
CP  - 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)
AB  - As the feature size keeps shrinking in the modern semiconductor manufacturing process, subresolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion is one promising resolution enhancement technique that can improve the printability and lithographic process window of target patterns. Model-based SRAF generation achieves a high accuracy but with a high computational cost, while rule-based SRAF insertion may require a huge rule table to handle complex patterns. Thus, state-of-the-art works resort to machine learning to reduce runtime but require abundant training samples to generalize the trained models and achieve high performance. Nevertheless, in advanced lithography, we may have a huge solution space of SRAF insertion but few labeled training samples. Therefore, in this work, we address SRAF insertion from a data efficiency perspective. We separate sample selection from SRAF probability learning and train a variational autoencoder and an adversarial network to discriminate between unlabeled and labeled data effectively. Second, we devise a region-based concentric circle area sampling representation to avoid information loss during feature extraction. Third, we determine the final placement of SRAFs by a novel clustering method based on retrieved data points. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art works, by using 40% training samples, our framework can achieve comparable or even better process variation bands and edge placement errors.

AB  - This article discusses problems of the cultural option for communicating with the distant future. It presupposes not only biological but also cultural continuity. In order to compensate for language change it is suggested that the message be reformulated for each new language stage and that each new formulation be displayed on :sign posts located concentrically around the depository site at increasing distances. In this way a spatial reversal of language history would be produced which would enable every intruder to gradually learn to understand the language of the original message in the center of the site. Organizing the translations and deploying the sign posts would be the task of a committee of message protectors.

AB  - Predation of seeds of the cycad Dioon edule by mice has been previously documented, demonstrating that the seeds' toxins are not harmful when combined with a varied diet. However, there is scarce evidence that they are a seed disperser. In a tropical oak forest in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, we experimented with seeds of D. edule and Quercus polymorpha, evaluating predators' preference and recording it with photo-trapping. Burrows were sampled in concentric circles around a D. edule mother plant, and the types of burrows and condition of the seeds inside were identified with a borescope without destroying the burrows. The structure and composition of the forest were evaluated. The primary dispersion of D. edule seeds is by barochory. The rodents predate on seeds and prefer Q. polymorpha over D. edule (survival: 48.9% and 78.5%, respectively). There are more escape and multiple burrows at 3-6 m with mature oaks. Rodents forget or abandon D. edule seeds in the burrows, and such seeds germinate at 3-6 m. Peromyscus leucopus is a short-distance secondary disperser and predator of D. edule seeds.

AB  - Although isokinetic strength testing is commonly used in hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation and prevention, research findings concerning its predictive value remain inconclusive. Existing research focuses on peak torque (PT) and angle of PT, not analysing the torque behaviour throughout the testing range of motion (ROM). This study intended to assess the value of isokinetic curve evaluation in association with HSI. A sample of 116 male football players with and without a recent HSI history was submitted to bilateral isokinetic assessment of the knee and hip muscles. Raw isokinetic data were filtered and normalized prior to curve analysis submission in MATLAB. Torque development of each muscle group throughout the entire testing ROM was assessed using HSI history as an independent variable. Curve analysis revealed significant differences in torque behaviour in function of injury history. Players with an HSI history demonstrated significantly stronger concentric knee flexion and extension, eccentric knee extension and concentric hip extension patterns compared to the controls and their uninjured limb. HSI history was also associated with lower concentric hip flexion torques and lower mixed H:Q ratios compared to the control group and their contralateral limb. HSI history was associated with altered knee and hip muscle strength profiles, potentially due to isolated focus on local strength training in rehabilitation or mechanisms of neuromuscular inhibition. Because the differences in torque amplitude were range-dependent and did not systematically concur with the point of PT achievement, isokinetic strength evaluation should most probably be conducted using curve analysis.

AB  - Anchor systems are widely used to stabilize soil slope and suppress slope failure. Thus, monitoring conditions of an anchor system is important to prevent disasters due to slope failure. The slope condition can be indirectly monitored by sensing the tensile force applied to the anchor because the slope deformation directly affects the anchor force. Previously, we propose a way to monitor the tensile force of the anchor by measuring the strain field on a bearing plate using a distributed fiber optic sensor (OFDR) and experimentally demonstrate that the anchor force has a large correlation with the strain distribution on the bearing plate. However, it was found that a spatial variation of the strain and thermal strain due to temperature change makes it difficult to get a reliable correlation coefficient. In this study, we newly propose a way to get a reliable correlation coefficient between the anchor force and the strain field on the bearing plate. We install a distributed optical fiber sensor in two concentric circles on the bearing plate and measure circumferential strain distribution. We take average values of the strain field in each circle as representative strain values minimizing the spatial variation and takes a difference of the two strains to exclude the temperature effect. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method gives a reliable correlation coefficient between the anchor force and the strain field on the bearing plate. This technique can be applied to various anchor systems to monitor the anchor force and manage the anchor systems safely.

AB  - Eustace, SJ, Page, RM, and Greig, M. angle specific isokinetic metrics highlight strength training needs of elite youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3258-3265, 2020-The purpose of this study was to assess traditional and angle-specific isokinetic strength of eccentric knee flexors (eccKFs) and concentric knee extensors (conKEs) between senior professional and youth soccer players. Thirty-four male soccer players (17 senior and 17 youth) were recruited for bilateral assessments at 180, 270, and 60 degrees center dot s(-1). Peak torque (PT), dynamic control ratio (DCR), angle of peak torque (APT), functional range (FR), angle-specific torque (AST), and angle-specific DCR (DCRAST) were compared. The eccentric knee flexor (eccKF) and conKE PT (p = 0.782) and DCR (p = 0.508) were not different between groups across all angular velocities. Significant differences were identified for eccKF APT (p = 0.018) and FR (p = 0.006), DCRAST at 270 degrees center dot s(-1) (p = 0.031), and in AST data recorded across angular velocities for eccKF and conKE (p = 0.003). Traditional strength measures were not sensitive to playing age, with implications for misinterpretation in training prescription. By contrast, AST data did differentiate between ages. Strength deficits that highlight the muscle contraction type, angular velocity, and joint angle can be manipulated within an individualized training intervention. Given the relevance to injury etiology, this study highlights potential implications for improved assessment strategies to inform training prescription for performance and injury prevention. Given the high number of injuries in adolescent soccer players, and in line with previous recommendations, practitioners should consider using more informed and specific strength and conditioning practices at younger ages.

AB  - Traditionally, the P3P problemis solved by firstly transforming its 3 quadratic equations into a quartic one, then by locating the roots of the resulting quartic equation and verifying whether a root does really correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem itself. It is well known that a root of the quartic equation could correspond to 2, or 1, or even null solution at all to the P3P problem, and up to now, no explicit relationship between the P3P solution and the root of its quartic equation is available in the literature. In thiswork, we showthat when the optical center is outside of all the 6 toroids defined by the control point triangle, each positive root of the Grunert's quartic equationmust correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem, and the corresponding P3P problemcannot have a unique solution, it must have either 2 positive solutions or 4 positive solutions. In addition, we show that when the optical center passes through any one of the 3 toroids among these 6 toroids (except possibly for two concentric circles), the number of the solutions of the corresponding P3P problem always changes by 1, either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. Furthermore we showthat such changed solutions always locate in a small neighborhood of control points, hence the 3 toroids are critical surfaces of the P3P problem and the 3 control points are 3 singular points of solutions. A notable example is that when the optical center passes through the outer surface of the union of the 6 toroids from the outside to inside, the number of the solutions must always decrease by 1. Our results are the first in the literature to give an explicit and geometrically intuitive relationship between the P3P solutions and the roots of its quartic equation, aside its academic values, it could also act as some theoretical guidance for P3P practitioners to properly arrange their control points to avoid undesirable solutions.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on a chemotaxis model of multiple sclerosis, which is proposed by Lombardo et al. (2017) [10]. The model consists of a chemotaxis quasi -linear parabolic equation describing the evo- lution of the density of activated macrophages, a semilinear parabolic equation ruling the evolution of the concentration of cytokine and an ordinary different equation modeling the evolution of the density of apoptotic oligodendrocytes. In this model, activated macrophages stimulated by a cytokine move along the concentration of cytokine gradient, which is termed chemotaxis. Our first purpose is to rigorously prove the boundedness and global existence of the classical solution to this model by applying heat operator semi - group theory and establishing some a priori estimates. The another purpose is to study the global asymptotic stability of a unique positive equilibrium, which together with the Turing instability are two aspects char- acteristic of mutual complement.

AB  - Mystical literature and spirituality from 16th-century Spain engage religious images from the three most prominent religions of al-Andalus-Christianity, Islam, and Judaism: among others, the dark night, the seven concentric castles, the gazelle, the bird, the sefirot's encircled iggulim or towering yosher, the sacred fountain, ruins, and gardens. Until the 20th-century, however, scholarship read these works mostly as "Spanish" mysticism, alienated from its Andalusi roots. This comparative study deploys theological, historical, and textual analysis to dwell in one of these roots: the figure of the garden's vital element, water, as represented in the works of Teresa de Jesus and Ibn 'Arabi. The well-irrigated life written by these mystics underscores the significance of this element as a path to life, knowledge, and love of and by God. Bringing together scholarship on Christian and Sufi mysticism, and underscoring the centrality of movement, flow, and circulation, this article pieces together otherwise disparate readings of both the individual work of these two figures and their belonging in a canon of Andalusi/Spanish mysticism. The weaving of these threads will offer readers a different understanding of early modern religion, alongside traditional readings of Spain's mystical literature and its place in the global context.

AB  - Load currents and short-circuit currents in high-voltage power cable lines are sources of the induced voltages in the power cables' concentric metallic sheaths. When power cables operate with single-point bonding, which is the simplest bonding arrangement, these induced voltages may introduce an electric shock hazard or may lead to damage of the cables' outer non-metallic sheaths at the unearthed end of the power cable line. To avoid these aforementioned hazards, both-ends bonding of metallic sheaths is implemented but, unfortunately, it leads to increased power losses in the power cable line, due to the currents circulating through the sheaths. A remedy for the circulating currents is cross bonding-the most advanced bonding solution. Each solution has advantages and disadvantages. In practice, the decision referred to its selection should be preceded by a wide analysis. This paper presents a case study of the induced sheath voltages in a specific 110 kV power cable line. This power cable line is a specific one, due to the relatively low level of transferred power, much lower than the one resulting from the current-carrying capacity of the cables. In such a line, the induced voltages in normal operating conditions are on a very low level. Thus, no electric shock hazard exists and for this reason, the simplest arrangement-single-point bonding-was initially recommended at the project stage. However, a more advanced computer-based investigation has shown that in the case of the short-circuit conditions, induced voltages for this arrangement are at an unacceptably high level and risk of the outer non-metallic sheaths damage occurs. Moreover, the induced voltages during short circuits are unacceptable in some sections of the cable line even for both-ends bonding and cross bonding. The computer simulations enable to propose a simple practical solution for limiting these voltages. Recommended configurations of this power cable line-from the point of view of the induced sheath voltages and power losses-are indicated.

AB  - Muscle strength imbalances between the internal and external rotators of the shoulder are frequent in swimmers, but their role in shoulder injury remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of shoulder rotator strength and injury in elite adolescent swimmers. Eighteen adolescent swimmers performed preseason isokinetic tests of the internal and external rotator muscles in concentric (con) and eccentric (ecc) modes. Conventional (conER:conIR and eccER:eccIR) and functional ratios (eccER:conIR and eccIR:conER) were calculated. Thirteen swimmers completed a weekly questionnaire about swimming habits and shoulder injuries throughout the season. Preseason testing showed a significant negative association between the functional eccER:conIR ratio and years of practice (p < 0.05). Over the season, 46% of athletes experienced at least one shoulder injury. At the end of the season, peak torques increased for both internal and external rotator muscles strength, but only concentrically, resulting in a decrease in the eccER:conIR functional ratio (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis highlighted good predictive power for the preseason functional eccER:conlR ratio, as values below 0.68 were associated with a 4.5-fold (95% CI 1.33-15.28, p < 0.05) increased risk of shoulder injuries during the season.

AB  - We develop a framework that creates a new polygonal mesh representation of the sparse infill domain of a layer-by-layer 3D printing job. We guarantee the existence of a single, continuous tool path covering each connected piece of the domain in every layer in this graphical model. We also present a tool path algorithm that traverses each such continuous tool path with no crossovers.
   The key construction at the heart of our framework is a novel Euler transformation which converts a 2-dimensional cell complex K into a new 2-complex (K) over cap such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton (G) over cap of (K) over cap has even degree. Hence (G) over cap is Eulerian, and an Eulerian tour can be followed to print all edges in a continuous fashion without stops.
   We start with a mesh K of the union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. First we compute its Euler transformation (K) over cap. In the slicing step, we clip (K) over cap at each layer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler. We then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes created by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra support edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges without support in the next layer above. These support edges maintain the Euler nature of the complex. Finally, we describe a tree-based search algorithm that builds the continuous tool path by traversing "concentric'' cycles in the Euler complex. Our algorithm produces a tool path that avoids material collisions and crossovers, and can be printed in a continuous fashion irrespective of complex geometry or topology of the domain (e.g., holes).
   We implement our test our framework on several 3D objects. Apart from standard geometric shapes including a nonconvex star, we demonstrate the framework on the Stanford bunny. Several intermediate layers in the bunny have multiple components as well as complicated geometries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS

KW  - Continuum surgical robots
KW  - model predictive control
AB  - This article presents a model predictive controller (MPC) developed for the autonomous steering of concentric tube robots (CTRs). State-of-the-art CTR control relies on differential kinematics developed by local linearization of the CTRs mechanics model and cannot explicitly handle constraints on robot's joint limits or unstable configurations commonly known as snapping points. The proposed nonlinear MPC explicitly considers constraints on the robot configuration space (i.e., joint limits) and the robot's workspace (i.e., mixed boundary conditions on robot curvature). Additionally, the MPC calculates control decisions by optimizing the model-based predictions of future robot configurations. This way, it avoids configurations it cannot recover from, i.e., joint limits, singular configurations, and snapping. The proposed controller is evaluated via simulations and experimental studies with a variety of trajectories of increasing complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of MPC to avoid singularities while satisfying robot mechanical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution enables following of trajectories unattainable by state-of-the-art controllers with mean error corresponding to $1\%$ of robot arclength.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Butterfly wing color patterns are diverse, but they can be understood as modifications of the common scheme called the nymphalid groundplan. The discal spot is relatively small, but it is one of the important components of the nymphalid groundplan. Using many hindwing specimens of the family Nymphalidae, the morphological and spatial diversity of the discal spot was studied. The discal spot is expressed as a small or narrow spot, a pair of parallel bands, a diamond or oval structure, a large dark spot, a few fragmented spots, or a white structure. The discal spot is always located in a central portion of the wing defined by the wing veins, and this portion is sandwiched by a pair of bands of the central symmetry system, another important component of the nymphalid groundplan. On the basis of these results, the present study revises the nymphalid groundplan in minor points; the discal spot is an independent and diverse miniature symmetry system nested within the central symmetry system. Due to the involvement of wing veins to define the locations of the discal spot, the present study suggests the possible developmental dynamics of butterfly color pattern formation that produces color pattern diversity.
   Diverse butterfly wing color patterns are understood through the nymphalid groundplan, which mainly consists of central, border, and basal symmetry systems and a discal spot. However, the status of the discal spot remains unexplored. Here, the morphological and spatial diversity of the discal spot was studied in nymphalid hindwings. The discal spot is expressed as a small or narrow spot, a pair of parallel bands, a diamond or oval structure, a large dark spot, a few fragmented spots, or a white structure. In some cases, the discal spot is morphologically similar to and integrated with the central symmetry system (CSS). The discal spot is always located in a distal portion of the discal cell defined by the wing veins, which is sandwiched by the distal and proximal bands of the CSS (dBC and pBC) and is rarely occupied by border ocelli. The CSS occasionally has the central band (cBC), which differs from the discal spot. These results suggest that the discal spot is an independent and diverse miniature symmetry system nested within the CSS and that the locations of the discal spot and the CSS are determined by the wing veins at the early stage of wing development.

AB  - Recently, nonmetallic materials, which are resilient to corrosion, low cost, and lightweight, have been exploited in many industrial sectors such as oil and gas field. A common application of them is in the form of pipes. Despite the advantages, these pipes can be damaged by delamination, defects, holes, and erosion, which may lead to major production failures or even environmental catastrophes. To prevent these issues, nondestructive testing (NDT) of these pipes is required to replace these components in a timely manner. Due to the fact that the traditional NDT methods are mostly effective for metallic pipes, microwave holographic imaging is proposed for inspection of multiple concentric nonmetallic pipes. Besides, standardized minimum norm (SMN) is used to mitigate the depth biasing problem in the proposed imaging technique. To reduce the complexity of the imaging system, we aim at using the narrowest possible frequency band using an array of receiver antennas. The performance of the proposed NDT method is validated through simulation and experimental data in two scenarios including the antennas placed outside the pipes and inside the pipes.

AB  - An effective vibration control device, the pendulum tuned mass damper (P-TMD), can be easily realized as a mass supported on rolling or sliding pendulum bearings. While the bearings' concavity provides the desired gravitational restoring force, the necessary dissipative force can be obtained either from additional dampers installed in parallel with the bearings or from the same friction resistance developing within each bearing between the roller/slider and the rolling/sliding surface. The latter solution may prove cheaper and more compact but implies that the P-TMD effectiveness will be amplitude dependent if the friction coefficient is kept uniform along the rolling/sliding surface, as in conventional friction bearings. In this case, the friction P-TMD will be as efficient as a viscous P-TMD only at a given vibration level, with large performance reductions at other levels. To avoid this inconvenience, this paper proposes a new type of sliding variable friction pendulum (VFP) TMD, called the VFP-TMD, in which the sliding surface is divided into two concentric regions: a circular inner region, having the lowest possible friction coefficient and the same dimensions of the slider, and an annular outer region, having a friction coefficient set to an optimal value. A similar arrangement has been recently proposed to realize adaptive seismic isolation devices, but no specific application to TMDs is reported. To assess the VFP-TMD performance, first its analytical model is derived, rigorously accounting for geometric nonlinearities as well as for the variable (in time and space) pressure distribution along the contact area, and then, an optimal design methodology is presented. Finally, numerical simulations show the influence of the main design parameters on the device behavior and demonstrate that the VFP-TMD can achieve nearly the same effectiveness of viscous P-TMDs, while considerably outperforming conventional uniform-friction P-TMDs. The proposed analytical model can be used to enhance or validate existing models of VFP isolators that assume a constant and uniform contact pressure distribution.

AB  - Force-time (F-T) characteristics of countermovement jump (CMJ) are globally referenced as the main descriptors of athletic jump performance, particularly for volleyball players. Nevertheless, it is still unclear to what extent the vertical jump performance during testing is associated with jump performance during game-like conditions. This study was designed to investigate the association between F-T curve variables derived from CMJ, including movement timings, force, velocity, power, rate of force development (RFD), modified reactive strength index (RSImod), and net impulse with spike jump height during game-like circumstances. Thirteen young elite volleyball players performed three CMJs and six spike jumps in game-like circumstances. Pearson's product correlation test portrayed a significant correlation between spike jump height and peak RFD (r= 0.75), average RFD (r= 0.76), RSImod (r= 0.56), and concentric net impulse (r= 0.61). Multiple regression analysis also showed that these factors have a strong contribution for predicting spike jump heights (71%). The findings of this study emphasise the importance of RFD, concentric net impulse, and RSImod values in the precise analysis and prediction of volleyball attackers' spike jump height during game-like conditions.

AB  - The objective of the study is to investigate the relation between isokinetic knee strength and dynamic balance performance. 12 elite female volleyball players participated in the study voluntarily. The dominant and nondominant isokinetic leg strength, concentric extension and flexion of the participants were determined by means of an isokinetic dynamometer with the speed of 60 degrees s(-1), and the dynamic balance performance by isokinetic balance system. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relation between isokinetic leg strength and dynamic balance performance. As a result of the analysis, a negative significant relation was found between 60 degrees s(-1) angular speed quadriceps and hamstring muscle strengths and dynamic balance performance (p<0.05). In consequence of this study, it was determined that the increase in lower extremity isokinetic strength improved balance performance significantly. It is considered that this result can be an important factor in decreasing the risk of injuries in athletes and preventing performance losses. It can be stated that athletes should practice exercises improving the isokinetic strength of knee circumference muscles in order to increase dynamic balance performance that is one of the important factors in physical fitness parameters' performance in all branches of sports.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate the implications of the explicit brace-to-frame gusset connection modelling on the seismic performance assessment of steel concentrically-braced frames (CBFs). Two key modelling alternatives are considered, namely through the simulation of CBFs with: i) a benchmark experimentally-validated model, in which the gusset plates are explicitly designed and simulated; and ii) a more simplified option, whereby diagonals are simulated through a centreline-to-centreline approach with fully-pinned boundary conditions. Anticipating the consequences of a less refined modelling approach, a simplified regression-based design process to Eurocode 8 for these gusset connections is proposed, therefore avoiding the need for an explicit connection design for seismic assessment purposes. A third modelling option, an identical approach to the benchmark but with the gusset dimensions being determined through the aforementioned regression-based design process, is also considered. The importance of the explicit modelling of the gusset plate connections to obtain reliable estimates of seismic performance is shown through the comparison of the seismic performance of various building archetypes, considering different metrics (e.g. lateral deformations, earthquake-induced collapse risk and economic losses). Furthermore, the validity of the proposed gusset-design methodology is discussed, by comparing the resulting gusset dimensions against those associated with a rigorous seismic design process, as well as by comparing the seismic performance assessed with numerical models incorporating explicitly-designed or simplified-designed gusset geometries.

AB  - Compared with the mesh-based numerical calculation method, the meshless methods avoid the problems caused by geometric topology, nodal numbering and information transmission of discrete meshes or nodes, which shows significant advantages in solving the problems of complex computing domain boundaries, phase transformation, interface tracking, and crack propagation. Based on the moving least squares approximation and variational principles, a two-dimensional element-free Galerkin (EFG) model for heat transfer/solidification behavior of continuous casting round billets is derived and established in this work. Taking the measured heat flux as the boundary conditions, the non-uniform solidification behavior of the round billet is calculated and analyzed. The essential issues that affect the suitability and calculation accuracy of the meshless model are discussed, such as the nodal arrangement and the size of the supporting domain. The "concentric circle" nodal arrangement scheme in rectangular coordinate system is proposed, and the results show this scheme can conveniently deal with the problem of curve boundary and the solidified shell movement of round billet, showing great flexibility in node arrangement. When the supporting domain size is adopted to be 1.7 times of the average nodal spacing, the calculation accuracy is high under the regular and random nodal arrangement schemes. The results verify the feasibility and accuracy of EFG meshless model in the calculation of non-uniform heat transfer and solidification of billet. It shows a significant advantage in the phase transformation interface tracking, and provides a theoretical foundation for subsequent research on themio-mechanical coupling and crack prediction analysis.

AB  - In advanced designs of DEMO breeding blankets with ceramic breeder, the structural material EUROFER is in direct contact with the pebbles of the ceramic breeder (Li4SiO4 + Li2TiO3) that results in a loss of constituent elements in the ceramic and the formation of a corrosion layer on EUROFER under operation relevant condi-tions. The impact of this corrosion attack on damage mechanisms which are significantly influenced by microstructural changes at the surface, in particular fatigue, needs to be considered in the design of affected components and is therefore investigated within the work reported here.
   Fatigue specimens made out of EUROFER in unconstrained contact to ceramic breeder pebbles were exposed to purge gas conditions for different durations. The chemical surface attack observed after the exposure is characterized by round stains, partly even round dimples, consisting of concentric diffusion zones which meet in case of the long exposure time forming an almost closed corrosion multi-layer. The impact of this attack on the fatigue behavior was subsequently investigated by performing strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests at 550 degrees C. To cover the scatter expected for the fatigue lifetime, a sufficient number of LCF experiments were conducted. The results show significant reduction of the fatigue lifetime, which quantitatively depends on the level of the attack/exposure time as well as the level of the applied load/strain amplitude.

AB  - To create approximately spherical structures with curved sidewalls, this paper presents a method for building a series of decreasing slopes along the sidewall of a circular truncated cone. The multistep ring-edge etching technology of first reducing the concentric mask and then cutting the top off to create a mesa shape can be used to form the slopes. This wet-etching method avoids the constraints of crystallographic properties with surfactant-added Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), enabling the manufacture of successive given inclination angles, the precise modulation of the spherical curvature by reduction design of concentric masks, and the setting of etching time. The newly approximated spherical Si microstructure patterns can be used for microlenses, quartz crystal resonators, micropulleys, and other applications. The present research is an approach to fabricate advanced microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) curved-surface structures, extending the range of 3D structures fabricated by silicon wet etching.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the differences between performing Nordic hamstring exercises once or twice a week on hamstring eccentric strength and other muscle-strain risk factors in high-level football players. Methods: In this randomized trial, 32 football players (18-23 y old) completed an 8-week Nordic hamstring exercise training program in 1 of 2 experimental groups: group I (once a week; n = 15) and group 2 (twice a week; n = 17). Knee-flexor/extensor peak torques and biceps femoris long-head muscle architecture were assessed through isokinetic dynamometry and ultrasonography, respectively, before and after the training programs. Analysis of covariance, effect sizes (ESs), and t tests for percentage change were used to assess the effect of the 2 interventions on the outcome measures. Results: Group 2 demonstrated higher hamstring concentric peak torque than group 1 posttraining (155-164 vs 149-158 N.m; P = .043; ES = 0.27), although there was also a statistical trend for higher hamstring eccentric peak torque (212-234 vs 198-221 N.m; P= .098; ES = 0.37), hamstring-to-quadriceps conventional ratio (0.56-0.59 vs 0.54-0.57; P= .089; ES = 0.31), and hamstring-to-quadriceps functional ratio (0.76-0.84 vs 0.71-0.79; P= .076; ES = 0.50). No between-groups differences were found for muscle thickness (P = .864; ES = 0.12). pennation angle (P = .289; ES = 0.18), fascicle length (P = .406; ES = 0.03), and quadriceps concentric peak torque (P = .340; ES = 0.02). Conclusion: Only the Nordic hamstring exercise training program performed twice a week strengthened the hamstrings of high-level football players, while similar changes in muscle architecture occurred with both once- and twice-weekly sessions.

AB  - Purpose To define based on expert opinion and practical experience using a systematic and scientific approach, (1) the perceived most effective exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injury in elite footballers; and, (2) when and how these exercise programs are prescribed based on the number of days between games i.e. implementation strategy. Methods A Delphi survey obtained opinions and assessed for agreement. Delphi respondents consisted of 21 experienced sports practitioners (12 +/- 5.3 years in elite football and with an academic background) belonging to 18 teams from the Big-5 European football leagues; England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain. Three teams were represented collaboratively by two experts. The Delphi process involves sequential rounds each evolving based on the responses from the previous. The number of rounds is not pre-defined and continues until an agreement is either achieved or it is clear that no agreement will be reached. Frequency of responses was recorded where the agreement was sought (i.e. in closed questions) and an agreement was achieved if >= 13/18 (70%) respondents agreed. For open-ended questions, a qualitative content analysis was performed to identify recurring themes and when themes were specified by >= 13 (70%), these were also considered as reaching an agreement. Practitioners had the opportunity to raise concerns if they disagreed with the 'agreement from recurrent themes'. Results There were four Delphi rounds (100% response for each round). Sprinting and High-Speed Running (HSR) focused exercises were agreed as most effective (perceived) to prevent muscle injuries. Eccentric exercise was perceived as the next most effective. It was agreed that sprinting and HSR be integrated into coaches training, and target 100% of players worst-case match scenario (e.g. volume, intensity) based on individual maximum speeds. Eccentric exercise was recommended to be implemented according to the context of the main football session and planned/actual sprinting and HSR content. It was agreed that eccentrics can be performed before or after training, context dependent. The day to perform specific sprinting and HSR or eccentric exercises depended on the proximity of previous and upcoming matches. Other exercises reaching agreement as 'somewhat effective' included concentric and isometric, horizontal and vertical plyometrics, coordination, core and dynamic flexibility in addition to core stability. No agreement was reached for multi-joint, resisted sprinting, kicking or agility exercises nor simultaneous single-leg strength and stability. Finally, no agreement was reached regarding programming variables e.g. sets, repetitions as deemed too contextual. Conclusion Regarding exercise-based strategies, particular importance agreed by the Delphi expert group was to focus on sprinting, HSR and eccentric exercises, integrated with a variety of other exercise modes which also carry some level of effectiveness in a multidimensional programme. Context was agreed to be key and decision-making about when to undertake/ how to prescribe exercise strategies to be made according to the content of normal football training and the proximity of matches.

AB  - Isokinetic strength screening is utilized in professional soccer. However, there has been little research on the interaction between seasonal changes in players' peak torque (PT) and injury incidence. Twenty-five (age 16.5 +/- 0.68 years) professional youth soccer players participated in the study. Bilateral isokinetic concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) testing of Quadriceps (Q) and Hamstrings (H) were conducted at three time-points across the season. Absolute CON and ECC PT were measured at 60 degree/sec and in a supine 170-degree position. Testing data was normalized to body mass. A mixed design (2 by 3) repeated measures ANOVA with injury as a co-variate was conducted to evaluate the effect of season and/or limb dominance on PT and injury incidence. With regard to the seasonal variation and injury incidence, an interaction was identified with respect to non-dominant limb (NDL) QCON (p = 0.01) and to a lesser extent the dominant limb (DL) QCON (p = 0.05). The seasonal variation of the PT of the NDL QCON was different between the injured and non-injured individuals. Non-injured individuals, QCON strength increased over the course of the season. While for the Injured players, QCON declined from pre-season to mid-season then increased but never recovered to starting pre-season values.

AB  - The rise of world Englishes has challenged the emphasis on native-speaker accents and cultures in English language teaching. This study aimed to investigate the representation of world Englishes and cultures in three global language teaching textbooks, namely Interchange, English Result, and American English File. The textbooks were subjected to content analysis regarding their reference to Inner, Outer, and Expanding Circles' varieties and their associated cultural contents. Kachru (The alchemy of English: The spread functions and models of non-native Englishes. Oxford: Pergamon, 1986) notion of Concentric Circles, and the categorization proposed by Pfister and Borzelli (Unterrichtspraxis 10:102-108, 1977) functioned as a framework to see which aspects of each culture (social, personal, religion/arts/humanities, political systems and institutions, and environmental concerns) were addressed in these textbooks. Findings revealed that most of the references to the three circles and cultural elements embodied in the textbooks were toward Inner Circle countries in American English File. Furthermore, in Interchange and English Result series, reference to Outer and Expanding Circles' varieties and cultural elements were comparatively more evident. However, all the three textbook series mostly represented Inner-Circle accents. These findings have implications for materials developers to adopt an EIL-aware approach and to avoid the sole representation of native speakers' linguistic norms and cultures in ELT textbooks.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the influence of hamstrings and quadriceps strength on the hamstrings-to-quadriceps conventional (H:Q(con)) and functional (H:Q(fun)) ratios in male soccer players. Quadriceps concentric peak torque (PT) and hamstrings concentric and eccentric PT were assessed with isokinetic dynamometry at 60 degrees/s in 101 players (202 legs). The cut-points of 0.50, 0.55 and 0.60 were used to assess muscle imbalance through the H:Q(con)ratio, while 0.80, 0.85 and 0.90 were used for H:Q(fun)ratio. Legs with lower H:Q(con)ratio had decreased hamstrings concentric PT (p < 0.01; moderate and large effect sizes) and increased quadriceps concentric PT (p < 0.01; moderate effect sizes) in all cut-points. Legs with lower H:Q(fun)ratio had decreased hamstrings eccentric PT (p < 0.01; large effect sizes) for all cut-points, and controversial results for quadriceps concentric PT (p < 0.01 only for 0.80 cut-point; small effect sizes). H:Q(con)ratio presented only weak correlations with quadriceps (r = -0.37) and hamstrings (r = 0.45) concentric PT, while H:Q(fun)ratio had a negligible correlation with quadriceps concentric PT (r = -0.30) and a moderate correlation with hamstrings eccentric PT (r = 0.66). In conclusion, our findings support that hamstrings strength deficit is the key factor for low H:Q ratios in male soccer players, especially those with poor H:Q(fun)ratio.

AB  - 'Ground effect' refers to the enhanced performance enjoyed by fliers or swimmers operating close to the ground. We derive a number of exact solutions for this phenomenon, thereby elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms involved in ground effect. Unlike previous analytic studies, our solutions are not restricted to particular parameter regimes, such as 'weak' or 'extreme' ground effect, and do not even require thin aerofoil theory. Moreover, the solutions are valid for a hitherto intractable range of flow phenomena, including point vortices, uniform and straining flows, unsteady motions of the wing, and the Kutta condition. We model the ground effect as the potential flow past a wing inclined above a flat wall. The solution of the model requires two steps: firstly, a coordinate transformation between the physical domain and a concentric annulus; and secondly, the solution of the potential flow problem inside the annulus. We show that both steps can be solved by introducing a new special function which is straightforward to compute. Moreover, the ensuing solutions are simple to express and offer new insight into the mathematical structure of ground effect. In order to identify the missing physics in our potential flow model, we compare our solutions against new experimental data. The experiments show that boundary layer separation on the wing and wall occurs at small angles of attack, and we suggest ways in which our model could be extended to account for these effects.

AB  - This study used wireless technology to investigate joint kinematic characteristics of the four alpine skiing disciplines. Knee and hip angles were measured in 20 national team alpine skiers during 253 ski runs under FIS regulation, including: 85 Slalom (SL), 123 Giant Slalom (GS), 29 Super Giant Slalom (SG), and 16 Downhill (DH). Data were analyzed by outside (OL, n = 2,087) and inside leg (IL, n = 2,015). The proportion of concentric and eccentric phases (extension and flexion respectively for the knee extensors) as well as the proportion of the quasi-isometric phase defined between & PLUSMN;20 & DEG;.s(-1) depended on the discipline in interaction with the IL/OL (p < 0.001). The results showed a lower knee quasi-isometric duration on OL in SL (11%) than other disciplines (DH: 38%; SG: 42%; GS: 34%, p < 0.001, d > 1.8), suggesting a highly dynamic style. Quasi-isometric mode was significantly longer on OL than IL in GS (34 vs. 20%, p < 0.001, d = 1.16) and SG (42 vs. 28%, p < 0.001, d = 1.11) but was significantly longer on IL than OL in SL (19 vs. 11%, p < 0.001, d = 0.64). Thus, GS and SG showed similarities, with a significantly faster knee eccentric mean angular velocity on IL compared to OL (GS -58 vs. -54 & DEG;.s(-1), SG -52 vs. -45 & DEG;.s(-1), p < 0.001, d & GE; 0.22) whereas SL showed an opposite pattern (-72 vs. -89 & DEG;.s(-1), p < 0.001, d = 1.10). The quasi-isometric phase was overlooked in previous studies but is crucial to consider. The current data may be used to train the outside and inside leg specificities incorporating discipline-specific contraction modes and exercises.</p>

AB  - Context Theoretical models propose that the spatial extent at which landscape structure best predicts species responses (scale of effect, SoE) depends on habitat and dietary specialization, landscape metrics, and response variables. However, empirical support for such models is scarce, especially for apex predators. Objectives To determine SoE for diurnal raptors, and test for differences among ecological traits of habitat and dietary specialization, landscape metrics, and response variables. Methods We conducted 1.5 km transect surveys of diurnal raptors at 26 sites in a tropical dry forest from western Mexico. We measured four landscape metrics (forest cover, matrix hardness, forest patch density, edge density) in 16 concentric landscapes (400 to 3400 ha) around each survey site. We then assessed the landscape size at which each landscape metric best predicted each response variable (abundance, species richness, temporal beta diversity). Finally, we tested for differences in SoE among ecological traits of raptors, landscape metrics, and response variables. Results Landscape composition metrics of forest cover and matrix hardness decreased with increasing landscape size, and were the main landscape predictors influencing diurnal raptors. SoE differed significantly among landscape metrics, being larger for forest cover (2433.3 ha) than matrix hardness (1500 ha). However, SoE did not differ significantly among ecological traits of raptors, or response variables. Conclusions SoE was mainly driven by spatial metrics, with diurnal raptors being more strongly associated with forest cover measured over larger scales. This supports findings for other taxa and suggests that forest cover influences dispersal success across larger scales.

AB  - Concentric tube robots, composed of nested pre-curved tubes, have the potential to perform minimally invasive surgery at difficult-to-reach sites in the human body. In order to plan motions that safely perform surgeries in constrained spaces that require avoiding sensitive structures, the ability to accurately estimate the entire shape of the robot is needed. Many state-of-the-art physics-based shape models are unable to account for complex physical phenomena and subsequently are less accurate than is required for safe surgery. In this work, we present a learned model that can estimate the entire shape of a concentric tube robot. The learned model is based on a deep neural network that is trained using a mixture of simulated and physical data. We evaluate multiple network architectures and demonstrate the model's ability to compute the full shape of a concentric tube robot with high accuracy.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the differences in power production between movement phases (i.e., concentric and eccentric) during the execution of resistance exercises with a flywheel device, differentiating between execution regimes (i.e., bilateral, unilateral dominant leg and unilateral non-dominant leg). Twenty young elite soccer players (U-17) performed two sets of six repetitions of the bilateral half-squat (inertia 0.025 kg.m(-2)) and the lateral-squat exercise (inertia 0.010 kg.m(-2)) on a flywheel device. During the testing sessions, mean and peak power in concentric (MPcon) and eccentric (MPecc) phases were recorded. The non-dominant leg showed higher values in all power variables measured, although substantial differences were only found in MPecc (ES = 0.40, likely) and PPcon (ES = 0.36, possibly). On the other hand, for both exercises, MPcon was higher than MPecc (ES = -0.57 to -0.31, possibly/likely greater), while only PPecc was higher than PPcon in the dominant lateral-squat (ES = 0.44, likely). These findings suggest that young soccer players have difficulty in reaching eccentric-overload during flywheel exercises, achieving it only with the dominant leg. Therefore, coaches should propose precise preventive programs based on flywheel devices, attending to the specific characteristics of each limb, as well as managing other variables to elicit eccentric-overload.

AB  - Phosphorus fertilizer use efficiency can be poor in calcareous soils as a result of calcium phosphate precipitation reactions. To avoid crop P deficiency, growers may apply more fertilizer than is agronomically necessary, creating a surplus of P in soil that can erode or leach into nearby waterbodies and promote eutrophication. This study investigated the effects of liquid P fertilizer source, application volume, and co-application of a gelling agent on P partitioning in two mildly calcareous soils from Kansas. Treatments included phosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and an 80% MAP/20% APP mixture applied at one total P rate over two concentrations or co-applied with sodium alginate (AG). Soils were incubated for 4 wk in Petri dishes and then sectioned in concentric rings from the point of application. Anion exchange resin (AER) extractability assessed plant availability and total P determination evaluated diffusion. Sequential extraction and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were implemented to probe reaction products and pathways. Incorporation of polyphosphates, co-application of AG, and dilution with water improved the proportion of P that was AER extractable in the case of monoammonium phosphate from similar to 36 to 66, 58, and 65%, respectively. Increased plant availability may be accomplished through a combination of at least two mechanisms: retarded ripening of calcium phosphate minerals into sparingly soluble forms and altered partitioning of P to soil colloids. Understanding the conditions under which these concepts scale to the field could result in increased farm profitability and nutrient use efficiency.

AB  - The present study assessed the effects of ethanol exposure during adolescence or adulthood. We exposed Wistar rats, males or females, to self-administered 8-10% (v/v) ethanol (BINGE group) during the first 2 h of the dark cycle, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) during postnatal days (PDs) 32-54 or 72-94 (adolescent and adults, respectively). During this period, controls were only handled, and a third (IP) condition was given ethanol intraperitoneal administrations, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), at doses that matched those self-administered by the BINGE group. The rats were tested for ethanol intake and preference in a two-bottle (24 h long) choice test, shortly before (PD 30 or 70) and shortly after (PD 56 or 96) exposure to the binge or intraperitoneal protocol; and then tested for free-choice drinking during late adulthood (PDs 120-139) in intermittent two-bottle intake tests. Binge drinking was significantly greater in adolescents vs. adults, and was blocked by naloxone (5.0 mg/kg) administered immediately before the binge session. Mean blood ethanol levels (mg/dl) at termination of binge session 3 were 60.82 +/- 22.39. Ethanol exposure at adolescence, but not at adulthood, significantly reduced exploration of an open field-like chamber and significantly increased shelter-seeking behavior in the multivariate concentric square field. The rats that had been initially exposed to ethanol at adolescence drank, during the intake tests conducted at adulthood, significantly more than those that had their first experience with ethanol at adulthood, an effect that was similar among BINGE, IP and control groups. The study indicates that binge ethanol drinking is greater in adolescent that in adults and is associated with heightened ethanol intake at adulthood. Preventing alcohol access to adolescents should reduce the likelihood of problematic alcohol use or alcohol-related consequences.

AB  - Muscle strength imbalances and poor flexibility are frequently described as risk factors for hamstring injury. Preventive strategies include eccentric exercises, but the influence of field eccentric exercises on these risk factors remains unclear. We investigated the influence of a field hamstring eccentric program on hamstring strength and flexibility. Twenty-seven amateur athletes were randomly assigned to an intervention (n=13) or control group (n=14). In the intervention group, participants were involved in 15 sessions of four eccentric exercises. Peak torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios, passive and active flexibility were analyzed. No significant modifications of strength, passive or active flexibility were observed in the control group (p>0.05). Hamstring eccentric peak torque (+7.1%) and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (9.3%) were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the intervention group, but not concentric strength (p<0.05). Passive straight leg raise was significantly increased by 11.4 degrees (+12.7%, p<0.001), but not active flexibility (+3.1%, p>0.05). In conclusion, a 6-week eccentric program, including four field exercises for hamstring muscles, is an effective method of improving eccentric strength, functional ratios and, especially, passive flexibility. As this program may be easily implemented in a real-world context, this association of multiple eccentric exercises might be useful in an injury prevention strategy.

AB  - Campylobacter is highly diverse genetically and also undergoes frequent intraspecific recombination. A major source of campylobacteriosis, which is transmitted to humans is found in poultry. The assessment of the genetic diversity among Campylobacter population is critical to our understanding of the epidemiology. The genetic diversity of Campylobacter jejuni isolates in broilers and their environment were investigated by fiaA-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The study revealed that 92.3% of the examined broiler flocks were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. A total number of 35 different flaA types defined by flaA-RFLP were found in 448 C. jejuni isolates originated from broilers, litter, puddles, zones, anteroom and wild birds. The most dominant flaA type was XXV. MLST defined 20 sequence types (STs) belonging to 10 clonal complexes (CCs). Among all the STs 9 isolates (15%) were consigned to 2 different STs (ST-7413 and ST-4800), which could not be assigned. The most common CO were ST-21 and ST-179. The ST-21 CC was common in broilers and environment (puddle water and concentric zones) and the ST-179 CC was specific to wild birds, but also was found in puddle water and concentric zones.

AB  - The phase diagram of equimolar blends of AB and CD diblock copolymers has been studied using dissipative particle dynamics. All unlike blocks interacted with the same chi, except for the B-C interaction, for which chi(BC) < 0 in order to prevent macrophase separation. The BC interaction was able to prevent macrophase separation except for low volume fractions of B and C (phi(BC) less than or similar to 0.1) and relatively equal fractions of A and D. For high phi(BC) (phi(BC) greater than or similar to 0.92), a disordered state was obtained. For all microphase separated states the shapes/morphologies were described by the ratios of the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration tensor and their sphericity. These were used to classify the domains as forming sphere, cylinders, lamellae, or branched/gyroidal structures. For phi(BC) < 0.5 the BC domains acted as an interfacial region which compatibilized the A and D domains, while for phi(BC) > 0.5 the BC domain filled in the space between A and D domains. Several interesting structures were formed including a novel connected/branched spheres morphology, hierarchical lamellae, concentric spheres/cylinders, and a combination of cylinders/lamellae. Comparisons are made with the linear diblock and linear triblock phase diagrams.

AB  - Compared with mesh-based numerical approaches, the meshless methods avoid complex topology and transmission of nodal information, which shows remarkable advantages in solving the problems of phase-transition interface tracking, curved boundary and crack propagation. In this paper, the discrete governing equations of heat transfer/solidification for the round billet are deduced and constructed based on Element-free Galerkin method. Using the measured non-uniform heat flux to impose the Neumann boundary conditions, a 2D cross-section computational model is developed to simulate and investigate the non-uniform solidification behavior of round billet. In the computational model, the essential issues such as time discretization scheme, time step length, nodal arrangement and their effects on the simulation accuracy as well as stability are specified. To verify the influence and flexibility of node layout in the meshless method model, the present work explores a concentric circular nodal arrangement scheme and determines a reasonable range of nodal spacing. The result has revealed that the meshless method could be employed successfully in exploring the non-uniform solidification behavior of continuous casting billet, which provides a foundation for further research on thermo-mechanical and cracks propagation analysis.

AB  - Rationale Social attachment plays an important role in offspring development. Different parenting experiences during lactation may shape offspring behavior and later alcohol use. Objectives We tested the hypothesis that differential rearing conditions (single mother, SM or biparental, BP) in the non-monogamous C57BL/6J mice may affect (1) parental behavior during lactation, (2) adolescent behavior, and (3) adolescent initiation of alcohol drinking. Methods Mice were reared in SM or BP (cohabitation of father-mother since copulation) condition until weaning (postnatal day, PND, 21). Litters from both conditions were filmed during PNDs 6, 9, and 12 and an ethogram was made taking into account nest-, pup-, or self-directed behaviors. At PNDs, 28-29 adolescent animals were evaluated in a modified version of the concentric square field for measurement of behavioral patterns. Other groups of adolescents were tested in a 4-h daily, two-bottle choice alcohol consumption test (10% alcohol vs. water) during 3 weeks (4 days per week). Results Single mothers spent less time in the nest, left unattended the nest more times, displayed more self-directed and less pup-directed behaviors than BP parents. SM-reared adolescents displayed more anxiogenic-like and less risk-associated behaviors than BP counterparts. The alcohol consumption test indicated a strong effect of rearing condition. Since the fifth day of test, SM adolescents consumed more quantities of alcohol than BP adolescents. Conclusions During single-mother parenting, pups are left unattended more often, and during adolescence, these organisms exhibited increased anxiety responses. This behavioral phenotype may act as a risk factor for alcohol initiation during adolescence.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of the role of fungi in prehistoric human societies and, in particular, to determine their use as tinder in fire-lighting technologies. The case of La Draga (Banyoles, NE Spain), an Early Neolithic site with extraordinary conservation of organic materials, is presented. At this site, a well preserved and abundant assemblage of fruiting bodies of fungi has been recovered in a waterlogged environment. The comparison of the taxa identified with evidence of fungal spores is analysed in order to provide a better understanding of the process of fungi incorporation into the archaeological site. Finds at La Draga demonstrate that the gathering of bracket fungi was a frequent practice during the Early Neolithic occupation. A total of 86 fruiting bodies have been studied and six different taxa have been identified: Ganoderma adspersum, Daldinia concentrica, Daedalea quercina, Lenzites warnieri, Coriolopsis gallica, and Skeletocutis nivea. The taxa identified in the fruiting bodies have not been identified among the fungal spores from the soil sediments. Comparison of the presence of fungal spores and fruiting bodies provides additional arguments to support the hypothesis that bracket fungi were gathered, dried and stored to be used by the inhabitants of La Draga.

AB  - Background:
   The incidence rate of elbow injuries has been rising in recent years among professional baseball pitchers. Determining valid screening procedures that allow practitioners to identify pitchers at an increased risk of such injuries is therefore of critical importance.
   Purpose:
   To validate the use of countermovement jump (CMJ) tests as a diagnostic tool for pitcher conditioning.
   Study Design:
   Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   More than 500 pitchers at a single professional baseball organization performed preseason CMJ assessments on a force plate before the 2013 to 2018 seasons. Three measurements were extracted from ground-reaction force data during the test: eccentric rate of force development (ERFD), average vertical concentric force (AVCF), and concentric vertical impulse (CVI). Athletic trainers at the organization collected detailed information on elbow and shoulder injury rates as well as workload (pitch count) throughout the rest of the season. Poisson regression models were fit to investigate the dependency of injury rates on CMJ test performance.
   Results:
   ERFD, CVI, and AVCF were all significant predictors of elbow injury risk after accounting for pitcher age, weight, and workload. The analysis identified 3 specific indicators of heightened risk based on the results of a CMJ scan: low ERFD, a combination of low AVCF and high CVI, and a combination of high AVCF and low CVI. In contrast, shoulder injury risk was roughly independent of all 3 CMJ test measurements.
   Conclusion:
   This study supports the hypothesis of the entire kinetic chain's involvement in pitching by establishing a link between CMJ test performance and elbow injury risk in professional baseball pitchers. CMJ assessment may be a powerful addition to injury risk alert and prevention protocols. Pitchers in high-risk groups can be prescribed specific exercise plans to improve movement imbalances.

AB  - By means of a hypergraph, we study the resilience and the connectivity of a socio-ecological system (SES), which takes the form of a concentric diagram reflecting strong sustainability. The structure is subjected to dynamics of spread of a global reform. The model outcomes reveal that, in the concentric representation of sustainability, the environmental layer is endowed with the maximum magnitude of efficiency of the knock-on effect. The existence of risk of reform abrogation prevents the equilibrium density of reformed nodes from reaching stationarity. The numerical simulation results confirm that the environmental layer is the most efficient when it comes to launching a reform through a small number of nodes. They also show that connectivity between all types of elements is most fairly valued from the environmental perspective. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was use surface EMG activity to assess changes in co-activation of knee flexors and extensors muscle groups during elastic-band exercise after 5 weeks of high-velocity elastic-band training in basketball players.
   METHODS: College male basketball players (N.=18) were randomly divided into one of two groups: 1) the elastic-band training group performed low-load and high-velocity - lying prone - hamstring curls training three times per week; 2) the control group did not do any training. Pre- and post- training assessment included concentric knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees/s and 240 degrees/s, and the frequency of knee flexion and extension with elastic bands in the prone position. The EMG of the rectus femoris, semitendinosus muscles and the long head of the biceps femoris were assessed during these activities, and 30-m sprint running speed was measured from a stationary start and a running start.
   RESULTS: It was shown that high-velocity elastic-band training was 1) feasible, 2) increased movement velocity and 3) muscle strength, 4) altered neural control such that excessive lengthening of the hamstring muscle, and hence strain-injuries, may be prevented and 5) improved sprint performance in basketball players.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high-velocity elastic-band training may be a tool to prevent hamstring strain-injuries in basketball players.

AB  - A method based on elastic stability analysis to design bolted single shear lap (SSL) connections, which are traditionally used for hollow structural section (HSS) bracing members, is proposed in this paper. The method includes connections with different lap plate thicknesses. An approximate nonlinear analysis method is also presented to mimic the inelastic buckling and post-buckling response of the connections. These approaches are validated by the existing experimental results of three X-bracing specimens and by the numerical results obtained from nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. The results show that the design procedure proposed by the current guidelines for the HSS can be improved using the calculated effective length factor of this study. Lastly, a stiffened SSL connection detail is suggested for X-bracings and is assessed through the employed analytical methods. This detail is efficiently able to prevent the formation of the three-hinge buckling mode in SSL connections by omitting one of the involved plastic hinges. By using this detail, the compression strength of the connections is enhanced to a level that is normally demanded by special concentric braced frames (SCBF).

AB  - Plasticity is often regarded as a derived adaptation to help organisms survive in variable but predictable environments, however, we currently lack a rigorous, mechanistic examination of how plasticity evolves in a large comparative framework. Here, we show that phenotypic plasticity in eyespot size in response to environmental temperature observed in Bicyclus anynana satyrid butterflies is a complex derived adaptation of this lineage. By reconstructing the evolution of known physiological and molecular components of eyespot size plasticity in a comparative framework, we showed that 20E titer plasticity in response to temperature is a pre-adaptation shared by all butterfly species examined, whereas expression of EcR in eyespot centers, and eyespot sensitivity to 20E, are both derived traits found only in a subset of species with eyespots.

AB  - It has been suggested that eccentric contraction (EC) is associated with increases in serially arranged sarcomeres (sarcomerogenesis), while concentric contraction (CC) has been associated with serial sarcomeres decrease. Sarcomerogenesis following EC is thought to be a protective muscle adaptation, preventing muscle injury in future eccentric exercise bouts (repeated bout effect). However, the mechanisms underlying sarcomerogenesis in EC remain unknown, and the sarcomerogenic responses observed in response to EC and CC are contradictory. We measured sarcomere length, sarcomere length uniformity, serial sarcomere number, and fascicle length in gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in sedentary (SED) mice, and in mice following protocols of moderate uphill (TRU) and downhill (TRD) training and uphill (OTU) and downhill (OTD) overtraining. We found pain sensitivity after the first bout of EC exercise on TRD and OTD followed by a normalized sensory response after four weeks of training, indicating a repeated bout effect. However, these findings were not associated with sarcomerogenesis, as serial sarcomere numbers did not increase in TRD and OTD skeletal muscle samples compared to controls (SED). However, we found a decrease in serial sarcomere number in VL and TA in OTU group mice, which was associated with a decrease in fascicle length and no change of sarcomere length at the tested joint configuration. We conclude that excessive concentric muscle contraction (OTU group mice), leads to a decrease in serial sarcomere number, while moderate or excessive eccentric training, did not result in sarcomerogenesis, as reported in the literature.

AB  - Steel multi tiered concentrically braced frames (MT-CBFs) are commonly used in North America as a lateral load resisting system of tall single story buildings. Past studies show that MT-CBF columns designed in accordance with the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions are prone to buckling due to a high axial compression force combined with in plane bending moments caused by the nonuniform distribution of inelastic brace deformations along the frame height. Special design provisions have been introduced in the 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions to address flexural demands imposed on MT-CBF columns and prevent column instability. In this paper, the seismic design methods for multi-tiered special concentrically braced frames are evaluated using the nonlinear finite element analysis method. A two-tiered special concentrically braced frame was then created, and nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were performed to evaluate the seismic performance of both frames. Analysis results confirmed that the inelastic deformations in the frame designed using the 2010 requirements are not uniformly distributed but rather concentrated in one of the tiers and cause column instability under large story drifts, whereas, the 2016 design method significantly improves the distribution of inelastic deformation along the height of the frame and prevents column instability. Furthermore, it was found that the 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions accurately estimate the axial load but overestimate the in-plane flexural demands and underestimates the out-of-plane flexural demand. Nonetheless, the overestimation of in plane flexure demands results in acceptable strength capacity even though out-of-plane flexural demands is underestimated.

AB  - The newly emerged hybrid manufacturing platform that incorporates both additive manufacturing (AM) and five-axis machining modules makes it possible to manufacture parts of complex shapes with high finish-surface quality that are impossible to be produced solely by either machining or additive manufacturing. In general, a hybrid manufacturing process is signified by an alternating sequence of AM operations and machining operations that alternatingly build and machine an inprocess workpiece into the final design shape. Aside from other considerations, collision avoidance between the in-process workpiece and both the cutting tool and the material-dispensing nozzle is one of the most critical constraints that affect the determination of the alternating sequence. Due to the newness of hybrid manufacturing technology, currently there has been few systematic studies of this collision avoidance problem in which the obstacles are in a constant state of growing, especially on nozzle collision avoidance which - though never an issue in the traditional 2.5-axis AM because the in-process workpiece is always below the printing nozzle - now becomes a real concern in hybrid manufacturing as the in-process workpiece now dynamically grows and is not constrained by the current build layer. The nozzle collision problem is particularly pronounced in metallic hybrid manufacturing where the nozzle compartment typically is large and has a complex shape. In this paper, we conduct a thorough study of this collision avoidance problem in hybrid manufacturing and present a deterministic algorithm for automatically generating a collision-free sequence of hybrid manufacturing with the least alternations for a solid part. Specifically, as long as the part can be represented in the so-called columnar form, and the build layers are either planar or on concentric conic surfaces, for any given tool and nozzle, our algorithm will automatically generate an alternating sequence of minimum length whose corresponding hybrid manufacturing process is guaranteed to be free of collision with either the tool or nozzle The columnar representation actually embodies a large class of industrial parts such as aero-engine blisks and gears while concentric conic build layers are the most common type of slicing strategy adopted in multi-axis 3D printing. Ample computer simulation tests of the proposed algorithm are performed and the results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Steel braced frames are among the most effective lateral load resisting systems. The eccentrically braced frame has a higher ductility, less stiffness, and a better serviceability (limited retrofitting needed after the seismic excitations) compared to concentrically braced ones. Static indeterminacy is generally considered as the number of extra constraints or members in a structural system. In other words, redundancy is the ability of a structure to keep its stability after the onset of the failure or removal of its lateral load resisting elements, preventing it from collapse in the initial stages of loading. The redundancy of a system depends on the "dynamic" characteristics of its structure and properties of the applied earthquake excitations as well as its structural geometric features and details. This indeterminacy is called dynamic redundancy.
   In this study, the effects of the number and location of braced bays on redundancy were investigated to obtain the best pattern for regular 5 and 8-story buildings using nonlinear analysis. It also develops a relationship for the redundancy factor of the dual structural systems. Results show that position of braced bays is more effective on redundancy than the number of bays. It is also concluded that the building's height affects the required number of bracing bays. The study also showed that the dynamic redundancy is different from the over-strength. According to the results of this research, for dual structural systems, it is recommended not to arrange the braces only in the perimeter of the plan.

AB  - This special issue addresses both the changes and the continuities that have marked the recent evolution of anthropological research on the circum-Mediterranean peoples. The authors demonstrate how a growing self-consciousness of the region's people as 'Mediterranean' produces new configurations, including official (government) but also nostalgic (local) deployments of an allegedly traditional set of supposedly Mediterranean values, including those glossed from the early days of Mediterraneanist anthropology as 'honor' and 'shame.' The region illustrates cultural and linguistic lability, helping to move anthropology toward a more flexible understanding of regional as well as national forms of belonging and of their frequent if partial convergence. In this larger cultural theatre, moreover, we can discern more clearly the artificiality of national borders, a condition that warns against returning to the concentric reification of a 'Mediterranean culture area' that was so prominent in an earlier era of scholarship and allows us to understand how and why the impulse to reify the Mediterranean as a self-evident category took such a powerful hold in both the anthropology of the 1960s and does so, in instructively different ways, in the geo-politics of today.

AB  - Balo's concentric sclerosis (BCS) is considered a variant of inflammatory demyelinating disease closely related to multiple sclerosis characterized by a discrete concentrically layered lesion in the cerebal white matter. Khonsari and Calvez (Plos ONE. 2(2007)) proposed a parabolic-elliptic-ODE chemotaxis model for BCS which describes the evolution of the densities of activated macrophages, cytokine and apoptotic oligodendrocytes. Because "classically activated" M1 microglia can produce cytotoxicity, we introduce a linear production term from the activated microglia in the ODE for pro-inflammatory cytotoxic. For the new BCS chemotaxis model, we first investigate the uniform boundedness and global existence of classical solutions, and then get a range of the chemosensitive rate x where the unique positive equilibrium point is exponentially asymptotically stable.

AB  - We present a modified TacTip biomimetic optical tactile sensor design which demonstrates the ability to induce and detect incipient slip, as confirmed by recording the movement of markers on the sensor's external surface. Incipient slip is defined as slippage of part, but not all, of the contact surface between the sensor and object. The addition of ridges - which mimic the friction ridges in the human fingertip - in a concentric ring pattern allowed for localised shear deformation to occur on the sensor surface for a significant duration prior to the onset of gross slip. By detecting incipient slip we were able to predict when several differently shaped objects were at risk of falling and prevent them from doing so. Detecting incipient slip is useful because a corrective action can be taken before slippage occurs across the entire contact area thus minimising the risk of objects been dropped.

AB  - Electoral geographical research into urban territories shows a distinction in voting behaviour between a city centre and its surroundings. A recent exploratory study of the electoral geography of Prague found that distance from the city centre was the variable that best explained the spatial variation of votes, which might follow a concentric pattern and, thus, it recommended seeking a theoretical explanation in urban sociology, e.g. in the Burgess model of the city. Following this recommendation, I compared spatial patterns of voting behaviour in two cities - Warsaw and Prague. Using component analysis, I reduced the number of analysed variables to one for each city representing the main spatial polarisation. In Prague, voting behaviour showed a distinction between the city centre, inner suburbs and outer suburbs. While the city centre and the outer suburbs were conservative, the inner suburbs tended to vote for the left. This partially follows the Burgess model. On the other hand, the electoral geography of Warsaw showed a different structure. In this article I present a way of visualising urban electoral data in maps that avoid distortion caused by varying polygon size.

AB  - In a wireless network, multiple channels can increase network capacity. However, it causes other problems, e.g., multi-channel hidden terminal problem and the issue about how to allocate channels to wireless nodes. Basically, a well-defined channel assignment can avoid radio interference and improve transmission performance. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a multiple channel assignment scheme, called concentric-hexagon-oriented multi-channel assignment (CHOMA for short), in which all deployed eNBs are organized as concentric-hexagon (C-hexa for short). Available channels are grouped and then allocated to the C-hexas. We also arrange channels allocated to a C-hexa so as to reduce radio interference among its eNBs, consequentially improving the transmission capability and performance of a wireless network. Experimental results show that the CHOMA is really an interference-free scheme, no matter whether the target system is a network with SISO, SIMO, MISO or MIMO stations.

AB  - This paper deals with the casing surface and blade tip clearance in an axial flow compressor in aeroengines. The clearance in between the tips of the blade and the casing surface should be optimized by considering the thermal and internal expansion as well as changes in concentricity due to shock loading events, to prevent catastrophic tip to casing contact. These parameters play a significant role in the efficiency enhancement of aero-engine. Generally, In case of shock loading, the tip of the blade severely damages the casing surface, which is a primary concern of an aero-engineer. To protect the tip as well as the casing, there is a coating developed called abradable coating, which is not only to allow for closer clearances. But to automatically adjust clearances, in-situ, to accept physical events and thermal variation that may be found during its exploitation. An abradable coating must have sufficient strength and hardness to resist the rigidness of aero-engine handling during assembly, transportation, and exploitation. At the same time, it must be soft enough to allow the axial flow compressor rotor blades to cut through it easily without getting pilled off in lumps. The current investigation is done to optimize the plasma coating parameters such as Powder feed rate, Plasma power, powder grain size, Gun Velocity, spray distance, Argon/hydrogen ratio, and their pressure, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This report provides an update of the epidemiology of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union during the period November 2018 to October 2019. In this period, ASF has been confirmed in Slovakia, whereas Czechia became officially ASF-free in March 2019, bringing the number of affected countries in the EU to nine. The report provides a narrative update of the situation in the different countries and an analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of the disease. There has been no increase in the proportion of seropositive hunted wild boar in the affected areas. In hunted animals, the proportions of wild boar testing polymerase chain reaction-positive and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-positive has remained low (< 0.05). In addition to the obvious seasonal peak in summer in domestic pigs, seasonality of ASF in wild boar was statistically confirmed. A network analysis demonstrated that the median velocity of the natural propagation of the disease in wild boar populations was between 2.9 and 11.7 km/year. Human-mediated spread, both in pigs and wild boar, however, remains important. Several wild boar- and domestic pig-related risk factors for ASF occurrence in non-commercial farms in Romania were identified with a case-control study. This report also updates an extensive literature review on control measures to stop the spread of the disease in wild boar and on measures to separate wild boar populations. Several new studies have been identified in this reporting period, but these did not alter the conclusions of the previous reporting period. Field experience with the use of fences as part of the control strategy deployed in the Belgian focal outbreak of ASF in wild boar is described. So far, the measures have proven effective to keep ASF virus inside the affected area. This strategy included a combination of different measures, namely zoning, carcass removal, a complete feeding ban, specific hunting regulations and depopulation actions depending on the zone, a partial ban of people and logging, and setting up a network of concentric fences.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife attacks on people in and around protected areas, where the same resources are shared by both people and wildlife, are one of the major conservation challenges in getting effective public support. This empirical study contributed to new understanding of wildlife attacks on people in the landscape of Chitwan National Park (CNP) and its neighborhood based on quantitative survey data from 2003-2013. The results show that the majority of wildlife attacks occurred in forests and cultivated land where people mostly unaware of the behavior of animals were attacked. Mostly the concentration of the attacks occurred in less than one victim per km(2). A relatively important correlation between land use and animal attacks is visible in the cases of the sloth bear and the leopard. The typical land use structure of sloth bear attacks with more than one victim per 2 km(2) is given by the dominant percentage of cultivated land, forest, and sandy areas. The remarkably high bear density is due to a relatively high percentage of water bodies, grass land and bush land preferred by the bear. Potential attacks can be reduced through effective management of park and buffer zones, and concerned authorities should also provide education about species-specific behavior of animal attacks.
   Abstract The study was conducted within and adjacent to Chitwan National Park in Nepal (CNP), where several wildlife species are involved in conflicts with humans. We assessed the spatial relationships between the number of victims/km(2) (=victim density or VD) of attack by wildlife (elephant, rhino, wild boar, sloth bear, leopard or tiger) versus landscape features, including both natural habitat type and land use by humans (e.g., nursery, orchard or cultivated). We identified four levels of VD, ranging from <1 V (victim)/4 km(2) to >1 V/2 km(2) for each land use zone, then tested for correlations at one or more of those VD between each pair of wildlife species across different land use types. Our results high correlation for sloth bear and leopard (r approximate to 0.8), for all species except elephant and wild boar at VD > 1 V/4 km(2) (r > 0.9) and for leopard vs. rhinoceros (r = 0.99) across land use types at 1 V/4 km(2)) indicate some risk-reduction measures. One of them would be division of each buffer zone into three concentric rings, for instance ranging from high-risk adjacent areas to areas of high use by humans, to low-risk where human use is low. This revision would facilitate giving local people more voice in implementing conservation measures and reducing risks.

AB  - The Gawler Ranges is a massive comprising bornhardts developed on Mesoproterozoic dacite, rhyodacite and granite. The country rocks are subdivided by orthogonal fractures into massive compartments within which are developed sets of concentric arcuate partings or sheet fractures. Similar arcuate structures were superimposed on the western sector of the upland by a meteorite impact during the earliest Palaeozoic. Following the Permian glaciation, the area was reduced to low relief. Fracture controlled differential weathering beneath the planation surface resulted in an irregular weathering front with prominent domical rises and intervening linear depressions. Uplift near the southern limit of the Mesoproterozoic outcrops caused north flowing rivers to strip the regolith and deposit the detritus in the ocean that then occupied the Eromanga Basin. There it was intercalated with marine strata that demonstrated a Neocomian-Aptian age for the alluvial deposit, and hence also for the etch or two stage bornhardt assemblage that was revealed by the evacuation of the weathered mantle. It has persisted virtually unchanged because of resistance of the country rocks. The veracity of the great age attributed to the Gawler Ranges topography is discussed, as are the possible reasons for its survival, the origin of the sheet fractures, and the reasons for the widespread development of etch or two stage features, though it is suggested that in view of the influence of shearing and resultant fractures on landscape development, it is more accurate to regard the upland as of multistage origin. and hence also for the etch or two stage bornhardt assemblage that was revealed by the evacuation of the weathered mantle. It has persisted virtually unchanged because of resistance of the country rocks. The veracity of the great age attributed to the Gawler Ranges topography is discussed, as are the possible reasons for its survival, the origin of the sheet fractures, and the reasons for the widespread development of etch or two stage features, though it is suggested that in view of the influence of shearing and resultant fractures on landscape development, it is more accurate to regard the upland as of multistage origin. and hence also for the etch or two stage born hardt assemblage that was revealed by the evacuation of the weathered mantle.

   The Gawler Ranges constitute a massif comprising inselbergs developed in dacites, rhyodacites and granites. The substrate is cut by orthogonal fractures into massive compartments integrating sets of concentric arc fractures or exfoliation joints. In the western highlands, such arched structures were intersected in the Lower Paleozoic by meteorite impact. After the Permian glaciation, the area was reduced to very little relief. Below the flattening surface, differential weathering guided by fracturing has given rise to an irregular weathering front in which domed shapes and linear depressions alternate. Uplift near the southern limit of the Mesoproterozoic outcrops caused the clearance of regolith by north-flowing rivers, as well as the deposition of the corresponding sediments in the ocean that then occupied the Eromanga Basin. The intercalation of these terrigenous inputs with marine strata proves that the alluvial deposit, and therefore the assemblage of corrosion plains and inselbergs revealed by the stripping of the weathering mantle, arc of Neocomian-Aptian age. This assembly has remained practically as it is due to the resistance of the constituent materials of the substrate. The validity of the supposed age of the topographic device of the Gawler Ranges is discussed, as well as the possible reasons for its persistence, the origin of the forms of exfoliation, and the reasons for the widespread development of flattens and two-stage formed inselbergs. Taking into account the influence of shear and associated fractures on the development of this topographic device, it appears more correct to consider these highlands as polygenic.

AB  - Introduction: Football players suffer between 2.48 and 9.4 injuries every 1000 hours of play, with injuries of the hamstring muscles being the most common. Recurrence rates for hamstring injuries remain high, despite preventive measures. These injuries are caused by running at high speed. One of the strategies for preventing injuries in football includes the FIFA protocol called FIFA 11+, a warm-up program with an average duration of 10 to 15 min.; the program based on the Nordic Flexion (NH) exercise, to generate improvement in concentric and eccentric actions, providing a protective effect against mechanisms of injury to the hamstring muscle; and programs that include Core training, which generate greater proximal muscle control during a sprint and consequently reduce the risk of injury to the hamstrings. Objective: This study aims to analyze the training programs for the prevention of main football injuries through. Methods: It is about a literature review of studies published in the last twelve years in the Pubmed, Lilacs, Scielo database. Conclusion: That Core Training should compose a training program to prevent hamstring injuries, concomitant with effective exercises such as Nordic flexion and those of the FIFA11 + protocol.

LA  - English
CP  - ASME Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference (PVP)
AB  - Pressure drop in a radial flow reactor occurs when process flow crosses the packed catalyst bed installed between the two concentric perforated screens during operation. This pressure drop generates the lateral bed stress against the reactor's perforated screens to shift. The pressure drop will further grow as catalyst attrition increases in production. For an outward radial flow, the pressure drop may exert higher stresses to the outer screen as the packed bed is pushed toward it. An extreme case is when the entire catalyst bed could be pinned to the outer screen of the reactor by enough pressure drop. This could cause the internal components to be overly stressed on the excessive bed load, for which the components might not have been designed adequately. Predicting how radial pressure drop impacts the bed stress and shifts the load distribution is important in preventing mechanical failure during operation. In this study, an analytical model is derived based on Janssen's theory, a classical semi-empirical granular solid material model, to examine a generic packed catalyst bed in an outward radical flow reactor. A modification to Janssen's theory is introduced to include pressure drop in order to explore its effects on bed stress and load. The critical condition is derived.

The species is known only from Los Tuxtlas (Veracruz, Mexico), and is distinguished by the shape and pattern of the hindwing eyespot. Unlike the eyespot of other species in Ophthalmoblysis, that of O. ibarrai has a smaller and not fully circular inner black disc. In addition, O. ibarrai can be distinguished from a similar, undescribed species from Costa Rica by the presence of a sclerotized extension at the tip of the male valva and by the shape of the cornutus in the vesica. Ophthalmoblysis ibarrai represents the northernmost member of the genus.

AB  - The present article proposes a sociological approach to language planning, drawing a perspective based on an interpretation of the advances made by the sociolinguistics in the matter from the social systems theory. The theoretical framework comprehends language planning as a strategy to regulate language contact that operates in the interaction systems -that is, in the speakers' communicative practices-. This approach is applied, as example, to different aspects of the planning of Mapudungun, Sami, and Maori. It is concluded that the planning is executed through the introduction of distinctions (to speak/not to speak, to teach/not to teach, etc.) in the environment of the interaction systems. The relevance of the consideration of the sociohistorical conditions of language contact and regulation in the analysis of these processes it is highlighted. In addition, a warning is made about the analysis of Latin-American cases, which must consider that these societies are characterized by a concentric functional differentiation, that make them differ from the societies of the central modernity.

KW  - RELIGION
AB  - It first occurred to me some thirty years ago that Shenzhou (SIC), translated "continent of the gods," was a perfect way of talking about "China in the Daoist mirror." It made it possible to think of China as a series of concentric spaces, going from the self to the cosmos, all structured in the same away around nodal points occupied by gods. Because it revealed a dense organization at every level, this space-based approach led me as well to call into question the classic distinction between "diffused" and "organized" religion. Subsequent work, both historical and in the field, gradually enabled me to see this as a long evolutionary history which begins with elite attacks on spirit-medium religion in the Warring States and culminates with the emergence of popular religion in the Song. This religion includes popular versions of the Three Teachings, but it is built around the local, anthropomorphic gods whose primary task was the protection of bounded territory and whose natural servants were the ever-maligned spirit-mediums.

AB  - Football players frequently face the occurrence of non-contact injuries. Although there are likely multiple factors that contribute to increased risk of non-contact injury, it remains a challenge to correlate all these factors. However, it is not clear how much of individual training abilities may interfere in these events. As such, the primary aim of the present study was to determine whether the reduction of functional performance of the thigh in the isokinetic knee tests, anthropometric and morbid history can establish risk factors for lower-limb musculoskeletal injuries throughout the season. The incidence of injuries and odds ratios were calculated for suspected risk factors. Hamstring/Quadriceps conventional ratio outside of the safety range (55-64%) may be involved in the occurrence of non-contact muscle injuries and the risk for any musculoskeletal injuries in the lower extremities is 16 times higher when extensor peak of torque exceeds 10% and 12 times higher when flexor peak of torque difference was greater than 10%. This kind of evaluation can result in intervention programs that may decrease the risk of lower-limb musculoskeletal injuries. Based on these results we can establish a specific and individualized exercise program for each athlete and thus protect them during the season.

AB  - It has been recently demonstrated that magnesium doped zinc oxide (MZO) can be used to replace the traditional CdS window layer in thin-film solar cells. This is due to its low light absorption and non-toxic nature. In this work, a novel method to deposit high-quality MZO thin films by reactive RF-Sputtering is proposed, avoiding high deposition temperatures and post-deposition thermal treatments. The method consists in covering the Zn target with square Mg shavings distributed in concentric circles. The covering Mg/Zn area ratio was varied to control the final composition of the as-deposited MZO film. The optical, structural, chemical, morphological, and electrical properties were studied according to the covering area ratio. The band gap value of the MZO samples was tuned from 3.30 to 3.71 eV and the electrical resistivity was reduced by two orders of magnitude (from 10(5) to 10(3) Omega cm) compared to pure ZnO film. These results are remarkable as the deposition temperature is relatively low (400 degrees C) and there was no post-deposition thermal treatment. This method produced high-quality transparent, compact, uniform, and pinhole-free MZO films, which can be used as window layer in thin-film solar cells.

AB  - Polyphenism is a type of phenotypic plasticity supposedly adaptive to drastic and recurrent changes in the environment such as seasonal alternation in temperate and tropical regions. The butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows polyphenism with well-described wet and dry seasonal forms in sub-Saharan Africa, displaying striking morphological, physiological and behavioural differences in response to higher or lower developmental temperatures. During the seasonal transition in the wild, the intermediate phenotype co-occurs with wet and dry phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to characterize the secondary sexually-selected wing traits of the intermediate form to infer its potential fitness compared to wet and dry phenotypes. Among the previously described wing morphological traits, we first showed that the area of the fifth eyespot on the ventral hindwing is the most discriminant trait to identify wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes in both sexes. Second, we characterized the intermediate form for two secondary sexually-selected wing traits: the area and UV reflectance of the dorsal forewing pupil and the composition of the male sex pheromone. We showed that values of these two traits are often between those of the wet and dry phenotypes. Third, we observed increasing male sex pheromone production in ageing dry and wet phenotypes. Our results contrast with previous reports of values for sexually-selected traits in wet and dry seasonal forms, which might be explained by differences in rearing conditions or sample size effects among studies. Wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes display redundant sexually dimorphic traits, including sexually-selected traits that can inform about their developmental temperature in sexual interactions.

AB  - Continuum robots are highly miniaturizable, exhibit non-linear shapes with several curves, and are flexible and compliant. In particular, concentric-tube and tendon-driven continuum robots can be designed on a small scale with diameters of below 10 mm. A small diameter-to-length ratio enables insertion of these robots through small entry points in order to reach hardly accessible regions by avoiding obstacles. This scenario can often be found in minimally invasive surgery and technical inspections. However, to reach the target region, a deployment along a narrow tortuous path is often required. Common tendon-driven continuum robots are intrinsically incapable of such deployment and concentric-tube continuum robots require special path conditions and intensive parameter optimization. Other proposed robot types, such as hyper-redundant and pneumatically actuated robots, exhibit less favorable diameter-to-length ratios and are thus not suitable for those tasks. Since the limiting factors are found in the design of continuum robots, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot design, which features an additional degree of freedom in each robot section. The backbone is composed of straight, concentrically arranged tubes, each of which composes a section and is used to adapt its length. We present a three-section continuum robot prototype with a diameter of 7 mm, determine its follow-the-leader capabilities theoretically, and validate the results experimentally using model-based control. For our 165 mm long robot prototype, the repeatability is below 2.38 mm. The model accuracy reaches a median of 3.16% over 25 configurations with respect to robot length. The path-following error over five curvilinear paths results in median errors of 2.59% with respect to robot length.

AB  - Ring-shaped SiC ceramics used in sliding components were examined herein. Conventional lapping generates many shallow scratches in random directions in the surface of such SiC ceramics, and these starches extend from the inner circumference of the surface to its perimeter. The scratches affect the ability of the surface to prevent liquid from escaping from the perimeter side to the inner-circumference side of the SiC ring, and they can increase the friction force of the finished surface as a sliding material. We propose concentric mutual lapping to remove the scratches caused by conventional lapping. The surface topography of a SiC ring is evaluated quantitatively using a white light interferometer, and a vector and quantitative analysis of the surface profile is proposed. The results show that concentric mutual lapping can quickly remove the scratches caused by conventional lapping, and subsequently, circumferential scratches are generated along the lapping direction. We have also conducted sliding tests to analyze the effect of surface topography on the surface function as a sliding material. The results reveal that concentric mutual lapping suppresses the differences in surface function that occurred depending on the sliding direction.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the competitive season on isokinetic muscular parameters of the lower limbs in world-class handball players. Nineteen, male, world-class, handball players (age, 26.6 +/- 5.4 years) participated in the study. Two bilateral isokinetic tests of knee joint flexors (H; hamstring) and extensors (Q; quadriceps) were performed in the beginning and end of the competitive season to determine the peak torque (PT), the mean power, and agonist-antagonist ratio, dominant-nondominant ratio (DNDR), and combined ratio. The results showed a significant decrease in PT values at low angular velocity (60 degrees.s(-1)) in concentric mode for Q on dominant leg (p < 0.001). The other PT values for dominant and nondominant legs at low and high angular velocities (240 degrees.s(-1)) and in eccentric mode (30 degrees.s(-1)) were not significantly different for Q and H. For mean power, values did not change at 60 degrees.s(-1). At 240 degrees.s(-1), we found a significant decrease in H for dominant leg (p < 0.001) but not for nondominant leg. In eccentric mode, the results showed a significant increase on both legs (p < 0.001). For the ratios, values significantly decreased for DNDR at 60 degrees.s(-1) for Q (p < 0.03) and for agonist/antagonist ratio at 240 degrees.s(-1) for the dominant leg (p < 0.01). The present results highlight the importance of integrating regular strength training sessions during the competitive season in world-class handball players. Accordingly, this study should help trainers to modify their planning to maximize strength and power qualities of the lower limbs of their players in addition to avoiding injuries.

AB  - Manufacturing errors are always unavoidable in actual machines. In external gear machines (EGMs), some of the manufacturing errors are typically on the same scale as the nominal clearances between the internal parts. These clearances are responsible for leakage flows that reduce the volumetric efficiency of EGMs and impact their overall performance. Current approaches of modeling the operation of EGMs neglect the manufacturing errors which limits their accuracy.
   This paper proposes a technique to study the operation of EGMs accounting for two common gear manufacturing errors: conicity and concentricity. Furthermore, an alternate technique to model these errors is proposed by defining an "effective gap height". This latter technique can be used in any existing lumped parameter model as well as for quick estimations. To validate the approach, experiments are performed with gearsets exhibiting varying amounts of conicity and concentricity errors.
   The results from both the simulations and the experiments show that the volumetric efficiency decreases with an increase of the conicity error. Instead, by increasing the concentricity error, an increase in the volumetric efficiency is found, at least until the conditions of contact between the gears and the casing's internal surface are avoided.

AB  - Resistance training is often recommended for combined increases in traditional and alternative hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) ratios in order to reduce knee strength imbalance and associated hamstrings and knee ligament injury risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different concentric and eccentric resistance training programs on traditional and alternative H:Q ratios. Forty male volunteers were assigned to one of 4 groups: concentric quadriceps and concentric hamstrings (CON/CON, n = 10), eccentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstrings (ECC/ECC, n = 10), concentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstrings (CON/ECC, n = 10), or no training (control (CNTRL), n = 10). Traditional conventional (CR) and functional (FR), alternative rate of torque development (RTD), muscle size (MS), and muscle activation (MA) H:Q ratios were measured before and after six weeks of unilateral nondominant knee extension-flexion resistance training performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. The ECC/ECC training significantly increased FR (pre = 0.75 +/- 0.11; post = 0.85 +/- 0.15), whereas the lack of training (CNTRL) decreased the RTD H:Q ratio (pre = 1.10 +/- 0.67; post = 0.73 +/- 0.33). There were no differences between groups for the other traditional and alternative ratios following resistance training protocols. These findings suggest eccentric exercise for quadriceps and hamstrings as the most beneficial training program for inducing increases in the traditional FR. However, different resistance training strategies may be needed to also elicit increases in the alternative RTD, MS, and MA H:Q ratios for fully restoring muscle balance and reducing potential hamstrings and knee ligament injury risk.

AB  - We consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic annular flows around a circular island with a radial offshore bottom slope. Since the conical bottom topography causes a certain beta effect, by analogy with the conventional beta plane we term our model a beta cone. Our focus is on the flows with zero total circulation, which are composed of two concentric rings of uniform potential vorticity (PV) attached to the island. The linear stability of such flows on a beta cone was investigated in a previous publication of ours. In the present paper, we study numerically the nonlinear evolution of weakly viscous flows, whose parameters are fitted so as to guarantee the highest instability of the azimuthal mode m = 1, ... 6. We study the production of vortices and Rossby waves due to the instability, consider the effect of waves on the emerging vortices and the interaction between the vortices. As in the flat-bottom case, at m >= 2, the instability at weak bottom slopes normally leads to the emission of m dipoles. However, a fundamental difference between the flat-bottom and beta-cone cases is observed in the trajectories of the dipoles as the latter recede from the island. When the flow is initially counterclockwise, the conical beta effect may force the dipoles to make a complete turn, come back to the island and rearrange in new couples that again leave the island and return. This quasi-periodic process gradually fades due to filamentation, wave radiation and viscous dissipation. Another possible outcome is symmetrical settling of m dipoles in a circular orbit around the island, in which they move counterclockwise. This behaviour is reminiscent of the adaptation of strongly tilted beta-plane modons (dipoles) to the eastward movement. If the initial flow is clockwise, the emerged dipoles usually disintegrate, but sometimes, the orbital arrangement is possible. At a moderate slope, the evolution of an unstable flow, which is initially clockwise, may end up in the formation of a counterclockwise flow. At steeper slopes, a clockwise flow may transform into a quasi-stationary vortex multipole. When the slope is sufficiently steep, the topographic Rossby waves developing outside of the PV rings can smooth away the instability crests and troughs at the outer edge of the main flow, thus preventing the vortex production but allowing the formation of a new quasi-stationary pattern, a doubly connected coherent PV structure possessing m -fold symmetry. Such an m-fold pattern can be steady only if it rotates counterclockwise, otherwise it radiates Rossby waves and transforms eventually into a circularly symmetric flow.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of fatiguing exercise on sex-related differences in the function of hamstring and quadriceps muscles at several angular velocities and joint angles. Physically active participants (50 male: 28.7 +/- 4.5y, 1.82 +/- 0.07 m, 82.3 +/- 6.87kg; 50 female: 27.0 +/- 5.8y, 1.61 +/- 0.08 m, 68.75 +/- 9.24kg) carried out an isokinetic assessment to determine concentric and eccentric torques during knee extension and flexion actions at three different angular velocities (60/180/300 degrees/s). The H/Q(FUNCT) was calculated using peak torque (PT) values at 3 different joint-angle-specific (15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees of knee flexion). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare within group results. Between group comparisons of sex-related differences were assessed by independent T-tests. Fatiguing exercise in males resulted in a decrease in H/Q(FUNCT) ratios for each angle of knee flexion at both 60 degrees/s and 300 degrees/s angular velocities (p<0.05). In females, significant decreases in H/Q(FUNCT) ratios were observed following fatiguing exercise for each angle of knee flexion and angular velocity (p<0.01). Significant differences in H/Q(FUNCT) ratios following fatiguing exercise were evident between males and females at each joint angle and angular velocity (p<0.01). These findings indicate sex related differences in H/Q(FUNCT) ratios following fatiguing exercise. Females have greater reductions in torque and H/Q(FUNCT) ratios following fatigue than their male counterparts. This potentially exposes females to higher risks of injury, particularly when fatigued. Practitioners should attend to the imbalance in fatigue resistance of hamstring and quadriceps function, particularly in female athletes.

AB  - The apical annuli are among the most intriguing and understudied structures in the cytoskeleton of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We mapped the proteome of the annuli in Toxoplasma by reciprocal proximity biotinylation (BioID), and validated five apical annuli proteins (AAP1-5), Centrin2, and an apical annuli methyltransferase. Moreover, inner membrane complex (IMC) suture proteins connecting the alveolar vesicles were also detected and support annuli residence within the sutures. Super-resolution microscopy identified a concentric organisation comprising four rings with diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm. The high prevalence of domain signatures shared with centrosomal proteins in the AAPs together with Centrin2 suggests that the annuli are related and/or derived from the centrosomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the AAPs are conserved narrowly in coccidian, apicomplexan parasites that multiply by an internal budding mechanism. This suggests a role in replication, for example, to provide pores in the mother IMC permitting exchange of building blocks and waste products. However, presence of multiple signalling domains and proteins are suggestive of additional functions. Knockout of AAP4, the most conserved compound forming the largest ring-like structure, modestly decreased parasite fitness in vitro but had no significant impact on acute virulence in vivo. In conclusion, the apical annuli are composed of coiled-coil and signalling proteins assembled in a pore-like structure crossing the IMC barrier maintained during internal budding.

AB  - There are many interference fringe patterns with nonuniformly illuminating background noise. Nonuniformly illuminating background noise may arise from diverse sources, such as scratches, small interfering concentric circles, gaussian noise, etc. with a nonuniform light source. In this work, we propose a practical fringe pattern denoising method using a simple neural network. However, nonuniform illumination prevents us from comparing the denoised images with the ground truths. The verification of the proposed method is shown indirectly using the uniformized results obtained from a nonuniform illumination correcting process.

AB  - he aim of this study was to check for upper limb volume asymmetry and strength ratio of shoulder muscle rotators in young tennis players. A total of 21 young male tennis players took part in the study. Subjects' maturity status was determined using predicted age at peak height velocity (PHV); thus, the sample was divided into two groups: negative maturity offset values (PREPHV; n= 9) and positive values, including 0 (POSTPHV; n= 12). Upper limb volumes were estimated using the truncated cone method. Concentric peak torque in the external and internal shoulder rotations was determined using an isokinetic dynamometer at 60(o).s(-1). The external to internal rotation ratio was also calculated. There was morphological upper limb asymmetry in both groups (p< 0.05), with no difference between the groups. However, only the POSTPHV group presented shoulder strength asymmetry. External to internal rotation ratios were 76% and 89% for dominant and nondominant arms, respectively, in the POSTPHV group. PHV seems to be a critical period for functional asymmetry in young tennis players, particularly the internal rotation strength and conventional ratio of shoulder rotation. Thus, an assessment of shoulder rotator strength is required to monitor its progression and avoid the risk of injury in the dominant rotator cuff.

AB  - All-steel buckling restrained brace (BRB) is a type of relatively new common bracings considering its low weight and whilst it is not required curing of mortar at the core of braces. In this study, a new form of all-steel BRB is introduced with corrugated edges of the core and the external sheath, and it was analyzed by using of finite element method. Existence of corrugated and ribbed edges led to enhance of buckling resistance. Numerical model was validated with laboratory samples, and after receiving an acceptable compliance in model behavior, the numerical models were offered. In this analysis, key parameters were size of brace section and distance of gap between the internal and external sheaths. The most appropriate size for gap between the core and external tube was determined to be 10mm. Upon specifying the non-linear modeling parameter, two cases of frame with ordinary concentrically brace and the proposed all-steel BRB were compared for three structures with 4, 8 and 12 floors using pushover and non-linear time history analysis. The results demonstrated that utilizing of the proposed BRB will lead to an increase in behavior coefficient and structure ductility as well as an alteration in performance level of tall structures from collapse prevention to life safety level.

AB  - Two standard 7YSZ coatings were deposited by EB-PVD techniques and tested against CMAS infiltration at short time intervals (up to 8 min.) at 1250 degrees C in air. They exhibited different microstructures, i.e. porosities and microstructural features. Two species of CMAS with different compositions were used and their viscosities were determined using the concentric cylinder method and their contact angles were measured using high temperature heating microscopy. The theoretical viscosities, which were calculated using a statistical model based on the chemical composition of the melts, differed from the measured values of the viscosities by one order of magnitude. A large variation in the contact angles within a very short range of temperature (1243-1266 degrees C) was observed as well. The porosity and surface area measurements were performed on both EB-PVD microstructures using the nitrogen physisorption method. Additionally, the produced coatings exhibited porosities of 14.5 and 29.5 percent and the infiltration experiments have shown that the more porous coating provides higher infiltration resistance. The effect of porosity on CMAS infiltration kinetics was investigated and the results elucidate that the porosity network plays a more preeminent role than the amount of porosity. The experimental infiltration results have been compared with calculated infiltration data using a novel mathematical approach proposed in previous studies in which the permeability of the coatings is assessed with two contrasting methods termed "concentric pipe" and "open pipe" models. The infiltration was calculated by incorporating the experimentally determined properties such as contact angle, viscosity and porosity. A fitting parameter has been derived from the equations for the geometry factor for both microstructures. The calculated and experimental results are in good agreement with the concentric pipe model supporting the validity of this CMAS infiltration model.

AB  - In order to reduce the usage amount of pesticide fertilizers and protect the natural environment, seed coating agents are receiving increased wide concern. In this study, the active constituent (pesticide) and inactive components (surfactants and film former) of the seed coating agents were screened and optimized by the wet sand processing superfine grinding method. The fungal inhibition test of pesticides showed that thifluzamide, fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin, and difenoconazole have an obvious fungal inhibitory effect on wheat sharp eyespot, take-all, and root rot. LAE-9 and polyacrylamide + carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is recommended for the safe surfactant and film former, respectively, based on the seed germination test. Moreover, 6% difenoconazole center dot fludioxonil flowable concentrate for seed coating (FSC) stimulates the seedling growth of wheat, advances the growth of root, and improves biomass in the field trial, meanwhile, the control efficiency reached above 80%. Thus, we suggested it can be used as an effective seed coating agent for the control of soil-borne diseases in wheat. The seed coating agent has the characteristics of disease prevention, increasing crop yield, and safety of environment, which is of significance in practical application.

AB  - Background: Avoiding superior inclination of the glenoid component in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is crucial. We hypothesized that superior inclination was underestimated in RSA. Our purpose was to describe and assess a new measurement of inclination for the inferior portion of the glenoid (where the baseplate rests).
   Methods: The study included 47 shoulders with rotator cuff tear arthropathy (mean age, 76 years). The reverse shoulder arthroplasty angle (RSA angle), defined as the angle between the inferior part of the glenoid fossa and the perpendicular to the floor of the supraspinatus, was compared with the global glenoid inclination (beta angle or total shoulder arthroplasty [TSA] angle). Measurements were made on plain anteroposterior radiographs and reformatted 2-dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT) scans by 3 independent observers and compared with 3-dimensional (3D) software (Glenosys) measurements.
   Results: The mean RSA angle was 25 degrees +/- 8 degrees on plain radiographs, 20 degrees +/- 6 degrees on reformatted 2D CT scans, and 21 degrees +/- 5 degrees via 3D reconstruction software. The mean TSA angle was on average 10 degrees +/- 5 degrees lower than the mean RSA angle (P < .001); this difference was observed regardless of the method of measurement (radiographs, 2D CT, or 3D CT) and type of glenoid erosion according to Favard. In Favard type E1 glenoids with central concentric erosion, the difference between the 2 angles was 12 degrees +/- 4 degrees (P < .001).
   Conclusion: The same angle cannot be used to measure glenoid inclination in anatomic and reverse prostheses. The TSA (or beta) angle underestimates the superior orientation of the reverse baseplate in RSA. The RSA angle (20 degrees +/- 5 degrees) needs to be corrected to achieve neutral inclination of the baseplate (RSA angle = 0 degrees). Surgeons should be aware that E1 glenoids (with central erosion) are at risk for baseplate superior tilt if the RSA angle is not corrected. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: The association between prehypertension (pre-HTN) and abnormal left ventricular (LV) geometric patterns is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of echocardiographic studies aimed to provide a new piece of information on LV geometric alterations in untreated preHTN individuals.
   Design: Studies were identified by crossing the following search terms: 'prehypertension,' ' high normal blood pressure,' 'heart,' 'LV hypertrophy' (LVH), 'LV geometry,' 'LV mass,' and 'echocardiography.'
   Results: A total 60 949 participants (38 536 normotensive, 14 453 pre-HTN, and 7960 HTN individuals) were included in six studies. LV concentric remodelling was the most common abnormal pattern in pre-HTN participants followed by eccentric and concentric LVH. Compared with normotensive group, pre-HTN exhibited a higher risk of LV concentric remodelling (OR 1.89, CI 1.70-2.10, P< 0.001), eccentric LVH (OR 1.65, CI 1.40-1.90, P< 0.001) and concentric LVH (OR 2.09, CI 1.50-3.00, P< 0.001). The likelihood of having abnormal LV patterns in HTN was significantly higher (P< 0.001 for all) than in pre-HTN participants.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that alterations in LV geometry in pre-HTN individuals are intermediate between normotensive and HTN individuals. These findings suggest that pre-HTN is associated to early changes in LV structure and geometry, and preventive strategies may have a protective impact on development of subclinical cardiac damage in this setting.

AB  - This article focuses on the different aspects of colonial violence towards indigenous peoples in the region of Buenos Aires from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. It analyzes not only the manifest expressions of physical violence (massacres, captivities, exemplar executions and physical punishment) but also the less flagrant forms of coercion, fear and subjection that developed along a continuum of invisible forms of violence: the structural, the symbolic, and the normalized violence. This impersonal and permanent framework of unequal social relations is the context that we have to bear in mind when scrutinizing the varied indigenous strategies of survival.
   This study analyzes how the multiple faces of colonial violence were perceived by native societies and in which ways they reacted to them. It aims at demonstrating that these forms of violence affected, in concentric waves, not only those indigenous peoples forcibly taken into the colonial system but also those who are usually seen as non-subjugated inhabitants of the margins that could hold close and, at the same time, conflictive ties with colonial society.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is the detailed study of one of the excavations that has marked the evolution of Fontbouisse of MITRA III located in Garons (Gard, France) whilst focussing on the development and the disappearance of enclosures in the south of France.
   The site located near to a site known as Puech Ferrier, an unpublished enclosure of MITRA III excavated in 2011, was first excavated in 2012 within the framework of preventive archaeology. This exploration of a 5000 m(2) surface revealed the southern part and the entrance of an installation delimited by at least two ditches which succeed one another, dating to a period between the 27th and 24th centuries BC that includes the development of the culture of Fontbouisse, the Campaniforme (Bell Beaker) and the emergence of the early Bronze (BA2).
   A network of three concentric ditches, the innermost enclosure being the oldest, makes up the first enclosure, where an interruption in the ditches allows access to the site. A later much larger wider and deeper ditch cuts across the first enclosure.
   The paper focusses on the study of this ditch and its fill, which is the only enclosed site dating to the Late Neolithic in the south of France. Observed over nearly 90 m, this ditch delimits the southern part of the site. It contains fragments of mudbrick over a silty ashy layer the anthracological spectrum of which contains mainly by oak.
   Based on the results of stratigraphic and soil micromorphology, a phased filling of the ditch can be proposed. Microand macroscopic characterization of the earthen elements found in the ditch have specified the nature of the cob and wattle and daub and the demolished structure they came from.
   The findings reveal that the ditch remained open for a relatively short period of time, after which a cob structure, perhaps a wall, was installed, the base of which is preserved in a portion of the ditch. The ditch was then filled in by the destruction of another earthen and wood structure.
   This architecture could have been used to strengthen the monumental aspect of the enclosure, the hypothesis being that it copied a layout observed on other Fontbuxien settlements. A violent fire subsequently destroyed this ditch-wall enclosure and a possible adjoining building. Following on from this event, the ditch was re-dug before being filled in after the site is abandoned.
   The exact dating of the ditch and the destruction of the earthen wall remain imprecise.
   Some elements found in the lower ditch fill date to the first phase of the Fontbouisse culture. They stylistically refer productions from the plain of Herault and Gard. However, the destruction of the earthen architecture is dated by radiocarbon analysis and pottery found in the upper layers and the discovery of a sherd with international style decoration gives a later dating range of between 2450 and 2250 cal. BC.
   This enclosure and its destruction constitute a milestone in Fontbouisse and Late Neolithic chronology. Its foundation and destruction occur within a short space of time. The events that occurred during the history of MITRA date the initial foundation and development of the concentric enclosures and the site's total overhaul, which happened shortly before its abandon. The entrance identified at Mitra III, the new ditch with its earthen architecture that cut across the first enclosure around 2500 cal. BC questions our knowledge of the development and disappearance of enclosures at a pivotal period (Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age) in southern France.

AB  - Background: Being aware of ankle movement and motor control has a critical role in maintaining balance during functional activities such as standing, walking, and running. Since the somatosensory system declines with aging, this is even more important for older adults.
   Research question: How do different exercise modalities (static stretching, one-leg balance task, concentric contractions, and control) acutely influence ankle motion sense in young and older adults?
   Methods: Seventeen young and fifteen older participants performed four different intervention protocols (static stretching, one-leg balance task, concentric contractions, and control) in random order. Each session comprised measurements of ankle motion sense in plantar flexion (PF) and dorsal flexion (DF) directions prior to and after an intervention protocol. Average threshold levels (in degrees) of motion sense detection were calculated from three trials in each direction (PF/DF).
   Results: A lower threshold of motion ankle sense was observed for young adults compared to older adults regardless of the exercise modality and the direction of the movement (p < 0.001). However, the changes in PF and DF ankle motion senses followed a similar trend in both groups during the three exercise modalities: static stretching increased ankle motion sense threshold (PF: 14% and 5%; DF: 19% and 11% in young and older adults, respectively), concentric contractions decreased ankle motion sense threshold (PF: - 24% and - 14%; DF: -19% and - 21% in young and older adults, respectively), and the one-leg balance task did not significantly influence the ankle motion sense threshold (PF: -1% and -2%; DF: 6% and 1% in young and older adults, respectively).
   Significance: Based on these results, static stretching should not be performed before ankle activities that require a good balance, precision, and coordination. Concentric contractions could be recommended before activities that challenge our postural stability.

AB  - The modem distribution of the western Eurasian sub-boreal butterfly species Coenonympha leander (Esper, 1784) was studied in the Urals region, with the northeastern range limits specified at 56 degrees N and 65 degrees E. There are isolated local C. leander populations in the forested steppe, while in the steppe zone the species is distributed fairly uniformly. In the Urals steppes, the species is tolerant to moderate anthropogenic transformations of natural communities, being not too rare. Nor can it serve as an indicator species like in other parts of the range. The geographic variations of the wing length, as well as the diameters and frequency of wing pattern eyespots are analyzed. The greatest morphological peculiarities are distinguished in the marginal outpost populations, especially the northernmost population from Nizhneye Tukbaevo, Bashkortostan, which lives in the unique conditions of the azonal Mesyagutovo forested steppe and tends to form a cline from north to south: the size of the wings is decreased, while the diameter of the eyespots and the frequency of their occurrence are increased.

AB  - Investigations of trunk strength with high-level athletes are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare maximal concentric isokinetic trunk extension and flexion torque, power, and strength ratios between high-level weightlifters (n = 20), wrestlers (n = 20) and a control (n = 25) population. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to evaluate peak torque, power and strength ratios during seated trunk extension/flexion actions at 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s. There were no significant anthropometric differences between groups. Overall, trunk isokinetic force variables as a function of the increase in angular velocity, showed a decrease in peak torque, but an increase in power (athletes and controls). Compared to the control group, athletes demonstrated significantly higher trunk extension torque (+67.05 N.m, ES = 0.81) and power (+49.28 N.m, ES = 0.82) at 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s, respectively. Athletes produced significantly greater trunk flexion-extension ratios at 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s (ES = 0.80-0.47) than controls. Weightlifters and wrestlers exhibited significantly higher extensor than flexor torque at all angular velocities. Weightlifters demonstrated greater torque (ES = 0.79) than wrestlers at 60 degrees/s. The wrestlers' average power was significantly higher (ES = 0.43) than weightlifters at 180 degrees/s. There were no significant ratio differences between wrestlers (66.23%) and weightlifters (72.06%). Weightlifters had stronger extensor muscles at 60 degrees/s, whereas wrestlers had higher power at 180 degrees/s for extensor muscles. It was postulated that the extensor muscles were stronger than the flexors to ensure trunk stabilisation, and for prevention of injuries. These differences seem to be associated to the movements that occur in each sport in terms of both muscle actions and contractile forces.

AB  - Background: The FIFA 11+ has shown to increase muscle strength and reduce injury risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players. Methods: Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 +/- 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 +/- 5.1 years). The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus). Results: No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences. At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb. No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time. Conclusions: Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players. However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive and compensatory mechanism preserving cardiac output during detrimental stimuli. Nevertheless, long-term stimuli incite chronic hypertrophy and may lead to heart failure. In this review, we analyze the recent literature regarding the role of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activity in cardiac hypertrophy. ERK signaling produces beneficial effects during the early phase of chronic pressure overload in response to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and integrin stimulation. These functions comprise (i) adaptive concentric hypertrophy and (ii) cell death prevention. On the other hand, ERK participates in maladaptive hypertrophy during hypertension and chemotherapy-mediated cardiac side effects. Specific ERK-associated scaffold proteins are implicated in either cardioprotective or detrimental hypertrophic functions. Interestingly, ERK phosphorylated at threonine 188 and activated ERK5 (the big MAPK 1) are associated with pathological forms of hypertrophy. Finally, we examine the connection between ERK activation and hypertrophy in (i) transgenic mice overexpressing constitutively activated RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), (ii) animal models with mutated sarcomeric proteins characteristic of inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCMs), and (iii) mice reproducing syndromic genetic RASopathies. Overall, the scientific literature suggests that during cardiac hypertrophy, ERK could be a good player to be stimulated or a bad actor to be mitigated, depending on the pathophysiological context.

AB  - For a seismically designed concentrically braced frame with hollow structural sections as braces, the typical connection design consists of a slotted brace that is field welded to a gusset plate. During an earthquake, the brace is expected to buckle out-of-plane and the gusset plate is expected to yield. This makes it difficult to repair or replace the brace and connection, and the out-of-plane brace buckling caused by this connection can also damage surrounding walls and cladding, with potential life safety implications. This paper proposes an alternative connection that is expected to result in reduced erection costs by avoiding site welding, and also to simplify structural repairs following a major earthquake by confining all damage to a replaceable brace module. Additionally, the new connection causes the brace to buckle in-plane during a seismic event, reducing the potential for damage to the surrounding walls and cladding. This paper discusses large-scale quasi-static cyclic testing of eight brace modules with two variations of the new connection, one with a single-shear eccentric splice and the other with a double-sided concentric splice. All tested specimens had the desired failure progression and buckled in-plane, as intended. Bolt slip in the connection had very little effect on the overall force-deflection response after the brace compressive strength degraded to less than the slip load. The brace module was replaced after each test without observable damage outside the module. Although both connection variations behaved in a desirable manner, the single-shear eccentric splice was preferred because of the simpler constructability and improved performance.

AB  - Plot-based data collection is an important component of quantitative ecological research and is widely used. Some of the most extensive plot-networks can be found in country-wide forest inventories, which provide critical information about the state of forest ecosystems. While sampling designs for forest inventories have been well studied, plot design and installation has received less attention. The New Zealand National Forest Inventory of natural forest uses a nested plot design with a 0.126 ha circular plot superimposed concentrically on a 0.04 ha square plot. Stems >= 60 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) are measured in the circular plot while stems >= 2.5 DBH are measured in the square plot. Stem density of >= 60 cm DBH stems measured in the circular plots were compared with those from square plots. Stem densities estimated from square plot measurements were 23.7% higher than those estimated from circular plot measurements in the 2002-2007 inventory, and 18.4% higher in the 2009-2014 inventory. The main cause of this discrepancy appears to be due to the placement of plot boundaries during establishment of square plots. This effect may have resulted from a subconscious tendency of field teams to include large trees inside plots when laying out these boundaries. It is concluded that estimates from the circular plots are unlikely to be biased while those from the square plots are positively biased. This study highlights the critical importance of plot design and plot placement in forest inventories to ensure that estimates of stand attributes are unbiased. Especially on undulating or uneven terrain, methods of determining whether trees are inside or outside plot boundaries of circular plots are likely to be more accurate than those typically used for square or rectangular plots.

AB  - This rotary engine comprises a cylindrical chamber inside a casing wherein there is a concentric rotatable power shaft and a rotatable asymmetric main wheel mounted eccentrically enough as such to avoid contact with the wall of cylindrical chamber. In addition, two bars traversing the main wheel radially further have a wiping contact with the cylindrical chamber wherein one bar is fixed with power shaft and other bar is hinged with said power shaft. A combustion process is in detonation phase within a demarcated combustion chamber whereby the combustion chamber rotatably travels from a bottom dead volume to a top dead volume, and hence, a power, generated during this path of rotational travel, is subsequently available for delivery at the concentric power shaft.

AB  - The aim of the study was to describe the strength symmetry of internal and external rotator muscles and the conventional and functional strength balance ratios between these muscles in adolescent male volleyball players. Twenty-eight male adolescent volleyball players (15.5 +/- 1.1 years (15-17 years); 73.2 +/- 10.9 kg (55.3-100.1 kg) and 184.9 +/- 8.4 cm (170-209 cm)) participated in this cross-sectional study. Concentric and eccentric peak torque of external and internal rotator muscles were measured, and conventional and functional strength balance ratios were calculated. The dominant limb presented significantly higher values for peak torque than the non-dominant limb of internal rotator muscles at concentric action assessed at 60 degrees/s (48.7 +/- 13.7 Nm and 43.9 +/- 11.6 Nm, p = 0.01 and d value = 0.37) and at 240 degrees/s (44.7 +/- 11.2 Nm and 41.1 +/- 11.0 Nm, p = 0.03 and d = 0.32). However, there was no difference in the peak torque of external rotator muscle between limbs for either angular speed. Regarding strength balance ratios, neither conventional (74.8 +/- 14.3 for dominant limb and 80.1 +/- 14.0 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.37) nor functional ratio (1.2 +/- 0.4 for dominant limb and 1.3 +/- 0.5 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.22) presented significant contralateral differences. Despite the short practice time, adolescent male volleyball athletes already have significant contralateral differences for internal rotator muscles and conventional ratio tends to be asymmetrical. Thus, preventive shoulder-strengthening programs, focused on the internal rotator muscles of the non-dominant limb, aiming to correct contralateral deficiency and conventional ratio, may be warranted for this population in the process of biological growth, maturation and development.

AB  - The Olympic Dam Cu-U-Au-Ag deposit is dominantly composed of mineralised hematite-breccias and occurs entirely within the Roxby Downs Granite. Multivariate statistical analysis of a large whole-rock, 15 m-interval geochemical dataset (10,565 samples) was undertaken to identify geochemical signatures characteristic of iron-oxide copper gold (IOCG)-style mineralization and constrain the conspicuous lithogeochemical zonation observed at Olympic Dam. Statistical analyses include principal component analysis on centred logratio (clr)-transformed data coupled with hierarchical clustering. Certain groups of elements that can be interpreted in terms of an evolving hydrothermal system relative to host lithologies are derived from data analysis: granitophile (U-W-Sn-Mo); siderophile (Ni-Co); chalcophile (Ag-Bi) and related elements (As-Sb and Au-Te). The distributions of elements within each group are investigated through three vertical cross-sections and are compared with known lithological and Cu-(Fe)-sulphide zonation. Throughout the Olympic Dam Breccia Complex, the IOCG signature is defined by multi-element combinations of the commodity metals Cu, U, Au, and Ag, coupled with a range of trace elements. Overall, the IOCG signature overlaps well with Fe-metasomatism despite mismatch which is likely due to discrete styles of mineralisation found only on the margins of the deposit and also to the presence of mineralised domains within Fe-poor zones. The IOCG signature is composed of two geochemical associations, which exhibit distinct spatial distributions. The first group, Cu-U3O8-Se-S, shows concentric zonation whereas the second group, Au-W-Mo-Sb-As, forms a vertical similar to 1800 m deep corridor in the southeastern lobe of the deposit. The specific Au-W-Mo-As-Sb signature could potentially be generic within IOCG systems across the Olympic Cu-Au province and if so, would provide a proxy model for near-mine exploration.

AB  - Proper ankle motor control is critical for balance in the human body during functional activities such as standing, walking, and running. Different exercise modalities are often performed during the same training session where earlier activities may influence later ones. The purpose of the current study was to determine the acute effects of different exercise modalities on ankle force sense. Seventeen subjects performed four different intervention protocols (static stretching, balance task, concentric contractions, and control) in random order. Each session comprised measurements before and after the intervention protocol of the force sense of the ankle plantar flexors (PF) and dorsal flexors (DF) at 10% and 30% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC). Absolute errors (AE) were calculated separately for each force level and muscle group. An overall PF error (PF-SUM = PF at 10% MVC + PF at 30% MVC), DF error (DF-SUM = DF at 10% MVC + DF at 30% MVC) and ankle error (PF-DF-SUM = PF-SUM + DF-SUM) were also calculated. The main effect of time generally revealed that ankle force sense was significantly reduced after static stretching (PF-DF-SUM: Pre: 6.11 +/- 2.17 Nm, Post: 8.03 +/- 3.28 Nm; p < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed for the concentric contractions (PF-DF-SUM: Pre: 6.01 +/- 1.97 Nm, Post: 6.50 +/- 2.28 Nm) and the balance task (PF-DF-SUM: Pre: 5.25 +/- 1.97 Nm, Post: 5.50 +/- 1.26 Nm). The only significant interaction was observed for the PF-DF-SUM (F = 4.48, p = 0.008) due to greater error scores after stretching (+31.4%) compared to the concentric (+8.2%), balance (+4.8%), and control (-3.5%) conditions. Based on these results, static stretching should not be performed before activities that require a high ankle force sense such as balance, coordination, and precision tasks.

AB  - A quasi-dimensional thermodynamic model was developed using concept of the fractal-geometry combustion model by focusing on the behavior of the natural gas flame near the combustion chamber walls in SI engines. A new wall-flame interaction sub-model was designed and implemented in the thermodynamic model by considering the flame geometry and temperature of the combustion chamber walls. Near the walls, the dimensionless factor affects the fractal combustion model which reduces the heat release rate (HRR). First, the combustion process of natural gas fueled SI engine was simulated using a CFD software and the flame geometry was extracted for each crank angle. The results were validated with experimental data at various engine operating conditions so that the results were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The results show that the concentric spherical flame propagation assumption is not true for the off-center spark plug. The walls near the flame prevent its propagation and its shape deviates from the spherical form. The points of flame collisions on the walls are one of the determinant factors in the heat release process. The flame quenching and HRR vary at different walls of the combustion chamber and both of them are proportional to the wall temperature and flame area affected by the walls. Finally, it can be concluded that, natural gas turbulent flame propagation is occurred in three stages: 1- The initial propagation of flame with high acceleration, in which 15% of the fuel is burned with a high HRR. 2- Collision of the flame with the floor of the piston, HRR continues with almost constant rate, in which 30% and 50% of the fuel is burned for the off-centered and centered spark plug locations, respectively. 3- Deceleration of the flame propagation after colliding with the side walls, in which 55% and 35% of the fuel is burned for the off- centered and centered spark plug locations, respectively.

AB  - The built-up special concentrically braced frames (BSCBFs) containing double-angle and double-channel braces are among the common steel structural systems resisting lateral loads. In this paper, the parameters influencing the BSCBF seismic behaviours are investigated under cyclic loading. For this purpose, nonlinear finite element analyses of a single-bay single-story frame are employed, and the results show that increasing the number of stitches or decreasing their distances along the length of the built-up members may not necessarily improve the behaviour of the braced systems. That is, inelastic deformation concentration probably occurs in individual elements between stitches, resulting in earlier failure of braces. Moreover, the failure results of the built-up brace members display that the usage of vertical stitch connectors (parallel to the webs) should be avoided in all BSCBF systems in comparison with lateral-stitch braces (parallel to the flanges). In addition, the failure results of double-channel back-to-back BSCBFs are much better than those of similar face-to-face ones. The results of the double-angle diagonal braces also reveal that the failures of the back-to-back brace sections occur earlier in comparison with similar face-to-face or toe-to-toe braces.

AB  - An annulus is, informally, a ring-shaped region, often described by two concentric circles. The maximum-width empty annulus problem asks to find an annulus of a certain shape with the maximum possible width that avoids a given set of n points in the plane. This problem can also be interpreted as the problem of finding an optimal location of a ring-shaped obnoxious facility among the input points. In this paper, we study square and rectangular variants of the maximum-width empty anuulus problem, and present first nontrivial algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms run in O (n(3)) and O (n(2) log n) time for computing a maximum-width empty axis-parallel square and rectangular annulus, respectively.

AB  - Knee flexor and extensor muscular assessment via isokinetic dynamometry is common practice and established in the research literature. However, reporting assessment methodology regarding reciprocal and nonreciprocal movements is often vague or absent. Such methodological issues are crucial for accurate assessments. Therefore, knee extensor and flexor peak moment using either reciprocal movement or nonreciprocal modalities was assessed. Fifteen participants performed three blocks of five concentric muscle actions at three angular velocities [1: nonreciprocal (maximal active flexion followed by passive extension); B2: reciprocal (maximal active extension followed by maximal active flexion); B3 nonreciprocal (maximal active extension followed by passive flexion)]. ANOVA revealed statistically significant within-subject modality effects for peak knee extensor moment and flexor velocity and modality differences (p < .05). Reciprocal and nonreciprocal assessments give significantly different results, with nonreciprocal giving higher peak moments. Reporting which modality is used is crucial to allow for greater clarity for the reader and practitioner.

AB  - The anthropology of risks and disasters has been characterized in recent years by a strong focus on aspects of contemporary life, also developing a lively interdisciplinary vocation. The subject of these studies is multifaceted and complex, because during an emergency, or its future planning, there are political and legal discussions that can involve a multitude of actors, including lawyers, consultants, groups formed to represent victims or residents, social movements, businessmen, politicians, public officials and journalists. These figures contribute to the social construction of disaster, or risk, so anthropology can help to untangle these relationships.
   Similar dynamics are observable even before a disaster, as in the case of my contribution: Vesuvius has not erupted in 75 years and volcanologists say that it will remain dormant for a long time, however since 1995 a planning of the future volcanic eruption has been initiated that has changed the relationship of residents with the territory, as well as with time. On the one hand, in the same year, the creation of the Vesuvius National Park, within a layout concentric to the red zone, further regulated the use and attendance of the territory; on the other hand, with the emergency planning, the future catastrophe has been transformed: it is no longer a hypothetical eventuality but, in a sense, it is officially announced. In other words, the scenarios of the future have begun to influence the present time: they produce norms, establish behaviors, determine relationships, and become reality. The Vesuvius Emergency Plan and the Evacuation Plan are "governmental devices", or "non-human social actors" that, in addition to producing a regulated space and time, determine the daily practices of the residents and their conception of the situation in which they live.
   This has helped to model various social elaborations of risk, which I discuss in my contribution, underlining how there are associations and communities that do not ignore the risk, nor have a fatalistic attitude, but are active to rebuild a more equitable and sustainable relationship between humans and the ecosystem. Through the ethnographic approach, the need emerged to overcome the emergency logic and to induce public institutions to work also on risk mitigation, i.e. by fostering democratic participation, requalifying cities, taking action to eliminate social vulnerability; in other words, the inhabitants of the Vesuvian area are not indifferent to the threat of the volcano, but they have a different and differentiated approach that questions some simplifications on the "prevention society", the "risk culture" and a certain way of understanding "development".

AB  - Invaded, displaced, and dispossessed, the aboriginal Khoisan populations of South Africa were enslaved and pushed to the margins of society well before the arrival of European settlers in the seventeenth century; actually, the Bantu groups which had invaded southern Africa in the previous centuries had colonised various regions, due to their physical and military superiority. In contemporary South Africa, the condition of these people is still precarious, judging from the various forms of political protest reclaiming full citizenship for Khoisan communities. In some cases, however, the rereading of History on the part of minority groups to obtain social and political recognition tends to reproduce, and therefore to confirm, the stereotypes and simplifications that contributed to their marginalisation in the first place. The case of the Khoikhoi populations in South Africa - classified as 'coloured', but still claiming specific ethnic identities of their own - is read here through the lens of literature, and specifically through the novel David's Story by Zoe Wicomb - a South African writer who has always avoided the trap of simplism both as narrator and as social and literary critic.

   Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to control (n = 15; 67.5 +/- 2.6 yrs) and ET (n = 15; 69.0 +/- 4.4 yrs) groups. The ET group completed 1 week of familiarization and 8 weeks of training on an eccentric step machine. Participants completed two, 5-15 minute sessions per week, with RPE-based intensity. Pre-, mid-, and post-training assessments were conducted for the 30-second sit-to-stand (30CST), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), single leg stance with eyes closed (SLS-EC), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), and maximal eccentric strength (MES).
   Results: Significant improvements in 30CST, BBS, FGA, and TUG performance were observed for the ET group only (p < .05).
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence that 8-weeks of progressive ET improves muscular fitness, gait characteristics, and overall physical function.

AB  - Concentric wire-driven mechanism (CWM) contains two nested tendon/cable-driven mechanisms (TMs). In the CWM, the lengths of the bending sections are controlled by the insertion of the TMs. This greatly expands the workspace and improved the trajectory following performance. However, its inverse kinematics and configuration planning are very challenging. Conventionally, only end position (excluding equally important end direction and task configuration) is considered to solve inverse kinematics and configurations of this type of manipulator. In this paper, a biarc method is proposed to resolve end position, end direction, and task configuration simultaneously for the concentric wire-driven manipulator. Firstly, configuration of the concentric wire-driven manipulator is parameterized by typical biarc parameters, such as total bending angle of outer nodes, total bending angle of inner nodes and desired direction vector. Then, task configuration optimization based on basic module parameters, end direction, and bending angle is detailed. Corresponding to a minimally invasive surgery, configurations can easily be designed and re-planned by adjusting above biarc parameters. Finally, trajectory tracking on large intestine examination through typical S configuration are simulated and experimented on the designed concentric wire-driven manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide reasonable solutions of kinematics and configuration planning. In addition, results also demonstrate that the concentric wire-driven manipulator can track desired trajectory in extremely confined space.

AB  - In this work, homogeneous gripping mechanical devices for connecting small-sized modular autonomous robots are described. The review of solutions of gripping and holding industrial mechanisms, and robotic switching mechanisms, as well as docking devices of space vehicles is given. The design of the connecting gripping mechanism of Mobile Autonomous Reconfigurable System (MARS) for coaxial conjugation of robots is proposed and it works in conjunction and passive modes to form modular structures. In the passive state, the working body of the mechanism forms a geometrical figure, which is suitable for connecting with identical device. In this case working body opens gripping mechanism and capture similar mechanism in the passive state. The proposed mechanism is based on the iris diaphragm, which prevents the uncontrolled displacement of the working body and stops the mechanism. It excludes the accidental rotation around the axis of the autonomous unit during operation in the formed structure. Infrared sensors (IR) were used for the concentric alignment of the axes of the connection devices. Sensors of this type estimate the distance and deflection angle of the opposed mechanism.

AB  - The mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) outer capsid is composed of 200 mu 1-sigma 3 heterohexamers and a maximum of 12 sigma 1 trimers. During cell entry, sigma 3 is degraded by luminal or intracellular proteases to generate the infectious subviral particle (ISVP). When ISVP formation is prevented, reovirus fails to establish a productive infection, suggesting proteolytic priming is required for entry. ISVPs are then converted to ISVP*s, which is accompanied by mu 1 rearrangements. The mu 1 and sigma 3 proteins confer resistance to inactivating agents; however, neither the impact on capsid properties nor the mechanism (or basis) of inactivation is fully understood. Here, we utilized T1L/T3D M2 and T3D/T1L S4 to investigate the determinants of reovirus stability. Both reassortants encode mismatched subunits. When mu 1-sigma 3 were derived from different strains, virions resembled wild-type particles in structure and protease sensitivity. T1L/T3D M2 and T3D/T1L S4 ISVPs were less thermostable than wild-type ISVPs. In contrast, virions were equally susceptible to heating. Virion associated mu 1 adopted an ISVP*-like conformation concurrent with inactivation; sigma 3 preserves infectivity by preventing mu 1 rearrangements. Moreover, thermostability was enhanced by a hyperstable variant of mu 1. Unlike the outer capsid, the inner capsid (core) was highly resistant to elevated temperatures. The dual layered architecture allowed for differential sensitivity to inactivating agents.
   IMPORTANCE Nonenveloped and enveloped viruses are exposed to the environment during transmission to a new host. Protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions stabilize the particle and protect the viral genome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is composed of two concentric, protein shells. The mu 1 and sigma 3 proteins form the outer capsid; contacts between neighboring subunits are thought to confer resistance to inactivating agents. We further investigated the determinants of reovirus stability. The outer capsid was disrupted concurrent with the loss of infectivity; virion associated mu 1 rearranged into an altered conformation. Heat sensitivity was controlled by sigma 3; however, particle integrity was enhanced by a single mu 1 mutation. In contrast, the inner capsid (core) displayed superior resistance to heating. These findings reveal structural components that differentially contribute to reovirus stability.

AB  - Aim: To study the ultrasonographic (US) differences between "mununified" thyroid nodules and malignant thyroid nodules in order to achieve a more accurate imaging-based diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary biopsy. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the US features of mummified thyroid nodules, as confirmed by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), in 193 cases. The US features included content, echo, shape, margin, microcalcification, suspicious lymph nodes and some characteristic features, including the cystic wall shrinkage sign, the concentric configuration or finger sign, calcification and halo. All of these features were classified and compared with those of 109 malignant lesions. The changes of these mummified nodules during the follow-up period were also examined. Results: The cystic wall shrinkage sign and the concentric configuration or finger sip were highly specific indicators of mummified thyroid nodules and could be used to distinguish mummified nodules from thyroid cancer with a specificity of 91.7% and 99.9%, respectively. A continuous decrease in the cyst size was observed during follow-up. Conclusions: Mummified thyroid nodules are characterized by the cystic wall shrinkage sign and the concentric configuration or finger sign on US and a continuous decrease in size during follow-up. These features may be useful for the differential imaging-based diagnosis of mummified versus malignant thyroid nodules.

AB  - We propose a distributed approach to multi-aircraft real-time conflict resolution based on satisficing game theory which considers reducing flight collisions and improving economic efficiency. In our conflict game model, aircraft as exclusively self-interested agent are assigned different statuses by a priority ranking mechanism proposed. According to the state of one's own priority, they take others' preferences into consideration to choose the most satisficing conflict resolution strategy from policy set including speed and heading modification strategies. The simulation results on the random flight scenario of two concentric circles show that our method which adopts speed and heading adjustment to avoid conflicts is promising in terms of safety and system efficiency.

AB  - Minimally invasive procedures have gained ever-increasing popularity due to their advantages of smaller incisions, faster recoveries, fewer complications, and reduced scarring to name a few. With the force exertion and curvilinear flexibility at their distal end effectors, the continuum tubular robots have the potential to perform robot-assisted trans-orifice minimally invasive surgery, such as transnasal and transoral operations. During these procedures, it is important and challenging for the continuum tubular robot to automatically adjust its pose according to the target surgical sites and compensate for undesired disturbance, such as respiratory motions. In this paper, a singularity-avoidance visual servoing algorithm based on Jacobian Optimization has been proposed to improve safety and control continuum tubular robots based on intra-operative visual feedback in confined environments. Without the prior knowledge of robot kinematics or hand-eye calibration between the robot and the endoscope, the proposed model-free eye-in-hand visual servoing technique is capable of accomplishing the targeting tasks by adopting the safety-enhanced singularity avoidance mechanism and an efficient image-processing algorithm. The multiple experiments, including simulations, experiments conducted in a confined environment, and cadaveric studies, have been implemented and demonstrated to illustrate the superiority of the proposed singularity-avoidance visual servoing method.

AB  - Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) offers a promising way to obtain massive numbers of orthologous loci to understand phylogenetic relationships among organisms. Of particular interest are old museum specimens and other samples with degraded DNA, where traditional sequencing methods have proven to be challenging. Low coverage shotgun sequencing and sequence capture are two widely used NGS approaches for degraded DNA. Sequence capture can yield sequence data for large numbers of orthologous loci, but it can only be used to sequence genomic regions near conserved sequences that can be used as probes. Low coverage shotgun sequencing has the potential to yield different data types throughout the genome. However, many studies using this method have often generated mitochondrial sequences, and few nuclear sequences, suggesting orthologous nuclear sequences are likely harder to recover. To determine the phylogenetic position of the galliform genus Tropicoperdix, whose phylogenetic position is currently uncertain, we explored two strategies to maximize data extraction from low coverage shotgun sequencing from approximately 100-year-old museum specimens from two species of Tropicoperdix. One approach, a simple read mapping strategy, outperformed the other (a reduced complexity assembly approach), and allowed us to obtain a large number of ultraconserved element (UCE) loci, relatively conserved exons, more variable introns, as well as mitochondrial genomes. Additionally, we demonstrated some simple approaches to explore possible artifacts that may result from the use of degraded DNA. Our data placed Tropicoperdix within a Glade that includes many taxa characterized with ornamental eyespots (peafowl, argus pheasants, and peacock pheasants), and established relationships among species within the genus. Therefore, our study demonstrated that low coverage shotgun sequencing can easily be leveraged to yield substantial amounts and varying types of data, which opens the door for many research questions that might require information from different data types from museum specimens.

AB  - Thermal cloaks can thermally hide an object without disturbing background thermal field. The coordinate transformation method for designing conventional thermal cloaks face some challenges that the physical properties of metamaterials are required to be anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Furthermore, the coordinate transformation is not applicable for complex geometrical conditions. In this study, a proactive thermal cloak is proposed. The cloak contains two concentric annular zones: one with high thermal conductivity and another with adaptive heat source. The cloaked zone is surrounded by the high thermal conductivity zone. The high thermal conductivity zone keeps the object in the cloaked zone from thermally being affected by outside zones. The heat source zone adjusts the background thermal field without any distortion. The thermal cloak with an analytical heat source distribution is presented for the 2D and 3D background thermal fields with uniform gradient. The adaptive heat source in the thermal cloak is designed by inverse problem theory of a numerical method for the 2D arbitrary background thermal field. This proactive thermal cloak can avoid the issue of anisotropic physical properties for the conventional thermal cloak designed with coordinate transformation method. The heat source thermal cloak with relatively easy implementation can manipulate temperature field proactively without contact. This thermal cloak is applicable for arbitrary background thermal fields and complex geometrical conditions by a numerical design approach. The proposed thermal cloak opens a new strategy to manipulate the thermal field with adaptive heat source. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cities are suffering various ecological risks due to rapid urbanization and global climate change. Urban landscape ecological risk assessment is conducive to identifying high risk areas and guiding risk prevention. However, few studies have characterized the dynamic processes of landscape ecological risk. In this study, taking Beijing City as a case study, the adaptive cycle in resilience theory was incorporated into a risk assessment framework using such three criteria as potential, connectedness, and resilience, together with integrating exposure and disturbance effects of risk sources. This framework contributed to understanding the complex interactions between landscapes and risk effects from a holistic and dynamic view. The results showed that the ecological risk of "potential" and "connectedness" weakened radially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The distributions of "resilience", "exposure", "disturbance", and the final risk, all exhibited a concentric pattern of the higher risk, highest risk, and lowest risk sequentially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The results reflected the facts that residents living in downtowns had taken ecological restoration measures to reduce risk, while continuous urban constructions in outer suburbs increased the risk. In terms of the adaptive cycle phases of ecological risk, Yanqing, Miyun, Huairou, Mentougou, Fangshan and Pinggu districts were in the reorganization alpha-phase; Daxing, Changping, Shunyi and Tongzhou districts were in the exploitation r-phase; Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Haidian, Chaoyang and Shijingshan districts were in the conservation K-phase. The results provided scientifically spatial guidance for implementing resilient urban planning, in order to realize sustainable development of metropolitan areas.

AB  - Descriptions of the interactions between volcano plumbing systems and early-stage rift systems dominated by large half grabens and tilted fault blocks are scarce and lack detail. 3-D seismic reflection data across the Early Miocene-age subduction-related Kora Volcano plumbing system in the Taranaki Basin, offshore New Zealand, provides an opportunity to investigate in detail how this system has interacted with a Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene rift system. The shallow (<8-km-depth) architecture of intrusions are dominated by stacked saucer-shaped, and transgressive sills, and laccolith complexes distributed in an oval shape around the volcano. The thickest sill complexes occur in the thickest (fault-controlled) syn-rift depocenters. There is also local elongation of sill complexes in a N-S direction following structural trends. Numerous sills locally follow segments of large normal faults, or terminate at the faults. Laterally extensive sill complexes tend to lie close to the base of the syn-rift/top of pre-rift contact for distances up to 15 km away from the Kora Volcano. A general pattern is that the lowest-level sills are the most laterally extensive, and the shallower sills lie closer to the volcano. Shallow sills form a complex of concentric sills that dip away from the volcano center (ring sills). Sills are interpreted to have been fed by intrusions following faults that intersect a broad upper crustal magma chamber with a calculated area of similar to 345 km(2). Strong preference for sill/laccolith stacking in the thick syn-rift section appears to have had four effects. (1) In the upper 6 km there probably was not a simple single pipe feeding the volcano, instead the volcano is inferred to have been fed by a network of sills linked by short dikes and pipes. (2) The extensive intrusions resulted in folding/doming of the Paleogene section in several places, but most significantly under the central part of the volcano. (3) Much of the magma was stored in intrusive complexes within the syn-rift section and the underlying magma chamber (volume similar to 124 km(3)), not extruded (volume similar to 40 km(3)). (4) Edifice construction and broad doming related to subsurface intrusions may have caused the crest of the volcano to become subaerial. The consequent absence of phreatomagmatic eruptions and the extensive accumulation of magma in relatively thin sill complexes (that could cool relatively rapidly and solidify) avoided a destructive end to the volcanic edifice.

AB  - Biological microswimmers exhibit versatile strategies for sensing and navigating their environment, such as run-and-tumble and curvature modulation. Here, we report a striking phototactic behaviour of the microswimmer Euglena gracilis, where these eukaryotic cells swim in polygonal trajectories due to a sudden increase in light intensity. While smoothly curved trajectories are common for microswimmers, such quantized ones have not been reported previously. We find that this polygonal behaviour emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming and spinning behaviours. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection and cellular reorientation, accounting for all three behavioural states. Coordinated switching between these behaviours selects for ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive or subdiffusive motion (including tuning the effective diffusion constant over several orders of magnitude), thereby enabling navigation in spatially structured light fields, such as edge avoidance and gradient descent. This feedback control links multiple system scales (flagellar beats, cellular behaviours and phototaxis strategies), with implications for other natural and synthetic microswimmers.

AB  - Material signals in the form of surface topographies, proved to be potent regulators of cell functions and fate, through mechanotransduction pathways. While a wealth of data is related to regular topographic patterns, i.e., lines, pit, or protrusions, there are comparatively few studies addressing the effects of circular, concentric patterns. Yet, curvatures affecting cell shape dramatically alter cell contractility and behavior. Additionally, the vast majority of patterned surfaces are static in nature and this prevents to understand how cells perceive and respond to the topographic patterns. Here, a technique is exploited for dynamically embossing micrometerscale circular pattern on azopolymeric substrates using a confocal laser microscope and it is analyzed how NIH-3T3 reacts to the underlying topography in terms of changes in shape and mechanical properties. A characteristic pattern arrangement is found which most effectively alters cell morphology and orientation. Cells perceive the concentric pattern and reconfigure as fast as 2 h after pattern inscription. The changes in morphology also reflect dramatic changes in cell mechanics and cytoskeletal arrangements. The reported method is useful to manipulate cell shape and mechanics in a facile and cost-effective manner and most importantly enables investigate mechanotransduction events dynamically.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare mechanical muscle function in the eccentric/concentric phases of vertical bilateral jumping in or cruciate ligament-reconstructed (ACLR), elite (ELITE), and adolescent (ADOL) alpine ski racers and ski cross athletes.
   Methods: Alpine ski racers/skicrossers (ACLR: n = 12, age = 26.7 +/- 3.8years; ELITE: n = 12, age = 23.9 +/- 3.0 years; ADOL: n = 12, age = 17.8 +/- 0.7 years; females: n = 6 per group, males: n = 6 per group) performed 5 maximal countermovement jumps (CMJs) and 5 squat jumps. The ground reaction forces for each limb were analyzed using dual force plate recording to obtain body center of mass (BCM) velocity, displacement, and power. The eccentric deceleration (ECC) and concentric phases were determined from BCM velocity. CMJ net concentric and ECC impulses were calculated (body mass normalized) along with the peak and mean BCM power and maximal vertical jump height. CMJ lower limb stiffness (LLS) was determined by the slope of the ground reaction forces vs. the BCM displacement curve over the ECC phase. Concentric and ECC asymmetry indices were calculated for each leg, and the left vs. right LLS was compared. Outcome measures (reported as mean +/- SD) calculated as a 5 jump mean were normalized to body mass and compared using an analysis of variance.
   Results: No between-group differences were found for peak and mean power or jump heights. There were no group differences for LLS or net concentric phase impulse, but the net ECC impulse was lower in the ADOL group compared with ELITE skiers (ADOL: 1.33 +/- 0.32 Ns/kg; ELITE: 1.59 +/- 0.16 Ns/kg; p< 0.05). Although no group differences were found for ECC asymmetry indices, a group x limb interaction was found for LLS (p< 0.01), which was systematically higher in the right vs. the left limb of ADOL skiers (right: 54.1 +/- 17.9 N/m/kg; left: 48.7 +/- 15.7 N/m/kg; p< 0.01).
   Conclusion: ADOL skiers demonstrated decreased ECC impulse and systematic right limb dominance in LLS compared with ACLR and ELITE skiers. The implication of these findings for injury and performance are unknown, but further investigation into these potential relationships is warranted.

AB  - Body fossils are described for the first time from the Upper Brioverian (Ediacaran-Fortunian) deposits of Central Brittany (NW France). The material consists of a dozen of specimens preserved on two slates, recently collected in a quarry in Saint-Gonlay. The fossils, centimetric in size, have an elliptical and acuminated outline, with a peripheral bulge but without conspicuous concentric or radial lines. These body fossils are preserved in slates that are locally rich in grazing traces, sometimes associated with microbial mats. The sedimentological characteristics of these deposits correspond to a shallow marine shelf environment, with a low to moderate hydrodynamism. Such findings, in concomitance with previous ichnological discoveries, unravel the potential of the Brioverian strata from Brittany as a new locality to provide answers on Ediacaran and early Cambrian biocenoses.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is the raw material for selection that is ubiquitous for most traits in natural populations, yet the processes underlying phenotypic evolution or stasis often remain unclear. Here, we report phenotypic evolution in a mutant line of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana after outcrossing with the genetically polymorphic wild type population. The comet mutation modifies two phenotypic traits known to be under sexual selection in this butterfly: the dorsal forewing eyespots and the pheromone-producing structures. The original comet mutant line was inbred and remained phenotypically stable for at least seven years, but when outcrossed to the wild type population the outcrossed comet line surprisingly recovered the wild type phenotype within 8 generations at high (27 degrees C), but not at low (20 degrees C), developmental temperatures. Male mating success experiments then revealed that outcrossed comet males with the typical comet phenotype suffered from lower mating success, while mating success of outcrossed comet males resembling wild types was partially restored. We document a fortuitous case where the addition of genetic polymorphism around a spontaneous mutation could have allowed partial restoration of phenotypic robustness. We further argue that sexual selection through mate choice is likely the driving force leading to phenotypic robustness in our system.

AB  - The mammalian intervertebral disc (IVD) consists of a gel-like, disordered nucleus pulposus (NP) surrounded by a highly ordered collagen structure, the annulus fibrosus (AF). While this concentric array of lamellae has been amply studied, its physical origin is poorly understood. The notochord is a rod-like organ located in the mid-line of the growing embryo and plays an essential role in IVD development. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of notochord development on the collagen fiber arrangement evolution in the AF. To that end, we studied IVD development in mouse embryos and compared these observations to those from chicken embryos, which do not form the typical laminar structure around the NP. In mouse, cross-aligned collagen arrangement of the AF forms from the sclerotome upon bulging of the notochord to become NP. By contrast, the notochord in the chicken embryo swells substantially without the physical restrictions of the future vertebrae and thus do not bulge. From these observations, we conclude that physical and geometrical constrictions are essential for the formation of the highly structured AF. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a general mechanistic model of mass diffusion for a composite sphere placed in a large ambient medium. The multi-layer problem is described by a system of diffusion equations coupled via interlayer boundary conditions such as those imposing a finite mass resistance at the extemal surface of the sphere. While the work is applicable to the generic problem of heat or mass transfer in a multi-layer sphere, the analysis and results are presented in the context of drug kinetics for desorbing and absorbing spherical microcapsules. We derive an analytical solution for the concentration in the sphere and in the surrounding medium that avoids any artificial truncation at a finite distance. The closed-form solution in each concentric layer is expressed in terms of a suitably-defined inverse Laplace transform that can be evaluated numerically. Concentration profiles and drug mass curves in the spherical layers and in the external environment are presented and the dependency of the solution on the mass transfer coefficient at the surface of the sphere analyzed.

AB  - The close homology of monkeys and humans has increased the prevalence of non-human-primate models in functional MRI studies of brain connectivity. To improve upon the attainable resolution in functional MRI studies, a commensurate increase in the sensitivity of the radiofrequency receiver coil is required to avoid a reduction in the statistical power of the analysis. Most receive coils are comprised of multiple loops distributed equidistantly over a surface to produce spatially independent sensitivity profiles. A larger number of smaller elements will in turn provide a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the same field of view. As the loops become physically smaller, noise originating from the sample is reduced relative to noise originating from the coil. In this coil-noise-dominated regime, coil elements can have overlapping sensitivity profiles, yet still possess only mildly correlated noise. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that inductively decoupled, concentric coil arrays can improve temporal SNR when operating in the coil-noise-dominated regime-in contrast to what is expected for the more ubiquitous sample-noise-dominated array. A small, thin, 7-channel flexible coil is developed and operated in conjunction with an existing whole-head monkey coil. The mean and maximum noise correlation between the two arrays was 5% and 23%, respectively. When the flex coil was placed over the sensorimotor cortex, the temporal SNR improved by up to 2.3-fold in the peripheral cortex and up to 1.3-fold at a 2- to 3-cm depth within the brain. When the flex coil was placed over the frontal eye fields, resting-state maps showed substantially elevated sensitivity to correlations in the prefrontal cortex (54%), supplementary eye fields (39%), and anterior cingulate cortex (41%). The concentric-coil topology provided a pragmatic and robust means to significantly improve local temporal SNR and the statistical power of functional connectivity maps.

AB  - Two-dimensional flow around semi-circular cylinder at zero angle of attack and at Re = 50000 during the self oscillatory regime has been extensively studied within the URANS method with the use of different-structure grids (multiblock, structured overlapping, unstructured composite), the SST turbulence model and its versions (1993) and (2003) considering the streamline curvature influence modified within the Rodi-Leschziner-Isaev approach and numerical different-approximation methods realized in two codes (VP2/3, Fluent). Experiments have been made on flow around a semi-circular cylinder in the wind tunnel of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, Institute of Mechanics to obtain data for verification of numerical predictions. The double-mode character of a periodic time history of a drag force caused by a periodically forming and disappearing jet flap and acting upon a body is explained. With increasing compressibility at a Mach number ranging from 0 to 0.5, it is observed that periodic flow around the semi-circular cylinder is restructured, and the time history of the drag force acting upon it is described by a dependence close to a sinusoidal one. It is found that, as the Mach number is increased, pressure field distortions in the form of concentric cylindrical waves propagating from the semi-circular cylinder and the vortex street behind it grow over the infrasonic range.

AB  - Eccentric contraction-induced quadriceps strains, particularly in the rectus femoris (RF), frequently occur in sports. By using MRI-based transverse relaxation time (T-2) as an index of exercise-induced muscle edema, previous studies found pronounced damage in RF after an acute single-joint eccentric knee extension exercise. This study examined whether single-joint eccentric knee extension training would preferentially train RF, resulting in greater hypertrophy of RF than the other quadriceps muscles. Twelve males conducted work-matched single-joint isokinetic (180 degrees /s) maximal eccentric contractions of the knee extensors in one leg (ECC-leg) and concentric in the other (CON-leg), six sets/session (3-5 sets in the initial 1-3 sessions), two sessions/wk for 10 weeks. Muscle volume of each quadriceps was measured pre- and post-training. T-2 of each muscle was assessed weekly throughout the training period and pre- and post-training. Muscle volume significantly increased in all muscles in ECC-leg only, with a greater degree for RF (+7.3%) than the vasti (2.9%-3.7%). T-2 did not change in all muscles throughout. These results suggest that RF can be preferentially trained by single-joint eccentric knee extension training. Cooperatively with the potential repeated bout effect (ie, protective effect) in eccentric exercise, this training modality would have positive implications for strain injury prevention of RF.

AB  - The Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) is an active volcanic system characterized by significant long- and short-term ground deformation phenomena ranging the maxima values in the central sector of the caldera, where La Starza marine terrace is located. A detailed study of the La Starza provided crucial clues for understanding the resurgence of the central sector of the caldera following the 15-ka Neapolitan Yellow Tuff eruption. The doming of the caldera floor, marked by two primary episodes of uplift, began soon after the collapse of about 110m following the eruption. The first doming (15-9.2ka) occurred as a response to loss of lithostatic loading producing magma influx, possibly regulated by thermal magmatic convection and chaotic movement inside the magma reservoir under the caldera. The calculated similar to 90m of structural uplift is the persistent displacement correlated with magma volumes intruded accompanying the contemporaneous volcanic activity. The second episode of uplift (5.5-3.8ka) produced a ground deformation pattern similar to that measured during recent unrest crises suggesting a stable and shallow (similar to 4-km deep) source of strain like a sill in an elastic half space. By this geometry and inversion of surface deformation, the volume of intruded material was determined. Simply varying pressure history as input, the time history of the surface deformation was reproduced by using spherical source geometry with a concentric viscoelastic shell 8-km deep. The satisfactory comparison between the two models is a useful indication for interpreting the current unrest phase at the Campi Flegrei caldera.
   Caldera-forming eruptions may reflect either large magma bodies that are ephemeral and develop only rarely or eruption of silicate melt that is relatively dispersed rather than concentrated in a single magmatic mass. In the last 15ka Campi Flegrei caldera produced a large eruption, the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff 15,000years ago, and many smaller eruptions. Contemporary Ground deformation occurred ranging for hundreds of meters suggesting accumulation of large mass of magma at shallow depth. The historical eruption of Monte Nuovo (1538) is the only one in the last 2,000years, since the Romans permanently occupied the area: a very poor performance if it is associated with the previous sequences. In the last decades a slow lifting is affecting the area (which is going up since 15,000years): a natural warning has been launched and the community has been alerted.

AB  - Hamstring strains are the most common injury in multiple sprint sports, with inadequate eccentric hamstring strength and fatigue identified as important risk factors. Resistance training interventions aimed at reducing injury risk typically focus on the development of maximum strength, while little is known about the impact of training on hamstring fatigue resistance. The present study compared the effects of strength endurance (SE) with a strength intervention (S) on the eccentric hamstring strength decline induced by a simulated soccer match. Twenty-one female soccer players were randomly assigned to a S group (n = 10) or a SE group (n = 11). Hamstrings and quadriceps isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque (PT) were assessed at 120 degrees.s(-1) and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (HEcc:QCon) calculated, pre- and immediately post a 90-min simulated match (BEAST90). This was repeated following a 7-week intervention of either three to five sets of 6RM leg curl and stiff-leg deadlift with 3-min inter-set rest (5), or the same exercises performed using three sets of 12-20 RM with 45-90 s inter-set rest (SE). At baseline, the simulated match led to significant declines in hamstrings eccentric peak torque (EccPT) in both groups in both dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) legs [SE: (D: -15.5, ND: -15.6%), P = 0.001 to 0.016; S: (D: -12.3%, ND: -15.5%), P = 0.001 to 0.018]. After the 7-week intervention, we observed a group*intervention*match interaction such that there was no significant decline in EccPT in the SE group following the simulated match (D: 5.3%, ND: 2.0%), but there remained significant declines in the S group (D: -14.2%, ND: -15.5%, P = 0.018-0.001). Similarly, in the SE group, there was a significant decrease in the HEcc:QCon in D before (-14.2%, P = 0.007), but not after the training intervention, whereas declines were observed in the S group both at baseline, and following the intervention (D: -13.9%, ND: -15.6%, P = 0.045). These results demonstrate that SE training can reduce the magnitude of the EccPT decline observed during soccer competition. As inadequate eccentric strength and fatigue are both risk factors for hamstring injury, SE training should be considered along with the development of peak eccentric strength, as a component of programs aimed at reducing injury risk in multiple-sprint sports.

AB  - Recently, the combination of a press-fit acetabular cup and ceramic articulation has been widely used for implanting cementless acetabular components and has been shown to provide good initial stability. However, this combination may lead to the failure of ceramic liners by their non-concentric seating due to acetabular cup deformation. To reduce the risk of this, we applied direct metal tooling (DMT)-based additive manufacturing (AM) with the hypothesis that DMT-based AM would minimize the deformation of the acetabular cup by increasing its strength, which would ultimately prevent the ceramic liner from fracturing. To confirm this, we performed post-fatigue tests simulating a press-fit situation for the acetabular cups subjected to DMT-based AM and compared them with the cups treated with titanium plasma spray (TPS). The post-fatigue tests were then performed under a maximum load of 14 kN for 20 x 10(7) cycles. The roundness and inner diameter of the cups and liners were measured in all testing phases. The results revealed no differences between the acetabular cups subjected to DMT-based AM and TPS. However, when comparing only the mean values directly, the results for the acetabular cup subjected to DMT-based AM indicated that it might have increased the strength of the acetabular cup, compared with those treated with TPS, thereby minimizing the possibility of fracture of the ceramic liner. In conclusion, DMT-based AM was shown to be at least equivalent to TPS, or could possibly supersede it. Additionally, via DMT-based AM, it is possible to control the porous structure freely, so this approach allows a greater range of applications and potential for further improvement than TPS.

AB  - Purpose: Fatigue negatively alters dynamic knee control, and the functional hamstring/quadriceps ratio (H/Q(FUNC)) plays an important role in stabilizing the joint. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soccer-specific exercise on H/Q(FUNC) in under (U) 13-, U15-, and U 17-year-old female soccer players. Methods: A total of 36 female players performed concentric and eccentric actions of the hamstrings at 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and 180 degrees/s before and after an age group-specific field-based soccer protocol. H/Q(FUNC) was determined in the first 30 degrees of knee flexion. Results: Significant angle x velocity (P = .001) and time x angle (P = .033) interaction effects were found indicating a lower H/Q(FUNC) with increased movement velocity at 0 degrees-10 degrees as opposed to greater knee flexion angles. Fatigue-related effects were only evident near full knee extension. Probabilistic inferences indicated that changes in H/Q(FUNC) were generally unclear in U13s, likely detrimental in U15s, and very likely beneficial in U17s. Conclusions: Altered muscular control following soccer-specific exercise is age dependent with players' 1-year post-peak height velocity at greatest risk of injury. Injury prevention and screening need to be age and maturation appropriate, should consider the effects of fatigue, and include movements near full extension.

AB  - Analytical representations of the flows associated with doubly periodic arrangements of point singularities of two-dimensional Stokes flow are derived. The analysis makes use of a conformal mapping from a concentric annulus to a rectangle. A natural mathematical object known as the Schottky-Klein prime function is used to derive the solutions avoiding the theory of elliptic functions. The new expressions have the advantage of being immediately amenable to fast evaluation without the need for Ewald or other fast summation methods or acceleration techniques for lattice sums.

AB  - Low-ductility steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are widely used in buildings as a lateral resistance system in seismic regions around the world due to their high stiffness and strength. Steel CBF buildings have been observed to have reserve capacity after brace fracture in past earthquakes. However, it is difficult for most practicing engineers to evaluate the contribution of the reserve system to the collapse prevention performance of CBF buildings because of its complex inelastic behavior. This study proposes a method to define the reserve system of multistory low-ductility CBF buildings for earthquake loads by performing a static pushover analysis. The multistory CBF building is converted to an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) CBF system with induced reserve parameters. A simple mathematical model describing the ductility response spectra for the reserve system in moderate seismic regions is established from the results of an extensive parametric study employing the SDOF mode to represent multistory CBF buildings. The collapse prevention capacity of the reserve system for a multistory CBF building can be evaluated by comparing the period of the multistory CBF system with a threshold value. The proposed approach is validated by application to buildings in two case studies. The results demonstrate that the reserve capacity of a multistory CBF plays an important role in collapse prevention. This simplified procedure is intended for a rapid evaluation on the multistory CBF system using an approximate seismic response.

AB  - The requirement to safe and economical buildings caused to the exploitation of nonlinear capacity structures and optimization of them. This requirement leads to forming seismic design method based on performance. In this study, concentrically braced frames (CBFs) have been optimized at the immediate occupancy (IO) and collapse prevention (CP) levels. Minimizing structural weight is taken as objective function subjected to performance constraints on inter-story drift ratios at various performance levels. In order to evaluate the seismic capacity of the CBFs, pushover analysis is conducted, and the process of optimization has been done by using Bee Algorithm. Results indicate that performance based design caused to have minimum structural weight and due to increase capacity of CBFs.

AB  - This paper presents simulations of stationary and transient (fault condition) regimes for a three-phase concentric HTS cable with and without a standalone superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). The stationary study carried out previously to the transient analysis verifies the viability of the proposed cable design. The response of the HTS cable to fault currents by varying the thickness of copper stabilization layers is analyzed. As an option, an SFCL is supposed to be connected in series to the same HTS cable to investigate if and how an SFCL device could protect the HTS cable as well as the power network. Results show that fault currents can be limited by adapting the copper layer thickness of the HTS tapes in the cable, but this may result in too high temperatures in the coolant. Only a carefully designed SFCL device can prevent longer cable outages or even damages in the HTS cable caused by too high temperatures.

AB  - Rugby league is a high-intensity sport with large impact forces sustained during play, resulting in high prevalence of shoulder injury. Consequently, shoulder strength and player power are important considerations for injury prevention and performance. Additionally, professional teams regularly compete against semiprofessional teams, where differences in physical conditioning could be marked. The aim of this study was to test for differences in glenohumeral joint rotation and peak power between a professional Super League (SL) and semiprofessional Rugby League Championship (RLC) teams. A cross-sectional analysis was used to test 25 SL and 24 RLC players during preseason training. Isokinetic dynamometry, at 240 degrees.s(-1) for concentric and eccentric actions was used to assess glenohumeral rotation. Peak power was determined using a maximal 30-second cycle ergometer test. Selective muscular development of the internal rotators without concomitant external rotator strength was evident in the SL team but not the RLC team. Internal rotation peak torque was higher for the SL club for concentric (similar to 24%) and eccentric (similar to 16%) muscle actions (p < 0.05), and this contributed to a lower ipsilateral reciprocal muscle group ratio (external to internal concentric) for the SL team compared with the RLC team (similar to 47% and similar to 60% respectively; p <= 0.05). Peak power output was also higher for the SL team (1,409 +/- 153 vs. 1,273 +/- 159 W; p <= 0.05). The results highlight a mismatch in the physical conditioning of SL and RLC players with implications for practitioners to design strength and conditioning programs that minimize the risk of injury while optimizing performance.

AB  - Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices have adverse impacts on the performance of distance relays (DRs) due to the fast intervention of the controllers of these devices during power swing. Power swing blocker (PSB) as the complementary part in a DR is designed to distinguish a fault from a power swing; meanwhile its performance in compensated lines needs to be investigated. The performance of concentric PSB (CPSB) is studied in transmission lines compensated by unified power flow controller (UPFC). It is shown that fast responses of proportional-integral (PI) controllers of UPFC, reduce recorded time by CPSB significantly (it decreases by 90% of uncompensated condition) which makes DR to issue trip command during power swing condition. Detailed model of UPFC is simulated in three-machine and New England power systems to show the deficiency of CPSB in compensated condition. In order to overcome the deficiency of the CPSB in UPFC-compensated line, two remedial actions are proposed. The first method is based on modifying CPSB to solve the problem and the second method is based on modifying control loop of UPFC to prevent the problem. Both methods show their efficiency to overcome the deficiency.

AB  - We study periodically driven Taylor-Couette turbulence, i.e. the flow confined between two concentric, independently rotating cylinders. Here, the inner cylinder is driven sinusoidally while the outer cylinder is kept at rest (time-averaged Reynolds number is Re-i = 5 x 10(5)). Using particle image velocimetry, we measure the velocity over a wide range of modulation periods, corresponding to a change in Womersley number in the range 15 <= W-0 <= 114. To understand how the flow responds to a given modulation, we calculate the phase delay and amplitude response of the azimuthal velocity. In agreement with earlier theoretical and numerical work, we find that for large modulation periods the system follows the given modulation of the driving, i.e. the behaviour of the system is quasi-stationary. For smaller modulation periods, the flow cannot follow the modulation, and the flow velocity responds with a phase delay and a smaller amplitude response to the given modulation. If we compare our results with numerical and theoretical results for the laminar case, we find that the scalings of the phase delay and the amplitude response are similar. However, the local response in the bulk of the flow is independent of the distance to the modulated boundary. Apparently, the turbulent mixing is strong enough to prevent the flow from having radius-dependent responses to the given modulation.

AB  - Following its eradication in the Alps in the early 1900s, the Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus has been reintroduced in four Alpine regions since 1986. The first successful breeding since this reintroduction into the wild occurred in 1997 in the western Alps, and in 1998 in the Central Alps, thereby establishing two subpopulations. Here, we focus on the growth and the settlement patterns of one of the major subpopulations of reintroduced Bearded Vulture, that of the Central Alps. By 2015 there were 15 breeding pairs in the Central Alps, and the density within the core area was strikingly higher (18.8 pairs/1000 km(2)) than that outside it (overall density 3.4 pairs/1000 km(2)). New pairs showed high natal philopatry when settling, with maximum distances of 49.2 km from the nearest release sites. Among identified birds, born or released within the Central Alps, 85% (n = 26) paired and settled within this subpopulation and only four birds emigrated to the west. Three birds immigrated from the east or the west. Both the number of pairs and of offspring increased exponentially between 1998 and 2015. The growth of the Central Alpine subpopulation was characterized by concentric and continuous growth around the release sites. Moreover, there was an increase in the density of pairs within the core area. Possible explanations for the high natal philopatry observed include adaptive genetic components, abundant food resources and conspecific attraction. As a consequence of the substantial population increase, releases in the Central Alpine subpopulation were stopped after 2008. The population has grown almost exclusively on the basis of wild-born birds since then, and has become a major subpopulation of the Bearded Vulture in the Alps.

AB  - Purpose
   Traffic accidents are associated with the visual function of drivers, as well as many other factors. Driving simulator systems have the advantage of controlling for traffic-and automobile-related conditions, and using pinhole glasses can control the degree of concentric concentration of the visual field. We evaluated the effect of concentric constriction of the visual field on automobile driving, using driving simulator tests.
   Methods
   Subjects meeting criteria for normal eyesight were included in the study. Pinhole glasses with variable aperture sizes were adjusted to mimic the conditions of concentric visual field constrictions of 10 degrees and 15 degrees, using a CLOCK CHART (R). The test contained 8 scenarios (2 oncoming right-turning cars and 6 jump-out events from the side).
   Results
   Eighty-eight subjects were included in the study; 37 (mean age =52.9 +/- 15.8 years) subjects were assigned to the 15 degrees group, and 51 (mean =48.6 +/- 15.5 years) were assigned to the 10 degrees group. For all 8 scenarios, the number of accidents was significantly higher among pinhole wearing subjects. The average number of all types of accidents per person was significantly higher in the pinhole 10 degrees group (4.59 +/- 1.81) than the pinhole 15 degrees group (3.68 +/- 1.49) (P = 0.032). The number of accidents associated with jump-out scenarios, in which a vehicle approaches from the side on a straight road with a good view, was significantly higher in the pinhole 10 degrees group than in the pinhole 15 degrees group.
   Conclusions
   Concentric constriction of the visual field was associated with increased number of traffic accidents. The simulation findings indicated that a visual field of 10 degrees to 15 degrees may be important for avoiding collisions in places where there is a straight road with a good view.

AB  - Introduction: Soccer is the most popular and practiced sport in the world and is characterized by high intensity movements. This high demand induces several types of locomotor system injury, and one of the intrinsic factors responsible for triggering these injuries is muscle imbalances, which can occur between limbs or between muscles groups of the same limb. Objective:To evaluate the muscular performance between knee flexor/extensor groups of both limbs in professional soccer athletes.: Methods: Isokinetic assessments were performed in 18 professional soccer athletes, with mean age of 26.9 +/- 3.6 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.9 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2).. The test protocol consisted of five concentric contractions of knee flexion and extension at angular velocity of 60 degrees/sec, 15 contractions at 180 degrees/sec and 30 contractions at 300 degrees/sec in both limbs. Test paired t-test was used to verify the torque, power, and fatigue ratio of flexors and extensors of the dominant and non-dominant knee. Results: There was no significant difference between the evaluated members related to dominance (p>0.05). Regarding the torque ratio between flexors and extensors, we observed values below what is considered normal for this population, besides a higher fatigue index in knee flexor group when compared with the extensor group. Conclusion: No better performance was observed in the dominant limb, suggesting that, although this limb is preferred, this does not necessarily characterizes the better performance. The data also revealed an imbalance in the torque production capacity between the knee flexor and extensor groups, with an unfavorable ratio for the hamstrings, as well as a higher fatigue index in this group, which would make these muscles more susceptible to injures.

AB  - The diversity and sustainability of species composition are important topic of forest research. The possibility to observe the coexistence of tree species in a given forest patch and their succession in the next generation is limited because there are few forests unaffected by management activities. For this reason, the study was conducted in the oldest part of the Bialowieza National Park, called Strict Reserve. The purpose of the research was to determine the relationship between the quantity of individual tree species in the overstorey (the standing volume of trees with the diameter at breast height d >= 8 cm) and regeneration layer (the total height of trees with the diameter at breast height d<8 cm or height h <= 1.3 m) as well as the relationships between those stand layers. Multiple regression and canonical analysis were used to determine the relationships between 12 tree species (tab. 1). The research material was the results of measurements of 920 concentric sample plots conducted in 1995 and 2005. In the overstorey, the correlation coefficient between the standing volume of a given tree species on sample plots and the standing volume of other tree species assumed for each species both significant positive values (species 'co-occurrence'), significant negative values (species 'avoidance') and close to zero values (fig. 1). The same was true for the regeneration layer (fig. 2). In eight cases the correlation between the total height of trees of a given species in the regeneration layer and the standing volume of trees from the overstorey showed the highest positive values when referred to the 'regeneration-overstorey' relationship of the same species (fig. 3). The same referred to the 'overstorey-regeneration' relationship (fig. 4). Eight of the canonical variables turned out to be significant (tab. 2). For the first canonical variable, standing volume of hornbeam in the overstorey (Gb_m) showed the highest absolute value of the loading factor in the first dataset, while the variable the total height of hornbeam trees in the regeneration layer (Gb_o) - in the other dataset (fig. 5). The total redundancy was 20.7%, which means that such part of the variance of the total height of individual tree species in the regeneration layer could be explained by their standing volume in the overstorey. The sequence of tree generations understood as the relationship between species composition of the regeneration and overstorey layers was associated with life strategies of tree species.

AB  - Objective To examine the value of isokinetic strength assessment for predicting risk of hamstring strain injury, and to direct future research into hamstring strain injuries.
   Design Systematic review.
   Data sources Database searches for Medline, CINAHL, Embase, AMED, AUSPORT, SPORTDiscus, PEDro and Cochrane Library from inception to April 2017. Manual reference checks, ahead-of-press and citation tracking.
   Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Prospective studies evaluating isokinetic hamstrings, quadriceps and hip extensor strength testing as a risk factor for occurrence of hamstring muscle strain.
   Methods Independent search result screening. Risk of bias assessment by independent reviewers using Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Best evidence synthesis and meta-analyses of standardised mean difference (SMD).
   Results Twelve studies were included, capturing 508 hamstring strain injuries in 2912 athletes. Isokinetic knee flexor, knee extensor and hip extensor outputs were examined at angular velocities ranging 30-300 degrees/s, concentric or eccentric, and relative (Nm/kg) or absolute (Nm) measures. Strength ratios ranged between 30 degrees/s and 300 degrees/s. Meta-analyses revealed a small, significant predictive effect for absolute (SMD=-0.16, P=0.04, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.01) and relative (SMD=-0.17, P=0.03, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.014) eccentric knee flexor strength (60 degrees/s). No other testing speed or strength ratio showed statistical association. Best evidence synthesis found over half of all variables had moderate or strong evidence for no association with future hamstring injury.
   Summary/Conclusion Despite an isolated finding for eccentric knee flexor strength at slow speeds, the role and application of isokinetic assessment for predicting hamstring strain risk should be reconsidered, particularly given costs and specialised training required.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of buckling restrained brace systems (BRBs) on the overall structural stability against fire following a severe incident, which caused the failure of a column on the first storey of a steel building. A four-storey moment frame fitted with the inverted-V arrangement of braces is modelled, considering a multi-hazard approach. This technique concentrates on a structural plane frame that is designed to meet the progressive collapse criteria according to the U.S. Department of Defense guidelines and assumes that an extreme event damaged a first-storey centre column, before the exposure to an ensuing fire. The performance of BRBs in preventing the global collapse of the structure due to a post-event fire is compared with that of ordinary concentric brace systems (OCBs). The results indicate that BRBs offer a higher global collapse time to the building owing to the greater stiffness they provide to the structural frame. The fire resistance provided by BRBs is restricted to the participation of bracing elements and framing girders afterwards. In the case of OCBs, columns contribute to the structural resistance prior to the full capacity of braces used. To conclude, it is found that BRBs are more capable in maintaining the stability of a damaged building against fire resulting from an extreme event than OCBs.

AB  - During the late stages of rotavirus morphogenesis, the surface proteins VP4 and VP7 are assembled onto the previously structured double-layered virus particles to yield a triple-layered, mature infectious virus. The current model for the assembly of the outer capsid is that it occurs within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, it has been shown that VP4 and infectious virus associate with lipid rafts, suggesting that the final assembly of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 involves a post-endoplasmic reticulum event. In this work, we found that the actin inhibitor jasplakinolide blocks the cell egress of rotavirus from nonpolarized MA104 cells at early times of infection, when there is still no evidence of cell lysis. These findings contrast with the traditional assumption that rotavirus is released from nonpolarized cells by a nonspecific mechanism when the cell integrity is lost. Inspection of the virus present in the extracellular medium by use of density flotation gradients revealed that a fraction of the released virus is associated with low-density membranous structures. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of VP4, its interaction with lipid rafts, and its targeting to the cell surface were shown to be prevented by jasplakinolide, implying a role for actin in these processes. Finally, the VP4 present at the plasma membrane was shown to be incorporated into the extracellular infectious virus, suggesting the existence of a novel pathway for the assembly of the rotavirus spike protein.
   IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is a major etiological agent of infantile acute severe diarrhea. It is a nonenveloped virus formed by three concentric layers of protein. The early stages of rotavirus replication, including cell attachment and entry, synthesis and translation of viral mRNAs, replication of the genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the assembly of double-layered viral particles, have been studied widely. However, the mechanisms involved in the later stages of infection, i.e., viral particle maturation and cell exit, are less well characterized. It has been assumed historically that rotavirus exits nonpolarized cells following cell lysis. In this work, we show that the virus exits cells by a nonlytic, actin-dependent mechanism, and most importantly, we describe that VP4, the spike protein of the virus, is present on the cell surface and is incorporated into mature, infectious virus, indicating a novel pathway for the assembly of this protein.

AB  - A phase-retrieval attack free cryptosystem based on the cylindrical asymmetric diffraction and double-random phase encoding (DRPE) is proposed. The plaintext is abstract as a cylinder, while the observed diffraction and holographic surfaces are concentric cylinders. Therefore, the plaintext can be encrypted through a two-step asymmetric diffraction process with double pseudo random phase masks located on the object surface and the first diffraction surface. After inverse diffraction from a holographic surface to an object surface, the plaintext can be reconstructed using a decryption process. Since the diffraction propagated from the inner cylinder to the outer cylinder is different from that of the reversed direction, the proposed cryptosystem is asymmetric and hence is free of phase-retrieval attack. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed cryptosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adrenaline-deficient phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-knockout mice (Pnmt-KO) have concentric heart remodeling and though their resting blood pressure is normal, it becomes higher during acute exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiac morphological, functional and molecular alterations after chronic exercise in adrenaline-deficient mice. Genotypes at the Pnmt locus were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ear samples of Pnmt-KO and wild-type (WT) mice. These mice were submitted to chronic exercise training during 6 weeks. Blood pressure was determined by a photoelectric pulse detector. Mice were anesthetized and cardiac morphology and function were evaluated by echocardiography and hemodynamics. IGF-1, IGF-1R, ANP and BNP mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR in left ventricle (LV) samples. Pnmt-KO mice showed increased systolic blood pressure compared with WT mice. A significant increase was found in LV mass, and LV posterior wall thickness in trained Pnmt-KO compared to trained WT mice, without significant differences in LV volumes. Acute (beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine increased systolic function indexes in WT mice, but not in Pnmt-KO mice. LV expression of IGF-1 and ANP was increased in trained Pnmt-KO mice when compared to trained WT mice. In conclusion, in response to chronic exercise adrenaline-deficient Pnmt-KO mice show concentric LV hypertrophy and impaired response to dobutamine, suggesting an initial stage of pathological cardiac hypertrophic remodeling. These results support the need for an efficient partial conversion of noradrenaline into adrenaline for prevention of blood pressure overshoot and thus pathological cardiac hypertrophic remodeling in chronic exercise.

AB  - The goal of this article is two fold. First, using transcendental shift-like automorphisms of C-k, k >= 3 we construct two examples of non-degenerate entire mappings with prescribed ranges. The first example exhibits an entire mapping of C-k, k >= 3 whose range avoids a given polydisc but contains the complement of a slightly larger concentric polydisc. This generalizes a result of Dixon-Esterle in C-2. The second example shows the existence of a Fatou-Bieberbach domain in C-k, k >= 3 that is constrained to lie in a prescribed region. This is motivated by similar results of Buzzard and Rosay-Rudin. In the second part we compute the order and type of entire mappings that parametrize one dimensional unstable manifolds for shift-like polynomial automorphisms and show how they can be used to prove a Yoccoz type inequality for this class of automorphisms.

AB  - Developmental plasticity enables organisms to cope with environmental heterogeneity, such as seasonal variation in climatic conditions, and is thought to affect a species' capability to adapt to environments with novel seasonal and ecological dynamics. We studied developmental plasticity of the widespread tropical butterfly, Bicyclus safitza, which reaches the southern edge of its distribution in the temperate zone of South Africa. In wet-dry seasonal environments in tropical Africa, adults of Bicyclus butterflies are present all year round and exhibit discrete seasonal forms in alternating generations. We demonstrate that a population that colonized a more temperate climate region has adopted a different strategy to cope with the local environment. No active adults were encountered during the temperate winter. The flight season coincided with a period when evaporation stress was lowest and temperatures were higher in the South African population. Butterflies collected from the field did not express seasonal polyphenism or show full expression of the tropical wet season form phenotype. Reaction norm experiments comparing stocks from South Africa and Uganda indicated that local adaptation of this tropical butterfly to a more temperate climate involved changes in the degree of developmental plasticity, such that a more robust development in response to thermal variation was observed for a broad suite of morphological and life-history traits. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that facilitate expansion into a novel ecological niche in seasonally variable climatic conditions.

AB  - Purpose/Background: Strength asymmetries are related to knee injuries in intermittent sports players. The purpose of this study was to examine whether elite futsal players demonstrate strength asymmetries during knee isokinetic testing applying the Croisier et al. (21) criteria.
   Methods: Forty male elite (27.9 +/- 6.5 years) Brazilian futsal players participated in the study. The testing protocol required players to perform concentric contractions of both quadriceps and hamstring muscles at angular velocities of 60 degrees.s(-1) and 240 degrees.s(-1) and eccentric contractions of hamstring at 30 degrees.s(-1) and 120 degrees.s(-1). Conventional (concentric: concentric) and mixed (eccentric: concentric) hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratios were calculated. Subjects were determined to have an imbalanced strength profile if an athlete had at least two parameters that were asymmetrical across speeds and conditions. Asymmetry was operationally defined as peak torque asymmetry greater than 15% in bilateral comparison, and H/Q ratio less than 0.47 for conventional and 0.80 for mixed conditions.
   Results: Significant differences were observed between preferred and nonpreferred limbs in the concentric contractions of flexors at 240 degrees.s(-1) and eccentric contractions of extensors and flexors at 30 degrees.s(-1) and 120 degrees.s(-1). However, these asymmetries did not exceed 15%. The conventional and mixed H/Q ratios were greater in the preferred than in nonpreferred limbs, but only the mixed hamstrings(ecc)/quadriceps(conc) in the nonpreferred limbs showed values lower than recommended (< 0.80). In addition, 50% of elite futsal players had preseason strength imbalances per the developed criteria.
   Conclusion: The studied elite futsal players had preseason strength imbalances, which may increase the risk of hamstring injuries.

AB  - The Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) is effective for selective hamstring strengthening to improve muscle balance between knee flexors and extensors. The purpose of this study (within subject design of repeated measures) was to determine the effects of a standardized 4-week NHE training on thigh strength and muscle balance with concomitant kinetic and kinematic monitoring. Sixteen male sprinters (22years, 181cm, 76kg) performed a standardized 4-week NHE training consisting of three sessions per week (each 3x3 repetitions). Six rope-assisted and six unassisted sessions were performed targeting at a constant knee extension angular velocity of similar to 15 degrees/s across a similar to 90-100 degrees knee joint range of motion. Kinetic (peak and mean moment, impulse) and kinematic parameters (eg, ROM to downward acceleration, ROMDWA) were recorded during selected sessions. Unilateral isokinetic tests of concentric and eccentric knee flexors and extensors quantified muscle group-, contraction mode-, and velocity-specific training adaptations. Peak moments and contractional work demonstrated strong interactions of time with muscle group, contraction modes, and angular velocities ((2)>.150). NHE training increased eccentric hamstring strength by 6%-14% as well as thigh muscle balance with biggest adaptations at 150 degrees/s 2weeks after NHE training. Throughout the training period significant increases (P<.001) of peak ((2)=.828) and mean moments ((2)=.611) became apparent, whereas the impulse and the ROMDWA of unassisted NHE repetitions remained unchanged (P>.05). A 4-week NHE training significantly strengthened the hamstrings and improved muscle balance between knee flexors and extensors. Despite the slow training velocity, biggest adaptations emerged at the highest velocity 2weeks after training ended.

AB  - To examine whether adding preconditioning hamstring resistance exercises to a regular warmup prior to a repeated sprinting exercise provides protection against the sprinting-induced muscle damage. Ten female soccer players (mean +/- SD age: 21.3 +/- 4.5yrs; height: 171.34 +/- 8.29 cm; weight: 68.53 +/- 11.27 kg) participated in this study. After the familiarization visit, the subjects completed three separate randomly sequenced experimental visits, during which three different warm-up interventions were performed before the muscle-damaging protocol (12 sets of 30-m maximal repeated sprints): 1. Regular running and static stretching (Control); 2. Control with hyperextensions (HE); 3. Control with single leg Romanian deadlift (SLRD). Before (Pre), immediately (PostO), 24 hours (24hr), and 48 hours after (48hr) the sprints, hamstring muscle thickness, muscle stiffness, knee flexion eccentric peak torque, knee extension concentric peak torque, and functional hamstring to quadriceps ratios were measured. Repeated sprints have induced muscle damage (e.g., an average of 42% knee flexion eccentric strength reduction) in all three conditions. After the SLRD, hamstring muscle thickness decreased from 24hr to 48hr (p < 0.001). Additionally, muscle stiffness and eccentric strength for the SLRD showed no difference from baseline at 24hr and 48hr, respectively. When compared with the SLRD at 48hr, the muscle stiffness and the eccentric strength were greater and lower, respectively, in other protocols. The SLRD protocol had protective effect on sprinting-induced muscle damage markers than other protocols. Athletes whose competitions/training are densely scheduled may take advantage of this strategy to facilitate muscle recovery.

AB  - The acoustic characteristics of 2D single-oscillator, dual-oscillator, and triple-oscillator acoustic metamaterials were investigated based on concentric ring structures using the finite element method. For the single-oscillator, dual-oscillator, and triple-oscillator models investigated here, the dipolar resonances of the scatterer always induce negative effective mass density, preventing waves from propagating in the structure, thus forming the band gap. As the number of oscillators increases, relative movements between the oscillators generate coupling effect; this increases the number of dipolar resonance modes, causes negative effective mass density in more frequency ranges, and increases the number of band gaps. It can be seen that the number of oscillators in the cell is closely related to the number of band gaps due to the coupling effect, when the filling rate is of a certain value.

AB  - This paper presents an accurate approach for Concentric Circular Antenna Array (CCAA) synthesis to improve the far-field radiation characteristics of the antenna using a meta-heuristic optimization technique called Moth Flame Optimization (MFO). The far-field radiation pattern improves with lower Side Lobe Level (SLL) which is essential for the reduction of interference in the entire side lobe regions. MFO algorithm is a recently proposed evolutionary algorithm which is applied to determine the optimum sets of current excitation weights and to find the optimal inter-element spacing between the array elements in the 3-rings structure of CCAA design. In this context, the design examples of two 3-ring CCAAs, one having the set of 4, 6, 8 elements and the other having the set of 8, 10, 12 elements, with and without centre element, are presented by optimizing the array parameters. The results obtained by using MFO algorithm based approach show a considerable improvement of SLL with respect to that of the uniform array pattern and those of the approaches reported in the recent literature.

AB  - The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), located in central Mexico, saw completion of the final construction phase in 2017 with the installation of the full 50-meter primary reflector, following three years of operation as a 32-meter facility. The task was accomplished by adding two more concentric rings of surface segments to the existing three inner rings. Various techniques have been used previously to measure and align the 32-meter surface, including multiple laser trackers and far-field phased holography. Whilst the former method is time-consuming, requiring a full night to obtain a single surface map, holography provides low spatial resolution and requires removal of the secondary reflector for installation of the twin-horn receiver at the primary focus.
   Photogrammetry has been used as an alternative measurement technique for the 32-m primary since 2015(1), and has gradually replaced our use of holography and laser trackers for this task during recent years. Once the object has been targeted, photogrammetry maps may be obtained in around one hour. The technique does not require the installation of special equipment on the antenna, and has the advantage of allowing surface maps to be taken at any chosen elevation. The main drawbacks for the LMT application are environmental, since the antenna operates without an enclosure; strong winds may prevent use of the site tower crane for image taking, while the formation of condensation and frost on the reflector surface will "switch off" the reflective targets.
   In this paper we discuss comparative measurements taken as the first outer segments were installed, and the use of photogrammetry to carry out the alignment of the fully installed 50-meter surface. At the time of writing this activity is still in progress, however full-surface alignment to the order of just over 100 microns was achieved quite quickly, with multiple elevation maps allowing the development of a usable 50-m active surface model for compensation of gravitational distortions.

AB  - The understanding of the processes involved in soot formation and oxidation is a critical factor for a reliable prediction of emissions in aero-engines, particularly as legislation becomes increasingly stringent. This work studies the flame structure and soot formation in a lab-scale burner, which reproduces the main features of a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor; using high-fidelity numerical simulations. The investigated burner, developed at the University of Cambridge, is based on a bluff-body swirl-stabilised ethylene flame, with air provided in the primary region through two concentric swirling flows and quenching enabled by means of four dilution jets at variable distance downstream. Measurements for different air split between the two inlet swirling flows and dilution ports, and different height of the dilution jets, indicate noticeable differences in the soot tendency. Numerical simulations have been performed using Large-Eddy Simulation with the Conditional Moment Closure combustion model and a two-equation model for soot, allowing a detailed resolution of the mixing field and to directly take into account the effect of turbulent transport on the flame structure, which has been shown to have an important effect on the soot formation and evolution. The main objective of this work is to study the flow field and mixing characteristics in the burner's primary region, in order to improve the understanding of the mechanisms leading to the soot behaviour observed in the experiment at different operating conditions. Results show the key role of mixing in determining the level of soot in the burner; with the soot production mainly related to the extension of the flame zone characterized by a rich mixture, with pyrolysis products and soot precursors. The presence of additional dilution air seems to improve the oxidation and leads to a leaner mixture in the primary combustion region whereas the air added through the outer swirl stream seems to have less impact on the mixture formation in the primary region. Analysis of the solution in mixture fraction space shows the importance of residence time for the soot formation and highlights the existence of a range of values of mixture fraction, between 0.1 and 0.2, where the soot production terms are maximum. High residence times and local air-to-fuel ratio in the range of high soot production should be avoided to decrease the level of soot mass fraction in the burner.

AB  - This research presents a study of the behavior of built-up compressed steel members composed of concentric hot rolled circular hollow sections. The use of these members is an innovative solution of practical interest for situations in which a single member does not reach the required compressive strength. Some technically and economically viable design and fabrication solutions to built-up members composed of concentric hot rolled circular hollow sections are presented. For the validation of numerical results, models of singular hollow sections are made and compared to the EN 1993-1-1, and the results obtained with numerical models were satisfactory. The compression resistance of these numerical models differs less than 9% from the EN 1993-1-1 values. Once the numerical modeling was validated, the study of built-up members was made, considering the tubes always united at the extremities by end plates, and along the length by fixed interconnections or sliding interconnections or, furthermore, without interconnections. For these three different conditions, several numerical models using FEM via Abaqus software were simulated to obtain and compare the compression resistance. The results show that these built-up sections with fixed and sliding interconnections have very similar behavior to the results obtained with European Standard procedure, when considering equivalent areas and inertias for the built-up section. Also, it shows that this observation does not apply to the sections without interconnections. Comparative graphs of compression resistance curves were generated, as also some graphs that show the distribution of the compressive force between each member of the built-up section. Finally, a formulation for the design of built-up sections without interconnections along the tubes was proposed to avoid robust computational methods.

AB  - The current scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature-based watermarking method proposed by Kawamura and Uchida was evaluated using Information Hiding Criteria (IHC) ver. 5. The marked regions were selected around the SIFT feature points then normalized to a uniform size against scaling attack, and watermarks were embedded into these normalized regions. There are two problems with this method. One is that the marked regions are distorted by normalization. The other is that the feature points are not detectable due to embedding on the points. Therefore, we propose an improved version of this method to solve these problems. We introduce two improvements called as a gradual magnification factor for normalization and concentric square regions for marked regions. The proposed method was evaluated using IHC ver. 5, and the feature detection rate improved and the bit error rate decreased.

AB  - Starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin and deposited as granules of different sizes and shapes with semi-crystalline and amorphous concentric layers that show the maltese cross'. Starches from different sources show variable chemical composition as well as the structure of their components that are involved in thermal properties. Amylose, lipids, phosphorylated residues and long lateral chain amylopectin interact among them avoiding water uptake. In contrast, high amylopectin contents, especially with short lateral chains, allow hydration via hydrogen bonds to form gels with the tendency to retrogradation. Smaller starch granules have a larger superficial area, surface pores, and channels that enhance water uptake. High hydration increases the swelling, viscosity, and gelatinization ability of starch granules. The knowledge of those properties allows the selection of the most appropriate starch for a specific end use. This review discusses the relationship between the physicochemical composition of the starch and their rheological properties.

AB  - In Europe, concentrically braced frames (CBFs) with double angle bracings are the most frequent lateral-resistant structural systems. Although their standard bolted connections provide economic and robust solutions for the static loading, they are assumed to have almost zero ductility under strong earthquake actions. In order to avoid a brittle failure, the current seismic design requirements of European Code provisions require these joints to have sufficient over-strength, and to remain elastic for the design earthquake. While this is a safe approach for the high seismicity situations, it causes costly solutions for the buildings designed in the low-to-moderate seismicity context. Therefore, mainly for economy reasons, design engineers usually choose standard non-seismic approach (DCL) for the design of CBFs located in low-to-moderate seismic regions. However, such a choice may lead to unsafe solutions, since no effort is paid to control ductility. To combine safety and economy in this context, a new specific method has been studied in the recently concluded EU-RFCS MEAKADO project. To explore the inherent ductility provided by standard double-angle bracing joints with preloaded bolts and respecting new edge-spacing requirements, full scale tests have been performed as a project task. This article analyses the test results, and quantifies the ductility provided by the bolt hole ovalization and the slippage of preloaded bolts of the bracing joints not fulfilling the current over-strength design criteria. The test data has been analysed by means of LVDTs, strain gauges and thermal images. Such ductility and dissipation resources are traditionally not desired from a high seismicity design point of view, but may satisfy the low horizontal shear demand of the buildings designed for the low-to-moderate earthquake zones.

AB  - One of the major problems facing the development and road to practical usage of concentric tube continuum robots in surgical environments is that of instability. This issue, also known as the snapping problem, is caused by a tube having a high bending to torsional stiffness ratio (BTSR). Past efforts have shown that by cutting patterns on the tubes, this problem can be avoided. This paper seeks to redesign the topology of the tubes so that BTSR is decreased and the snapping problem is resolved in a particular tube set. The generated designs are then tested through finite element analysis as well as experimental testing to demonstrate the elimination of the snapping problem. Using this novel tube design on a concentric tube robotic system can increase its stable workspace because it allows the usage of greater tube curvatures and/or curve lengths.

AB  - The complex nature of air pollution in urban areas prevents traditional monitoring techniques from obtaining measurements representative of true human exposure. The current study assessed the capability of low-cost mobile monitors to acquire useful data in a city without a monitoring network in place (Lubbock, Texas) using a bicycle platform. The monitoring campaign resulted in 30 days of data along a 13.4km fixed concentric route. Due to high sensitivities to airflow, the apparent wind velocity was accounted for throughout the route. The data were also normalized into percentiles in order to visualize spatial patterns.The highest estimated pollution levels were located near frequently busy intersections and roads; however, sensor issues resulted in lower confidence. Additional research is needed concerning the appropriate use of low-cost metal oxide sensors for citizen science applications, as measurements can be misleading if the user is unaware of sensors specifications. The simultaneous use of several low-cost mobile platforms, rather than a single platform, as well as the use of high-end cases, are recommended to create a more robust spatial analysis. The issues addressed from this research are important to understand for accurate and beneficial application of low-cost gaseous monitors for citizen science.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of an eccentric-load training program based on squat exercises (1/2 squat and lateral squat) on the lower-body power of a football player during the rehabilitation process of a medial collateral ligament injury (MCL). Methods: During 4 weeks (3 sessions a week) the soccer player followed the eccentric-load training program proposed on both legs. Before, during, and after the intervention, lower-body power was evaluated bilaterally and unilaterally, and data was obtained on the mean power, peak power, work, and duration, in both concentric and eccentric phases. Results: Significant improvements (p d >>.05) in mean and maximal power (bilateral and unilateral) were obtained in both concentric and eccentric phases. Asymmetries related to power have also been reduced. Conclusions: the application of an eccentric-overload training program during the functional recovery process results in an increase in the lower-body power and reduces the asymmetry caused by a sports injury, which is reflected in the decrease in the recovery period.

AB  - In public communication networks such as the internet, users can easily share and access multimedia products such as images, videos, and audios. Copyright protection is a vital issue to prove the ownership of products in these networks. Consequently, digital watermarking that hide invisible watermark or logo plays a significant role in overcoming copyright issue. However, any person has access to multimedia products can simply use these products. Also, there are professional attackers can remove the watermark or logo without loss the visibility of the multimedia product and claim their ownership for the digital products. This study proposes an image watermarking model that only allows authorized users to use the watermarked image. This model is robust against crop and rotation attacks. It is based on the proposed embedding method that we named a "concentric rectangles", which embeds data in rectangles starting from the center toward outer boundary to overcome the crop and rotation attacks. The resulted watermarked image is distorted in such a way to be recognized by any user, but only the authorized one can obtain a high quality of the watermarked image. The experimental results of the proposed model show that the embedding capacity can reach up to 25% from the size of the host image with watermarked image quality above 40 dB in terms of peak signal to noise rotation (PSNR). Furthermore, the proposed model is fully retrieval for the watermark image (logo) and the logo still retrieved a with a recognized vision until 10 dB of signal to noise ratio of noise adding.

AB  - In complex low altitude airspace, some factors may cause that flight information cannot interact properly between UAVs. UAV cannot normally obtain flight information of others within its communication range. Therefore, we propose a distributed approach to multi-aircraft real-time conflict resolution. UAVs can enhance the ability of autonomous conflict resolution through the study of preorder flight information with the prerequisite for the unavailability of others' flight information. First, we obtain the payoff of safety and efficiency adopting speed and heading adjustments as maneuver strategy of collision avoidance. Then, according to the preorder flight information, UAV builds a memory pool which is learned by it to obtain the most rewarding collision avoidance strategy. Finally, the simulation results on the random flight scenario of two concentric circles show that our approach is promising in terms of safety and system efficiency.

AB  - In mining operations carried out below the water table, mine area could potentially affect the surrounding. With further deepening of the mine and quarry, the drawdown can impact on water supply wells and base flow. The variation in radius of influence under confined and unconfined aquifer condition is assessed using a hypothetical case study with three operational quarry sites. Average pit-wise radius of influence (R-0) for the pit mine, under unconfined and confined aquifer conditions is 963 m and 61 km, respectively, whereas effective radius (R-e) for total (cumulative) excavated mine area is 1.7 and 146 km. respectively. It means that the maximum and minimum value of overall impact/influence for the unconfined aquifer lies in-between 963 m and 1.7 km. Similarly that the maximum and minimum value of overall impact/influence for the confined aquifer lies in-between 61 and 146 km. Meanwhile, R-e or effective radius for total (cumulative) excavated area seems more appropriate from evaluation viewpoint due to the overlapping (superposition) concentric mining quarries. Thus, assessment of quarry-wise and total radius of influence is of importance to fulfil targeted production, economically with minimum interruptions as part of the mine planning. Moreover, it helps us to assess, monitor and regulate the impact of a mine-dewatering program in the area. Also, the pumping test is often used to estimate radius of influence; it can trigger the inflow or radius of influence. Estimate of the radius of influence using analytical equation mainly independent of discharge/abstraction from the aquifer stands as a preferred choice for the prediction of radius of influence at the quarry/mine pit. There is a strong rationale that policies should be infonned by such analytical assessment because it helps us to prevent or minimize negative impacts as part of regulation and pit-mining management and are useful tools for practitioners to design economically efficient and cost-effective in situ groundwater remediation systems, to contain contaminant plumes, to evaluate the surface-subsurface water interaction and to verify numerical models.

AB  - Despite the evolution of runner performance in athletes with cerebral palsy (CP), little is known about neuromuscular parameters of sprinters from different classes, especially related to power output, muscular imbalances and asymmetry indexes in lower limbs. The aim of this study was to assess muscle power, muscular imbalance and asymmetry in sprinters with CP. Four male sprinters with CP (age, 18 to 27 years; body mass, 58.5 to 72.8 kg; height, 161.5 to 174 cm) classified as T38, T37, T36, T35 according to International Paralympic Committee functional classification, performed vertical counter movement jump and squat jump on force plate and isokinetic torque evaluations in both limbs. The concentric peak torque (PT) was measured at 60 degrees/sec, 120 degrees/sec and 180 degrees/sec and PT eccentric at 60 degrees/sec and 120 degrees/sec. The asymmetry indexes, conventional and functional ratios were assessed. the results showed that athletes with more severe impairments (T35 and T36) showed worse performance to muscle power, more muscular imbalance and higher asymmetry in PT between limbs (> 10%). The exception was T37 athlete, who presented the better performance for all variables. it is concluded that CP athletes with more severe impairments showed lower jumping performance and torque production of knee extensors and flexors, they showed greater asymmetries between limbs. Finally, considering the results of T37 athlete, it seems that the athletic training for a longer period can reverse part of the neuromuscular impairments caused by CP.

AB  - The attraction range of olfactory response by winged female gynoparae (autumn migrants that give birth to oviparae, the sexual females) and male damson-hop aphids Phorodon humuli (Schrank) is investigated in field experiments over 2years by analyzing the spatial patterns of catches in concentric circles of yellow-painted traps (60 in total) around a central trap releasing the species' sex pheromone, (1RS,7S,7aS)-nepetalactol. Males are more likely than females to be found in the central trap, with 65.6% of the 1824 males caught there compared with 11.2% of 1346 females. Both morphs are more numerous in traps axial with the mean wind direction and centred on the pheromone-release trap than at other angles. Males are approximately five-fold more numerous in traps downwind than at similar distances upwind of the pheromone, showing that its presence stimulates landing. For males, the estimated active space of the lure extends 6m downwind. Catches of females are equally numerous up and downwind of the pheromone lure because females orienting on the axis of the pheromone source continue to respond to visual cues in their flight path if they overshoot the olfactory one. For females, the active space of a pheromone lure is less than 2m downwind. It is unimportant for either morph whether the pheromone-release trap is yellow or transparent. In these experiments, both morphs orient with, track and probably arrive in the pheromone source trap from at least 26m, the distance to the nearest aphid-infested hops.

AB  - Background: Anterior cruciate ligament injury is higher in soccer athletes as compared to athletes of other sports. Risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament injury include low knee hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio and bilateral strength deficits.
   Purpose: To investigate isokinetic thigh muscles strength, hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio, and bilateral strength comparisons in athletes who participate in professional soccer, futsal, and beach soccer.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Brazilian professional soccer (n = 70), futsal (n = 30), and beach soccer (n = 12) players were isokinetically assessed to examine strength of knee extensors and flexors at 60 degrees/second in concentric mode, to measure peak torque of dominant and non-dominant limbs.
   Results: In the dominant limb, for extensors muscles, futsal players presented significantly lower peak torque values (223.9 +/- 33.4 Nm) than soccer (250.9 +/- 43.0 Nm; p = 0.02) and beach soccer players (253.1 +/- 32.4 Nm; p = 0.03). Peak torque for extensor muscles in the non-dominant limb was significantly lower in futsal (224.0 +/- 35.8 Nm) than in beach soccer players (256.8 +/- 39.8 Nm; p = 0.03). Hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio for dominant limbs for futsal (57.6 +/- 10.1%), soccer (53.5 +/- 8.8%), and beach soccer (56.3 +/- 8.4%) players presented no significant differences between groups; however, the mean values were lower than recommended values found in the literature. There were no strength deficits for any of the evaluated groups when compared bilaterally.
   Conclusions: Futsal athletes presented lower values for quadriceps strength than soccer and beach soccer athletes. Futsal, soccer, and beach soccer players presented no strength asymmetries, but they presented with strength imbalance in hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio.

AB  - Typhoons with long-lived concentric eyewalls (CEs) are more intense than those with short-lived CEs. It is important for more accurate prediction of typhoon intensity to understand the maintenance mechanism of the long-lived CEs. To study the mechanism of the long-term maintenance of CEs, a numerical experiment of Typhoon Bolaven (2012) is performed using a nonhydrostatic model with full physics. Two aspects of the maintenance of simulated CEs are investigated: the maintenance of the inner eyewall and the contraction of the outer eyewall. To examine the maintenance of the inner eyewall, the equivalent potential temperature budget and air parcel trajectories of the simulated inner eyewall are calculated. The results show that the entropy supply to the inner eyewall is sufficient to maintain the inner eyewall after secondary eyewall formation (SEF). During the early period after SEF, entropy is supplied by an axisymmetric inflow, and later it is supplied by nonaxisymmetric flows of the outer eyewall. To examine the contraction of the outer eyewall, the potential vorticity (PV) budget of the outer eyewall is diagnosed. The result reveals that the negative contribution to the contraction of the outer PV peak (i.e., the outer eyewall) in the early period is the negative PV generation due to axisymmetric advection and diabatic heating just inside of the outer PV peak. In the later period, the negative PV generation due to nonaxisymmetric structure is important for the prevention of contraction. The present study reveals that the structure of the outer eyewall plays important roles in the maintenance of long-lived CEs.

AB  - The presence of rocks in the ejecta of craters at the InSight landing site in southwestern Elysium Planitia indicates a strong, rock-producing unit at depth. A finer regolith above is inferred by the lack of rocks in the ejecta of 10-m-scale craters. This regolith should be penetrable by the mole of the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3). An analysis of the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of 7988 rocky ejecta craters (RECs) across four candidate landing ellipses reveals that all craters > 200 m in diameter and < 750 +/- 30 Ma in age have boulder-sized rocks in their ejecta. The frequency of RECs however decreases significantly below this diameter (D), represented by a roll-off in the SFD slope. At 30 m< D< 200 m, the slope of the cumulative SFD declines to near zero at D< 30 m. Surface modification, resolution limits, or human counting error cannot account for the magnitude of this roll-off. Rather, a significant population of < 200 m diameter fresh non-rocky ejecta craters (NRECs) here indicates the presence of a relatively fine-grained regolith that prevents smaller craters from excavating the strong rock-producing unit. Depth to excavation relationships and the REC size thresholds indicate the region is capped by a regolith that is almost everywhere 3 m thick but may be as thick as 12 to 18 m. The lower bound of the thickness range is independently confirmed by the depth to the inner crater in concentric or nested craters. The data indicate that 85% of the InSight landing region is covered by a regolith that is at least 3 m thick. The probability of encountering rockier material at depths > 3 m by the HP3 however increases significantly due to the increase in boulder-size rocks in the lower regolith column, near the interface of the bedrock.

AB  - Steel concentrically-braced frames (CBFs) as seismic lateral force resisting systems have been widely used in seismic regions. The incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is adopted to construct the collapse ductility spectrum for the CBF considering the P-Delta effect and sudden loss in strength and stiffness, which is physically more meaningful than existing baseline criteria. The design performance plot is constructed by newly combining the collapse ductility spectrum with ductility demand spectrum on the same figure, from which the threshold period and design ductility region for the frame are determined. A parametric study is conducted for the CBF over the full range of periods and parameters. The results show that the reserve capacity of the CBF contributes appreciably to collapse prevention, and the presented approach is more suitable for assessing the collapse of CBFs with dynamic instability. For moderate seismic regions, the threshold periods of the CBF determined by both the collapse ductility spectrum and existing baseline criteria are quite close. However, for high seismic regions, using the global drift angle limit may yield non-conservative results, since it fails to address the dynamic instability of CBFs with short periods.

TI  - Seismic Rehabilitation of Concentrically Braced Frames Using Stiff Rocking Cores
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Existing steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings subjected to seismic hazards can exhibit an undesirable soft-story response, in which drift and damage are concentrated in a single story, whereas other stories remain relatively undamaged. This paper investigates the fundamental behavior and proposes a rehabilitative design procedure that uses a stiff rocking core (SRC) to redistribute lateral demands, thereby preventing soft-story response. The technique is relatively nonintrusive compared to traditional rehabilitative measures and can satisfy a maximum specified story drift for a given hazard level. Representative low-rise and midrise prototype CBFs are used to illustrate the fundamental mechanical and dynamic behavior of the SRC in support of the proposed rehabilitation design procedure. Results from nonlinear transient seismic analysis of both existing and SRC-rehabilitated CBFs are used to evaluate the SRC's ability to improve the seismic performance of existing CBF structures. These results indicate that the SRC can be designed to prevent soft-story formation and, at the same time, achieve a target maximum interstory drift for a given seismic hazard.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Assessment of the differences in isokinetic concentric strength of the knee extensors and flexors in soccer players measured before the end of the season (April) in the years 2013 and 2014. METHOD Measurements were made in the April of 2013 and 2014 in 13 professional soccer players of hamstring (H) and quadriceps (Q) peak torque-ratio (PT), and total work (TW) at two testing speeds (60 degrees.s(-1) and 180 degrees.s(-1)), expressed as per-kg body weight (Nm center dot kg(-1)), and peak muscle torque (PT) (Nm), using an IsoMed 2000-dynamometer chair. Repeated measures analysis (based on general linear modeling) was used to assess the differences. RESULTS Between 2013 and 2014 a positive.-change was observed in mean match playing time (+35%, p=0.001), but less time had been spent during training sessions on isokinetic strength training. Correlation analysis according to the different velocities showed significantly negative correlation in 2013 between the playing time and TWQ at 60 degrees.s(-1) and at 180 degrees.s(-1) between TWQ and age (p<0.05). PT was lower for the players in 2014 than in 2013 at 60 degrees.s(-1): Q (Nm)-(-32.0, p=0.002) v 60 degrees.s(-1) Q (Nm kg(-1))-(-0.40, p=0.002), as was the percentage of ratio (%)-(-13.1, p<0.001) and TWH (-93, p=0.043). In 2014, positive correlation was found of 60 degrees.s(-1) PTH (Nm), 60 degrees.s(-1) PTH (Nm.kg) and 180 degrees.s(-1) PTQ (Nm) measurements with the playing-time (p<0.05). In 2014 Angular velocity of 180 degrees.s(-1) PT was lower in 2014 at H-(Nm) (-9.8, p=0.008), ratio (%) (-21.1, p<0.001) and in TWH (-144, p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS The limited time spent on individual training sessions in the second year of testing, because of higher mean match-play time and the optional nature of the isokinetic concentric strength training, appeared to affect negatively the maximum torque of the knee and thus increase the risk for severe injuries.

AB  - A climate-related shift in the range boundaries of the western-central Eurasian subboreal species Melanargia russiae in the Ural region from the northern forest-steppe zone to pine-birch forests was found. Morphological variation of M. russiae wings from the boundary northern populations and populations from the main part of the range in the Urals were studied. The results of a complex analysis of the morphological traits (size, wing shape, and wing pattern eyespots) confirm the hypothesis that the local population formed in the south of Sverdlovsk oblast and contradict the hypothesis of the migratory origin of M. russiae imago.

AB  - Bacterial sporulation allows starving cells to differentiate into metabolically dormant spores that can survive extreme conditions. Following asymmetric division, the mother cell engulfs the fore-spore, surrounding it with two bilayer membranes. During the engulfment process, an essential channel, the so-called feeding tube apparatus, is thought to cross both membranes to create a direct conduit between the mother cell and the forespore. At least nine proteins are required to create this channel, including SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAA-AH. Here, we present the near-atomic resolution structure of one of these proteins, SpoIIIAG, determined by single-particle cryo-EM. A 3D reconstruction revealed that SpoIIIAG assembles into a large and stable 30-fold symmetric complex with a unique mushroom-like architecture. The complex is collectively composed of three distinctive circular structures: a 60-stranded vertical beta-barrel that forms a large inner channel encircled by two concentric rings, one beta-mediated and the other formed by repeats of a ring-building motif (RBM) common to the architecture of various dual membrane secretion systems of distinct function. Our near-atomic resolution structure clearly shows that SpoIIIAG exhibits a unique and dramatic adaptation of the RBM fold with a unique beta-triangle insertion that assembles into the prominent channel, the dimensions of which suggest the potential passage of large macromolecules between the mother cell and forespore during the feeding process. Indeed, mutation of residues located at key interfaces between monomers of this RBM resulted in severe defects both in vivo and in vitro, providing additional support for this unprecedented structure.

AB  - Stone fruit is cooled after harvesting to extend its shelf life and prevent postharvest losses. Because it is quickly subject to chilling injuries at inappropriate temperatures, its thermal properties should be known in order to design an optimum cooling process. However, how long does it take for an olive to reach its storage temperature at the stone-pulp interface? This paper proposes approximated equations as a model for predicting cooling times at the stone-pulp interface and for measuring the thermal diffusivity of the pulp and the external heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on a solution in Fourier series for the conduction of heat in spheres with an inner concentric, insulating spherical core, as a model of conduction of heat in stone fruits.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare isokinetic strength performance profiles in elite soccer players across different field positions. A total of 111 elite international players of Polish Ekstraklasa (the top division in Poland) were examined during the 2010-2015 seasons. The players were classified into six positional roles: central defenders (CD), external defenders (ED), central midfielders (CM), external midfielders (EM), forwards (F), and goalkeepers (G). The concentric isokinetic strength (peak torque [PT] of quadriceps and hamstrings, H/Q ratios) was calculated for the dominant leg and the non-dominant leg at angular velocity of 1.05 rad.s(-1), whereas to assess isokinetic muscle endurance, the total work [TW] at angular velocity of 4.19 rad.s(-1), was taken into consideration. The results showed that isokinetic strength performance varies significantly among players in different playing positions. The analysis of PT for quadriceps (PT-Q) and hamstrings (PT-H) generally showed that the goalkeepers and central midfielders had lower strength levels compared to other playing positions. In the case of PT-H and hamstring/quadricep (H/Q) peak torque ratios, statistically significant differences were also noted for the legs, where mean values noted for the dominant leg were higher than for the non-dominant leg. For TW for quadriceps (TW-Q) and hamstrings (TW-H), statistically significant differences were noted only between playing positions. TW-Q values for goalkeepers were lower than for central defenders and external midfielders. TW-H values for goalkeepers were lower than for central midfielders, central defenders and external midfielders. This study showed that specific functional activity of players in individual positions on the field influences the varied profile of isokinetic strength performance.

AB  - Male investment towards reproduction is substantial in some species, and this leads to the evolution of choosy males. Male choice is often directed towards female phenotypes that are good indicators of fecundity such as body size, age, or virgin status, and often acts in the same direction as fecundity selection. In insects, only a few examples exist where male choice is directed towards female ornaments as proxies Butler of female quality. Here, we use dry season males of the sex-role reversed butterfly species Bicyclus anynana to test for differences in male choosiness and investment towards females of varying attractiveness using ornament-manipulations. Male reproductive investment in this species is in the form of a nuptial gift, a spermatophore, given to females upon mating. Males were placed in cages with either wild-type ornamented females or with nonornamented females (center of the dorsal forewing eyespots painted over), and time to mating, duration of mating, and longevity of males and females after a single mating were measured. Ornament manipulations consisted of blocking the UV-reflective scales in the center of the dorsal forewing eyespots of females, a known sexual ornament. Males displayed lower latency to mate and longer mating durations with ornamented females. The longer mating duration did not, however, translate in the transfer of a nuptial gift that increased female longevity or reduced male longevity. Instead, we propose that longer mating durations with ornamented females may represent increased mate guarding behavior or increased sperm transfer.

AB  - To investigate the effect of within match fatigue on knee kinematics and jump kinetics in girls' soccer players, a quasi-experiment time series design was employed collecting data before, after and at 15-min intervals during a 90-min simulated soccer match. 15 girl players (age 13.1 +/- 1.4 years) performed a counter movement jump and a single-leg drop jump. Mean concentric force and flight time to contraction time ratio were derived from the counter movement jump. Knee valgus and flexion angles were calculated during the single-leg drop from 3-dimensional motion capture. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and readiness were collected at each time series. Small to large increases in RPE and reductions in readiness were observed throughout the match from baseline. Moderate to large improvements in mean concentric force were shown at 15, 75 and 90-min when compared to baseline. Flight time to contraction time ratio increased moderately at 15 min. Changes in kinematics were typically trivial or unclear however, small increases in knee valgus were shown after 30 min compared to baseline. Subjective measures may provide useful information to understand the physical response of young players to match play.

AB  - A TheRmophoretic Annular Precipitator (TRAP) aimed to study the thermophoresis of soot particles is presented in this paper. This device consists of two 0.5 m length concentric tubes together with an inner cylinder and an external envelope. The particles flow through the 1 mm gap created between the inner and outer tubes with imposed temperatures, the inner tube is cooled and the outer one is heated. A thermal gradient is thus created, and particles will deposit by thermophoresis on the inner tube cold wall. This device is based on the so-called penetration method, where the deposition rate on the cold wall is obtained by particles concentration measurements upstream and downstream of the test section. A model developed in this study allowed the conversion of the deposition rates into thermophoretic diffusion coefficients Kth. In this work, the thermophoretic diffusion coefficient in a vertical laminar flow were measured for mono-dispersed spherical PSL particles with particles diameter ranging from 0.1 to 1 mu m, and also for poly-dispersed DEP droplets oil with particles diameter from 0.1 to 0.65 mu m. The Reynolds number and the thermal gradient values were fixed respectively at 520 and 60,000 K m(-1) in order to avoid convective effects that might appear in a laminar configuration. The thermophoretic diffusion coefficients were compared to the theoretical models and other experimental data from the literature. The good agreement found especially with Beresnev and Chernyak (1995) model together with the experimental data validates the use of the TRAP to the on-line determination of the soot particles thermophoretic diffusion coefficients.

AB  - The marine dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium possesses an ocelloid, the most elaborate photoreceptor organelle known in a unicellular organism, and a piston, a fast contractile appendage unknown in any other organism. The ocelloid is able to rotate, often before the cell swims. The ocelloid contains lenses that function to concentrate light. The flagellar propulsion is atrophied, and the piston is responsible for locomotion through successive extensions and contractions. During the locomotion mode, the contraction is similar to 4 times faster than the extension. The piston attained up to and the cell jumps backwards at while during the piston extension the cell moves forwards. The net speed of is faster than other dinoflagellates. The piston usually moved in the static mode without significant cell swimming. This study suggests that the piston is also a tactile organelle that scans the surrounding waters for prey. Erythropsidinium feeds on copepod eggs by engulfing. The end of the piston possesses a suction cup able to attach the prey and place it into the posterior cavity for engulfing. The cylindrical shape of Erythropsidinium, and the anterior position of the ocelloid and nucleus, are morphological adaptations that leave space for the large vacuole. Observations are provided on morphological development during cell division. Most of the described species of Erythropsidinium apparently correspond to distinct life stages of known species, and the genus Greuetodinium (=Leucopsis) corresponds to an earlier division stage.

AB  - Core muscle imbalances and weak trunk strength are relevant for injury prevention and performance. Information regarding core strength requirements and ideal flexion/extension ratios in alpine skiing is limited. We aimed to compare trunk strength capacities in elite alpine skiers with those of a matched control group. The concentric maximal trunk flexion and extension of 109 elite skiers and 47 active controls were measured at 150 degrees/s in a ballistic mode using the CON-TREX (R) TP 1000 test system. The relative flexion peak torque was higher in male ski racers (p = 0.003; 2.44 +/- 0.30 Nm/kg) than in the controls (2.32 +/- 0.42 Nm/kg). The relative peak torque for extension was 4.53 +/- 0.65 Nm/kg in ski racers and 4.11 +/- 0.52 Nm/kg in the controls (p = 0.001). Female athletes were significantly stronger in both, relative flexion force (p = 0.006; skiers 2.05 +/- 0.22 Nm/kg; controls 1.74 +/- 0.28 Nm/kg) and relative extension force (p = 0.001; skiers 3.55 +/- 0.53 Nm/kg; controls 3.14 +/- 0.48 Nm/kg). No significant differences were found in the ratios of flexion to extension forces in females and males. Ski racers are engaged in extensive strength training for both leg and trunk muscles, which explains the higher peak values. Both groups indicated a low ratio from 0.54-0.59, which represents high trunk extensor muscles strength relative to flexor muscles.

AB  - Dual-concentric core photonic crystal fibers (DCC-PCF) were a kind of dispersion compensating fiber with ultrahigh negative dispersion. However, they usually have an undesirable characteristic, called "modal squeeze" in this letter, which causes difficulty in achieving a single-mode operation. This letter discusses a phenomenon of modal squeeze, and proposes a solution to avoid it. Finally, we give designing examples of DCC-PCFs for avoiding the modal squeeze and operating in single mode.

AB  - Background/Objective: Evaluating hamstring strength by isokinetic dynamometry is limited by various practical issues such as time and cost. A video-based Nordic hamstring exercise is introduced as an alternative option. The aims of this study are to evaluate 1.) the between-session reliability and 2.) concurrent validity of the testing method compared to a standardized isokinetic dynamometry.
   Methods: Thirty male elite footballers were recruited for the study. From the Nordic hamstring exercise, the video-analysis-determined Nordic break-point angles where the participant could no longer withstand the force of the fall (eccentric mode) and the number of seconds that the player could hold at 30 degrees forward flexion angle (isometric mode) were measured. Intra-class correlation coefficients for between-session reliability, Pearson r correlations between the current method and isokinetic dynamometry were calculated.
   Results: The reliability of the eccentric mode was moderate (ICC ((2,1)) = 0.82) while that of isometric mode was poor (ICC ((2,1)) = 0.57). The Nordic break-point angle of the eccentric mode significantly correlated with the concentric and eccentric hamstring peak torque (r = 0.48 and 0.58, p < 0.001), while the isometric was not (r = 0.02 - 0.07, p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The eccentric mode of the video-based hamstring strength test was a moderately reliable and valid method to measure the eccentric hamstring strength in elite football players.

AB  - In this study, we explore the low-temperature thresholds of a pest of apple (Malus pumila Miller; Rosaceae), the eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana Denis and Schiffermuller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in the context of spring frost. Spilonota ocellana overwinters as a larva, resuming activity and feeding early in the growing season when it could be vulnerable to unexpected freezing temperatures. We determined that the mean supercooling point of spring instars did not differ for larvae within or outside leaf shelters and ranged from -9.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C for fourth instars, to -7.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C for sixth instars. Larval weight increased with instar and was positively related to the supercooling point. As some insects are freeze tolerant and able to recover from freezing, we also exposed larvae to brief freeze events between -4.5 degrees C and -9.5 degrees C and found that the median lower lethal temperature, was -7.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C across all instars; indicating that S. ocellana spring instars are susceptible to freezing temperatures above their supercooling point. These low-temperature thresholds suggest that in the spring, S. ocellana larvae are chill susceptible, and a hard frost (<-7 degrees C) would be necessary to cause significant larval mortality.

AB  - A global quench is an interesting setting where we can study thermalization of subsystems in a pure state. We investigate entanglement entropy (EE) growth in global quenches in holographic field theorios and relate some of its aspects to quantities characterizing chaos. More specifically we obtain four key results:
   1. We prove holographic bounds on the entanglement velocity v(E) and the butterfly effect speed v(B) that arises in the study of chaos.
   2. We obtain the EE as a function of time for large spherical entangling surfaces analytically. We show that the EE us insensitive to the details of the initial state or quench protocol.
   3. In a thermofield double state we determine analytically the two-sided mutual information between two large concentric spheres separated in time.
   4. We derive a bound on the rate of growth of EE for arbitrary shapes, and develop an expansion for EE at early times.
   In a companion paper [1], these results are put in the broader context of EE growth in chaotic systems: we relate EE growth to the chaotic spreading of operators, derive bounds on EE at a given time, and compare tin holographic results to spin chain numerics and toy models. In this paper, we perform holographic calculation that provide the basis of arguments presented in that paper.

AB  - BAKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine how hip, knee and ankle kinetics and kinematics influence effective impulse production during countermovement jumps.
   METHODS: Eighteen semi-professional soccer players (22.8 +/- 2.2 years) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants completed three maximal countermovement jumps on two force platforms (1000 Hz) that were linked to a nine camera infrared motion capture system (500 Hz).
   RESULTS: Kinetic and kinematic data revealed jumpers who fail to achieve uniform ground reaction force curves that result in optimal impulse production during their jump always display hip adduction and or hip internal rotation during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump. The variation of hip adduction and or internal rotation likely represents failed joint transition during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump and appears to account for a non-uniform force trace seen in these jumpers.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest rehabilitation and conditioning exercises for injury prevention and performance may benefit from targeting frontal and transverse plane movement.

AB  - European seismic design codes do not take into account the strength and stiffness of the secondary frame action provided by bracing gusset plates of concentrically braced frames (CBFs). This is an attractive assumption for practicing engineers, as it provides simplifications during the analysis and design phases. However, when efficiency and economy are concerned, especially in low-to-moderate seismic regions, this normally neglected frame resource may be interesting to consider in design. Gusset plates can provide a certain degree of stiffness and strength following the bracing failure, and may even prevent global collapse. In particular, when the shear deformation demand of the braced cell remains limited, as in the case of low-to-moderate seismic actions, it may become reasonable to take this extra stiffness and strength into account. Ongoing research project RFSR-CT-2013-00022 MEAKADO investigated this phenomenon by means of experimental and numerical studies with the perspective of setting new inputs for the design rules of the future generation of Eurocodes. This paper presents the results of full scale tests performed inside this research project, which characterized resistance, stiffness, and ductility resources of CBF systems designed for moderate seismicity. The paper also quantifies the effective contribution of the frame action, provided by gusset plate connections, to the global performance of CBF frames.

TI  - A compact multi-wire-layered secondary winding for Tesla transformer
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA  - English
KW  - BREAKDOWN
KW  - VOLTAGE
AB  - A compact multi-wire-layered (MWL) secondary winding for a Tesla transformer is put forward. The basic principle of this winding is to wind the metal wire on a polymeric base tube in a multi-layer manner. The tube is tapered and has high electrical strength and high mechanical strength. Concentric-circle grooves perpendicular to the axis of the tube are carved on the surface of the tube to wind the wire. The width of the groove is basically equal to the diameter of the wire so that the metal wire can be fixed in the groove without glue. The depth of the groove is n times of the diameter of the wire to realize the n-layer winding manner. All the concentric-circle grooves are connected via a spiral groove on the surface of the tube to let the wire go through. Compared with the traditional one-wire-layered (OWL) secondary winding for the Tesla transformer, the most conspicuous advantage of the MWL secondary winding is that the latter is compact with only a length of 2/n of the OWL. In addition, the MWL winding has the following advantages: high electrical strength since voids are precluded from the surface of the winding, high mechanical strength because polymer is used as the material of the base tube, and reliable fixation in the Tesla transformer as special mechanical connections are designed. A 2000-turn MWL secondary winding is fabricated with a winding layer of 3 and a total length of 1.0 m. Experiments to test the performance of this winding on a Tesla-type pulse generator are conducted. The results show that this winding can boost the voltage to 1 MV at a repetition rate of 50 Hz reliably for a lifetime longer than 104 pulses, which proves the feasibility of the MWL secondary winding.

AB  - We investigated the influence of shortening speed on concentric force potentiation at different frequencies in muscles devoid of skeletal myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK(-/-)) and unable to phosphorylate myosin. EDL muscles from skMLCK(-/-) mice were activated in vitro (25 A degrees C) across a range of stimulation frequencies (10-100 Hz) during shortening ramps at 0.10, 0.30, or 0.50 of maximum shortening velocity (V-max) before and after a potentiating stimulus (PS). When collapsed across all frequencies, the PS increased relative (post/pre) concentric force to 1.27 +/- 0.02 and 1.17 +/- 0.02 of pre-PS values at 0.50 and 0.30 V-max, respectively (n = 4, P < 0.05 for all speeds). In addition, potentiation was significantly greater at low and intermediate-than at high stimulus frequencies at both speeds. In contrast, during shortening at 0.10 V-max, a posttetanic depression was observed as mean concentric forces were reduced to 0.85 +/- 0.02 of pre-PS values. Thus, although reduced compared to published values for wildtype muscles (Gittings et al., J Muscle Res Cell Motil 33:359-368, 2012), skMLCK(-/-) muscles displayed a speed dependent potentiation of concentric force during moderate and fast shortening speed at all frequencies tested. Our data support the presence of a myosin phosphorylation-independent mechanism(s) for concentric force potentiation at moderate speeds of shortening, and also suggests that myosin phosphorylation may be necessary to prevent the concentric force depression that may be present at slow speeds of shortening. Although additive in nature, further work is needed to parse out the relative influence of myosin phosphorylation-independent and dependent potentiation mechanisms on wildtype contractile function during dynamic conditions.

AB  - This paper presents two analysis methods for the in-plane seismic response of steel multitiered braced frames (MT-BFs) with three or more tiers: (1)a substructuring technique; and (2)a stiffness analysis method. Both methods are consistent with the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions and have been developed to estimate column flexural demands and tier drifts to prevent column instability and to mitigate concentration of tier drifts as well as premature brace failure under seismic loading. Both methods account for the progression of brace tension yielding along the frame height as observed in MT-BFs. The substructuring technique is simpler and is limited to regular frames, as it assumes a predefined yielding sequence. The stiffness analysis-based method is more rigorous and can predict the actual frame nonlinear response. It can be applied to both regular and irregular MT-BF configurations. The application of the methods is illustrated for two five-tiered special concentrically braced frame examples. Nonlinear response history analysis is performed to validate the proposed methods for the frames studied. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - To examine and compare sex-related differences in the functioning of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles and the isokinetic hamstrings eccentric-to-quadriceps concentric functional ratio (H/Q (FUNC)).
   Fifty male and 46 female young adults completed this study. Each participant carried out an isokinetic assessment to determine isokinetic concentric and eccentric torques during knee extension and flexion actions at 3 different angular velocities (60, 180 and 300A degrees/s) adopting a lying position. The H/Q (FUNC) was calculated using peak torque (PT) values and 3 different joint-angle-specific torque values (15A degrees, 30A degrees and 45A degrees of knee extension). A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the results, and post hoc analyses using Friedman correction were employed.
   There were statistically significant effects of angular velocity, joint angle and sex on the H/Q (FUNC) (p < 0.01). Thus, the H/Q (FUNC) ratio in both males and females decreases closer to full knee extension and with increasing movement velocity. The H/Q (FUNC) was also significantly lower in females compared to males, irrespective of moment velocity and joint angle.
   The findings of the current study reinforce the need to examine the H/Q (FUNC) ratio closer to full knee extension (where knee injury is most likely to occur) rather than using PT values which may not be as informative, as well as to focus preventive and rehabilitation training programmes on reducing quadriceps dominance by enhancing eccentric hamstring strength (especially in females who are at higher risk of injury).

AB  - The traditional 2D MUSIC algorithm fixes the azimuth or the elevation, and searches for the other without considering the directions of sources. A spectrum peak diffusion effect phenomenon is observed and may be utilized to detect the approximate directions of sources. Accordingly, a fast 2D MUSIC algorithm, which performs azimuth and elevation simultaneous searches (henceforth referred to as AESS) based on only three rounds of search is proposed. Firstly, AESS searches along a circle to detect the approximate source directions. Then, a subsequent search is launched along several straight lines based on these approximate directions. Finally, the 2D Direction of Arrival (DOA) of each source is derived by searching on several small concentric circles. Unlike the 2D MUSIC algorithm, AESS does not fix any azimuth and elevation parameters. Instead, the adjacent point of each search possesses different azimuth and elevation, i.e., azimuth and elevation are simultaneously searched to ensure that the search path is minimized, and hence the total spectral search over the angular field of view is avoided. Simulation results demonstrate the performance characters of the proposed AESS over some existing algorithms.

AB  - Four different processes of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) combined with rejuvenation heat treatments (RHT) were adopted to reveal the microstructural evolution of creep damaged DZ125 specimens, finally the mechanical properties were evaluated. The results show that both gamma' precipitate degeneration and creep cavities for the creep damaged DZ125 superalloy are found after the pre-endurance damage test. However, the carbided compositions from MC type to M-23 C-6 type or M-6 C type has not been observed for DZ125. In addition, it is found that the HIP temperature play a dominant role in the cavity healing process for the damaged specimens. The concentrically oriented gamma' rafting structure and the incipient melting are observed at 1200 degrees C and 1250 degrees C respectively. Meanwhile, it is found that the appropriate HIP schedule adopted can effectively avoid the internal recrystallization for the directionally solidified nickel-based superalloy DZ125. The appropriate HIP schedule combined with RHT process can successfully restore the microstructure induced by creep damage and recover the degraded micro-hardness to the original one, in addition improve the creep rupture life.

AB  - Physical exercise can induce brain plasticity and reduce the cognitive decline observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We investigated the effects of physical exercise to prevent or reverse spatial memory deficits produced by diabetes and some biochemical and immunohistochemical changes in hippocampal astrocytes of T1DM model. In this study, 56 male Wistar rats were divided in four groups: trained control (TC), non-trained control (NTC), trained diabetic (TD) and non-trained diabetic (NTD). 27 days after streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes, the exercise groups were submitted to 5 weeks of aerobic exercise. All groups were assessed in place recognition (PR) test before and after training. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes were evaluated using planar morphology, optical densitometty and Sholl's concentric circles method. Glucose and glutamate uptake, reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutamine synthetase (GS) levels were measured using biochemical assays. Our main results are: 1-Exercise reverses spatial memory impairments generated by T1DM; 2-Exercise increases GSH and GS in TC but not in TD rats; 3-Exercise increases density of GFAP positive astrocytes in the TC and TD groups and increases astrocytic ramification in TD animals. Our findings indicate that physical exercise reverses the cognitive deficits present in T1DM and induces important biochemical and immunohistochemical astrocytic changes.

AB  - Progressive collapse is a phenomenon that can happen as a consequence of natural and artificial dangers. In progressive collapse mechanism, a local damage (such as removing a column) leads to a comprehensive and significant damage, which results in structure collapse. Research studies on progressive collapse of structures usually focus on gravitational and explosive loadings, in which the design goal is to increase structure robustness in order to prevent progressive collapse. During an earthquake, redistribution of the load borne by structural damaged members to the adjacent ones might lead to excessive tension or exceed resistant capacity of other members' load, which is the result of damage expansion and dispersion. In order to study progressive collapse of structures during earthquakes, three steel moment frame buildings with CBF, EBF and BRB have been selected, which have similar plans along with 8 stories, while lacking some structural members. In the above mentioned buildings, some braces have been removed, so that the influence of such scenarios on the structure's dynamic behavior during the earthquake could be studied. In this research, the buildings' potential and capacity for seismic progressive collapse as well as their damage modes were determined via Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Therefore, analysis can find the most probable damage modes for improvement goals, which in turn lead to structures with higher reliability in seismic regions.

AB  - This paper proposes a new method for the pattern synthesis of sparse concentric circular array. This method can avoid the premature and improve the poor capability of local optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. Alternatively implementing the two kinds of genetic breeding operations can effectively alleviate the dependence of the algorithm's convergence on the choice of the initial group. This paper takes the nine-ringed concentric circular array as simulation object. The results show that the number of array elements can be decreased from 278 to 140 with the simultaneous reduction in peak sidelobe level to -21.27dB, and the distortion of mainlobe is avoided.

AB  - Tomato can be injured by two very important physiological disorders, namely blossom end rot (BER) and fruit cracking (FC). The purpose of this review is to describe these physiological disorders and to assess whether cultivar and cropping system can minimise their symptoms. Physiological Ca deficiency is usually related to the inability of the plant to translocate adequate Ca to the affected plant part, rather than to insufficient Ca levels in the growing medium. The first visible symptom of BER is a small darkened or water-soaked area around the blossom end of the fruit, appearing about the time the fruit begins to ripen. The spot darkens, enlarges, and becomes sunken as the fruit matures. Large lesions may show in concentric rings. FC is the splitting of the epidermis around the calyx or stem scar. FC is a physiological disorder, which mainly occurs when there is a rapid net influx of solutes and especially water into the fruit, while at the same time ripening or other factors reduce the strength and elasticity of the tomato skin. This review article gives an overview of the causes of BER and FC and summarizes growing methods aimed at reducing these physiological disorders of tomatoes.

KW  - RECOGNITION
AB  - The focus of this paper is on presentation attack detection for the iris biometrics, which measures the pattern within the colored concentric circle of the subjects' eyes, to authenticate an individual to a generic user verification system. Unlike previous deep learning methods that use single convolutional neural network architectures, this paper develops a framework built upon triplet convolutional networks that takes as input two real iris patches and a fake patch or two fake patches and a genuine patch. The aim is to increase the number of training samples and to generate a representation that separates the real from the fake iris patches. The smaller architecture provides a way to do early stopping based on the liveness of single patches rather than the whole image. The matching is performed by computing the distance with respect to a reference set of real and fake examples. The proposed approach allows for real-time processing using a smaller network and provides equal or better than state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets of photo-based and contact lens presentation attacks.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to propose an optimized overview of firefly algorithm (FA) over physical-natural impression of fireflies and its application in mobile robot navigation under the natural intelligence mechanism.
   Design/methodology/approach - The brightness and luminosity are the decision variables in proposed study. The paper achieves the two major goals of robot navigation; first, the optimum path generation and, second, as an obstacle avoidance by co-in-centric sphere-based geometrical technique. This technique comprises the optimum path decision to objective function and constraints to paths and obstacles as the function of algebraic-geometry co-relation. Co-in-centric sphere is the proposed technique to correlate the constraints.
   Findings - It is found that the present FA based on concentric sphere is suitable for efficient navigation of mobile robots at the level of optimum significance when compared with other approaches.
   Originality/value - The paper introduces a novel approach to implement the FA for unknown and uncertain environment.

The population density and abundance of a number of background species was ascertained to decrease from the subalpine belt towards the forest and alpine belt. The bird population density in all the considered aquatic and semiaquatic habitats was revealed to change in a rather narrow range of values: the maximal population density indicator in aquatic and semiaquatic habitats is only 1.9 times higher than the minimal indicator. In the mountainous Subarctic region with a radial macrosymmetry, the spatial dynamics of abundance has a concentrically centrifugal nature in many aquatic and semiaquatic bird species.

AB  - Robust image hashing techniques have been extensively studied in the recent years, with constant improvements. The challenge is that the hashing schemes need to be robust to most content-preservation operations (CPOs) and at the same time have reliable discriminative capability. One of the most important application of such image hashing techniques is image authentication. Most of the existing image hashing techniques are not robust to geometric attacks e.g. rotation and composite rotation-scaling-translation (RST). In this paper, we propose a novel image authentication model that uses a blind approach for geometric distortion correction. The hashing scheme is based on concentric square partition and statistical feature vector distances, thus making it perceptually robust and at the same time sensitive to visually distinct images. Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art models and gives desirable result for all CPOs and geometric attacks as well.

KW  - EARTHQUAKE
AB  - This paper examines the effects of foundation uplift on the dynamic response of steel frames supported by shallow foundations. In order to achieve this goal, the dynamic responses of a number of two-dimensional concentrically braced steel frames with fixed base, flexible base preventing uplift, and flexible base allowing uplift, are compared. The steel frames are modeled by considering material nonlinearities and P-Delta effects, while the soil-foundation system is modeled through the Winkler foundation approach. The dynamic analyses are conducted using 15 far-fault ground-motions with various intensities and different response parameters are monitored. According to the achieved responses, the presence of foundation uplift generally increases the total displacement demands and reduces the inter-story drift ratio and ductility demands. The important parameters affecting the responses of uplift-permitted frames are also introduced and examined.

AB  - Purpose: Muscle strength is one of the key components in almost every sports performance. There are methods which can objectively quantify the actual status of athletes. A considerable amount of research papers has been published. They are focused on torque, position and time parameters with using isokinetic strength testing but often without any practical usage in real conditions. These studies often only describe and compare the sports disciplines or they try to evaluate concentric peak torque changes in time after selected interventions. On the other hand, too little attention is paid to eccentric strength and strength ratio between plantar and dorsiflexion of ankle joint. Strength ratio is well discussed especially for concentric flexion with concentric extension knee muscle strength within the same leg or combination of eccentric flexion and concentric extension. However, questions have been raised about using strength ratio in regards to predicting muscle regeneration or injury's prevention as well. The objective of presented research is to purpose the effect of different pressure levels of compression calf sleeves used during uphill running on selected isokinetic parameters.
   Methods: The study was designed as a double-blind controlled laboratory study because of the elimination of researcher bias. Ten endurance-trained male athletes (age 24.8 +/- 3.45 years; body weight 74.11 +/- 8.63 kg; body height 1.81 +/- 0.08 m; weekly running distance 43.0 +/- 5.4 km; 10 km best time 38.0 +/- 1.5 min) performed three 8 km treadmill runs at 75% VO2max with 6% incline while wearing compression calf sleeves (two types of graduated compression calf sleeves and one type inversely graduated compression). Maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric contraction and maximal voluntary isokinetic eccentric contraction of plantar flexors and dorsiflexors were recorded at 60 degrees/sec and 120 degrees/sec over 6 contractions with a Humac Norm dynamometer.
   Results: No significant differences were found between graduated compression calf sleeves in peak torque of plantar flexors and dorsiflexors during isokinetic concentric and eccentric contraction (60 degrees/s, 120 degrees/s) in pre-test, 24 and 48 hours after the running protocol. Interestingly, analyses showed the significant difference in increasing peak torque of plantar flexors and dorsiflexors (60 degrees/s, 120 degrees/s) for inversely graduated compression calf sleeves during the isokinetic eccentric contraction. A difference between pre-test and 48 hours post run (p = 0.04123) was found.
   Conclusion: The obtained data indicate that inversely graduated compression calf sleeves (a higher pressure over the calf than over the ankle) may be much more practical during running especially in hilly mountainous terrain not only for running performance but also for reducing delayed onset muscle soreness.

TI  - Stability of Steel Columns in Steel Concentrically Braced Frames Subjected to Seismic Loading
T2  - STRUCTURES CONGRESS 2017: BUILDINGS AND SPECIAL STRUCTURES
LA  - English
CP  - Structures Congress
AB  - Lateral loads primarily induce axial loads in members of steel concentrically braced frames but columns may also be subjected to drift induced bending moments that may affect their strength and stability. The article discusses three examples of CBF columns that are subjected to combined axial compression and bending moments in structures under severe seismic ground motions: columns at an intermediate level where soft-story response develops in an existing seismically deficient X-bracing, fixed base columns at the first level of a well-proportioned multi-story X-bracing system, and columns in multi-tiered braced steel frames. Nonlinear dynamic analysis of the columns is performed to examine their stability response under axial and bending demands. In the first two cases, the results indicate that bending moments have limited effects on the global stability of the columns. Conversely, columns in multi-tiered frames must be designed to resist the expected combined axial and flexural demands in order to prevent column instability.

AB  - Danon disease is a rare X-linked dominant skeletal and cardiac muscle disorder presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, skeletal myopathy, and mild intellectual disability. Early morbidity and mortality due to heart failure or sudden death are known in Danon disease, more in males than in females. Here, we present a 17-year-old female adolescent withDanon disease and severe concentric hypertrophy with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, who has been complaining of intermittent headache and weakness for about 3 years, initially diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine. Subsequently, her neurological manifestation progressed to transient ischemic attack (TIA) and eventually to ischemic stroke confirmed by CT scan with 1-day history of expressive aphasia followed by persistent left side weakness and numbness. Detailed echocardiogram for the first time revealed a small LV apical thrombus with unchanged severe biventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function. This unexpected LV apical thrombus may be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological deficits ranging from TIA to ischemic stroke in Danon disease. Possibility of cerebral ischemic events should be suspected in Danon disease when presenting with neurological deficits even with normal systolic function. Careful assessment for LV apical thrombus is warranted in such cases.

AB  - Glenoid component loosening is one of common complications after total shoulder arthroplasty. In investigating the glenoid component loosening, the finite element study is one of methods that have been utilised by experts. Therefore, assigning material properties for all finite element models become crucial to avoid any misinterpretation which, later, lead to wrong prediction on the performance of glenoid implant. This study was conducted to achieve two objectives; (1) to analyse the effect of different bone properties towards micromotion and stress at implant and cement, and (2) to clarify simplification of bone properties in evaluating glenoid component loosening. A load of 750N was simulated at three different glenoid locations (centre - C, superior-anterior-SA, superior-posterior-SP) which imitate concentric and eccentric loadings for elderly people daily activities. Our result showed that large different in micromotion and stress at implant between orthotropic model and another two model (isotropic and full cortical) does not allow simplification for assigning material properties for bone. Thus, assigning cancellous bone as orthotropic material was a realistic material property to represent the real bone condition in evaluating glenoid implant loosening.

In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical and pathological features of IPCC in renal biopsy to avoid over-diagnosis and to determine the diagnostic basis. 4 IPCC cases diagnosed over a 4-year period (2012-2015) were evaluated for the study. Meanwhile, 5 cases of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis and 5 cases of lupus nephritis (LN) were selected as control. Appropriate clinical data, morphology, and immunohistochemical features of all cases were retrieved. Results showed that the basement membrane of glomerulus with IPCC appeared as a concentric twisted ball, and glomerular cells of the lesion were reduced even entirely absent, and the adjacent afferent arterioles showed sclerosis or luminal stenosis. Furthermore, immune globulin deposition, vasculitis, and fibrinous exudate have not been observed in IPCC. While the cellular crescents showed diverse characteristics in both morphology and immunostaining in the control group. Therefore, these results indicated that IPCC is a sort of ischemic reactive hyperplasia and associated with sclerosis, stenosis, or obstruction of adjacent afferent arterioles, which is clearly different from cellular crescents result from glomerulonephritis.

AB  - A new genus and species of a large ghost moth (Lepidoptera, Exoporia, Hepialidae) is described from south central Peru based on a single pair of adults, male and female. Viridigigas ciseskii, new genus, new species, is recorded from two locations along the eastern versant of the Amazonian Andes. Its phylogenetic position within the Hepialidae is currently inconclusive with some features suggestive of affinity with two other genera, Puermytrans Viette, 1951 (Chile), and Phassodes Bethune-Baker, 1905 (Fiji). The forewing pattern is distinct from all other Hepialidae, consisting of green with numerous sub-circular dark brown to yellowish brown spots of irregular shape enclosed by up to three concentric dark brown lines. In the male a prominent scent gland is present at the base of the fore wing and the metatibia support well-developed, elongate androconia.

AB  - Background & Study Aim: Using isokinetic testing in order to detect antagonist/agonist strength ratios we can get reliable and reproducible measurements which can be used for injury prevention. Knowledge of these phenomena is essential in order to detect possible differences and similarities, as well as compare results between genders of karate athletes. The aim of this study is isokinetic profile in elite female and male karate athletes.
   Material & Methods: The testing group was comprised of 9 male and 9 female karate athletes and they were all members of National karate team of Serbia. Each participant completed the testing in single session (similar to 1.5 h), and each group completed the testing over the course of 3 days, with testing occurring at the same time of the day. We investigated conventional concentric strength ratios and contralateral differences for both shoulders and knees at both 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s testing speeds. For the results analysis, the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), version 20.0 was used.
   Results: Significant differences were observed in knee and shoulder strength between female and male karate athletes. Both female and male karate athletes showed recommended results for conventional concentric H: Q strength ratio, as well as in contralateral concentric H and Q strength ratio. Also, both athletes showed higher conventional concentric ER: IR strength ratio than recommended.
   Conclusions: There was a number of individuals with imbalances greater than recommended, but karate group as a whole was at a low risk of musculoskeletal injury and it can be concluded that karate stimulate body symmetrically during training over the years.

AB  - The purpose of study was to identify the presence of strength asymmetries (SA) in young elite soccer players in relation to muscle group (knee extensors (KE) and flexors (KF)) and limb preference (dominant vs. non-dominant limb). Forty- one U16 national team soccer players (mean age 15.7 +/- 0.3 years, body height 177.9 +/- 6.6 cm, body weight 68.2 +/- 7.9 kg) participated in this study. Assessments were performed on a Cybex Humac Norm isokinetic dynamometer in concentric contraction. We noted the degree of SAs in the bilateral ratio of quadriceps and hamstrings and in the ipsilateral ratio of the dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NL) legs. Bilateral deficits of KFs were higher (9.02-12.61 %) than those of KFs (6.32-7.15 %). The percentage of SA (> 10 %) in knee extensors was 19.531.7 %. The percentage of SA (> 10 %) in knee flexors was 36.6-51.2 %. At the lowest velocity, there was a significantly higher prevalence of SAs in KFs than in KEs (chi(2) = 4.11, p<. 05). The ipsilateral ratio was lowest at the lowest velocity regardless of limb dominance (DL: 58.95-63.27 %, NL: 56.58-60.11 %). At each velocity, the percentage of SA was higher for the non- dominant limb (12.2-24.4 %) than for the dominant one (4.9-14.6 %). Despite these differences, we did not find any significantly higher prevalence of SA in the non-dominant limb than in the dominant one (chi(2)=.35-2.04, p>. 05). The results of the study suggest that more than 73.2 % of players have at least one SA. More attention should be paid to knee flexors, where a higher percentage of strength asymmetries were observed; furthermore, a higher percentage of strength asymmetry was seen in the non- dominant lower limb.

KW  - ISOKINETIC STRENGTH
AB  - Background: Hamstring injury is a common problem in many sports, especially those involving acceleration and maximal sprints. Hamstring strains are both common and painful. During sprinting the hip flexor and knee extensor torques are frequently produced and is opposed by the hamstring muscles, hence there are numerous studies done on the muscle strength training to prevent the hamstring strain injury as it is statistically stated as the highest rate involved injury in the contact sport. This study has been focused to evaluate the effectiveness of concentric and eccentric exercises in improving hamstring muscle strength and power among futsal players.
   Method: Thirty recreational futsal players were recruited for the study and were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received either hamstring curl exercise (concentric) or Nordic hamstring exercise (eccentric) twice a week for 4 weeks. The manual muscle test (MMT) and 40-yard dash test was used to evaluate the muscle strength and power respectively by comparing the pretest and posttest values for both groups.
   Results: Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that there is no statistically significant difference between pre and post test values of MMT (Concentric (right side, z=.317; left side, z=.157), Eccentric (right side, z=.157; left side, z=.317)) in both groups. Based on paired 't' test there is a significant difference between the pre and post test on improving muscle power [Concentric group, P=.020; Eccentric Group, P=.000]. Mann-Whitney U test and unpaired 't' test showed that there is no significant difference between both groups of MMT (z=.775) and 40-yard dash test (P=.707) respectively.
   Conclusion: The concentric strength training and eccentric strength training have a similar effect in improving hamstring muscle power in futsal players.

AB  - As the two major non-Arab powers of the Middle East, Turkey and Iran have, for a long time, walked the fine line between cooperation and rivalry while competing for regional primacy. In this article, the author argues that recent developments have added new layers of complexity to bilateral relations and that the current nature of the Turkey-Iran relationship can be primarily characterized as interactions, contradictions, and their unintended consequences that revolve around three major concentric circles: the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), the Syrian civil war, and economic-based cooperation. According to the author, the economic convergence of interests between Turkey and Iran, particularly in a post-sanctions environment, counterbalances sharp geopolitical differences, thereby preventing the escalation of friction between the two regional powers.

AB  - In this work we study wavefront propagation for a chemotaxis reaction-diffusion system describing the demyelination in Multiple Sclerosis. Through a weakly non linear analysis, we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau equation governing the evolution of the amplitude of the pattern. We validate the analytical findings through numerical simulations. We show the existence of traveling wavefronts connecting two different steady solutions of the equations. The proposed model reproduces the progression of the disease as a wave: for values of the chemotactic parameter below threshold, the wave leaves behind a homogeneous plaque of apoptotic oligodendrocytes. For values of the chemotactic coefficient above threshold, the model reproduces the formation of propagating concentric rings of demyelinated zones, typical of Balo's sclerosis.

AB  - In many species of phytoplankton, simple photoreceptors monitor ambient lighting. Photoreceptors provide a number of selective advantages including the ability to assess the time of day for circadian rhythms, seasonal changes, and the detection of excessive light intensities and harmful UV light. Photoreceptors also serve as depth gauges in the water column for behaviors such as diurnal vertical migration. Photoreceptors can be organized together with screening pigment into visible eyespots. In a wide variety of motile phytoplankton, including Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Euglena, and Kryptoperidinium, eyespots are light-sensitive organelles residing within the cell. Eyespots are composed of photoreceptor proteins and typically red to orange carotenoid screening pigments. This association of photosensory pigment with screening pigment allows for detection of light directionality, needed for light-guided behaviors such as positive and negative phototaxis. In Chlamydomonas, the eyespot is located in the chloroplast and Chlamydomonas expresses a number of photosensory pigments including the microbial channelrhodopsins (ChR1 and ChR2). Dinoflagellates are unicellular protists that are ecologically important constituents of the phytoplankton. They display a great deal of diversity in morphology, nutritional modes and symbioses, and can be photosynthetic or heterotrophic, feeding on smaller phytoplankton. Dinoflagellates, such as Kryptoperidinium foliaceum, have eyespots that are used for light-mediated tasks including phototaxis. Dinoflagellates belonging to the family Warnowiaceae have a more elaborate eye. Their eye-organelle, called an ocelloid, is a large, elaborate structure consisting of a focusing lens, highly ordered retinal membranes, and a shield of dark pigment. This complex eye-organelle is similar to multicellular camera eyes, such as our own. Unraveling the molecular makeup, structure and function of dinoflagellate eyes, as well as light-guided behaviors in phytoplankton can inform us about the selective forces that drove evolution in the important steps from light detection to vision. We show here that the evolution from simple photoreception to vision seems to have independently followed identical paths and principles in phytoplankton and animals, significantly strengthening our understanding of this important biological process.

AB  - A seismic design strategy, which is intended to be implemented within the framework of the U.S. seismic design provisions for steel structures, is presented for single-story steel concentrically braced frames that are divided into two tiers. In this method, the columns are designed to resist the axial loads acting in combination with the in-plane flexural demand resulting from uneven distribution of brace inelastic deformations over the frame height. This design procedure, which establishes enhanced requirements beyond the 2010 edition of the U.S. seismic design provisions, prevents concentration of deformation in one tier and causes frame nonlinear deformation to be distributed between the tiers. The column bending moments depend on the story shear resistance that develops in each tier when the bracing members are at buckling and in the postbuckling range. The method also aims to control tier drifts to protect the bracing members from excessive inelastic demand, which could cause brace fracture. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are performed to validate the proposed design procedure.

AB  - Upon vessel injury, platelets become activated and rapidly reorganize their actin cytoskeleton to adhere to the site of endothelial damage, triggering the formation of a fibrin-rich plug to prevent further blood loss. Inactivation of Pdlim7 provides the new perspective that regulation of actin cytoskeletal changes in platelets is dependent on the encoded PDZ-LIM protein. Loss-of-function of Pdlim7 triggers hypercoagulopathy and causes significant perinatal lethality in mice. Our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that Pdlim7 is dynamically distributed along actin fibers, and lack of Pdlim7 leads to a marked inability to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton. Specifically, the absence of Pdlim7 prevents platelets from bundling actin fibers into a concentric ring that defines the round spread shape of activated platelets. Similarly, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, loss of Pdlim7 abolishes the formation of stress fibers needed to adopt the typical elongated fibroblast shape. In addition to revealing a fundamental cell biological role in actin cytoskeletal organization, we also demonstrate a function of Pdlim7 in regulating the cycling between the GTP/GDP-bound states of Arf6. The small GTPase Arf6 is an essential factor required for actin dynamics, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and platelet activation. Consistent with our findings of significantly elevated initial F-actin ratios and subsequent morphological aberrations, loss of Pdlim7 causes a shift in balance towards an increased Arf6-GTP level in resting platelets. These findings identify a new Pdlim7-Arf6 axis controlling actin dynamics and implicate Pdlim7 as a primary endogenous regulator of platelet-dependent hemostasis.

AB  - Managing crop viruses is difficult due to complex interactions among vectors, reservoirs, and mediating factors such as land cover. Identifying the appropriate ecological neighborhood, or the spatial area in which the most influential interactions occur affecting virus epidemiology, would therefore be beneficial in exposing which of the many explanatory variables to target in the plant-pathogen system. We constructed partial least squares path models to find the neighborhood size for vectors of stylet-borne nonpersistent viruses infecting pumpkins, and compare the relative influence of within-field and extra field land cover. Two economically important aphid-vectored viruses in the U.S. Midwest are included in these analyses: papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). In 2010 and 2011, we used commercial pumpkin fields to quantify virus infection, vector (aphid) alightment (i.e., landing rates), and within-field weed communities, and subsequently analyzed extra-field cover from 1 to 5 km concentric buffer zones within the surrounding landscape. Alightment rates of total noncolonizing vectors and the top three numerically dominant species (Aphis craccivora Koch, Therioaphis trifolii (Monell), and Rhopalosiphum padi [L.]) were included in individual path models. Overall, we found that extra-field landscape composition had a far stronger influence on vector alightment than within-field weed cover; this pattern was consistent for seven of eight statistical models. In one exception, weed cover influenced alightment of the putative PRSV vector, A. craccivora, while surrounding landscape had no effect. In this case, weed coverage and vector alightment were inversely related, demonstrating that aphids were less likely to land in weed-infested fields. However, weed cover did not predict alightment of T. trifolii or total noncolonizers. The neighborhood size scales for total noncolonizers' tended to be larger than for individual species (4-5 km), suggesting future studies of dispersal by multi-species aphid groups may benefit from an extended gradient. On balance, our results indicate that while surrounding land cover interactions are complex, they exert greater influence over vector dispersal than within-field weed cover, calling into question whether management of local weeds is an effective method of crop virus prevention in some systems.

AB  - The current study conducted a careful description of the histological events during the embryonic development of quail stomach. Daily histological specimens from the quail stomach from day 4 to day 17 post incubation were examined by light microscopy. The primitive gut tube of the embryonic quail appeared at day 4 post incubation. The gut tube consisted of an endodermal epithelium of pseudostratified type, surrounded by splanchnic mesenchyme. The prospective glandular epithelium invaginated at day 5 in the proventriculus and gradually developed to prospective proventricular glands. The muscular coat became distinguished at day 7 and day 8 in the proventriculus and gizzard, respectively. Transformation into simple columnar epithelium occurred in both proventriculus and the gizzard at day 12. The gizzard epithelium gave rise to tubular invaginations also at day 12. Canalization of the gizzard tubular glands was recognized at day 14. By day 15, the proventricular surface epithelium invaginated in a concentric manner around a central cavity to form immature secretory units that contained inactive oxyntico-peptic cells. The mucosal folding in the gizzard appeared at day 15 to form plicae and sulci. The wall of the proventriculus and gizzard at day 17 acquired histological features of post-hatching birds.

AB  - The present study investigated how budgerigars and humans perceive a version of the Delboeuf illusion. In Experiment 1, we trained 4 budgerigars to discriminate between the sizes of two square targets, one of which was embedded in a concentric square frame. The birds accurately differentiated between the sizes of the targets when the target size disparity was large; however, when this disparity was small, they tended to choose the target embedded in the frame. Experiment 2 used the same stimuli and task as Experiment 1 but the participants were humans; the results suggested that the human participants perceived a normal Delboeuf illusion. Thus, these results indicate the adequacy of our stimuli and the inadequacy of tasks with two choices in comparative studies of the Delboeuf illusion as the simultaneous presentation of the two illusory figure(s) may cause unexpected choice bias.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots are complex morphological traits that can vary in size, shape and color composition even on the same wing surface. Homology among eyespots suggests they share a common developmental basis and function as an integrated unit in response to selection. Despite strong evidence of genetic integration, eyespots can also exhibit modularity or plasticity, indicating an underlying flexibility in pattern development. The extent to which particular eyespots or eyespot color elements exhibit modularity or integration is poorly understood, particularly following exposure to novel conditions. We used perturbation experiments to explore phenotypic correlations among different eyespots and their color elements on the ventral hindwing of V. cardui. Specifically, we identified which eyespots and eyespot features are most sensitive to perturbation by heat shock and injection of heparin-a cold shock mimic. For both treatments, the two central eyespots (3 + 4) were most affected by the experimental perturbations, whereas the outer eyespot border was more resistant to modification than the interior color elements. Overall, the individual color elements displayed a similar response to heat shock across all eyespots, but varied in their response to each other. Graphical modeling also revealed that although eyespots differ morphologically, regulation of eyespot size and colored elements appear to be largely integrated across the wing. Patterns of integration, however, were disrupted following heat shock, revealing that the strength of integration varies across the wing and is strongest between the two central eyespots. These findings support previous observations that document coupling between eyespots 3 + 4 in other nymphalid butterflies.

AB  - Most common preventive eccentric-based exercises, such as Nordic hamstring do not include any hip flexion. So, the elongation stress reached is lower than during the late swing phase of sprinting. The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of hamstring architectural (fascicle length and pennation angle) and functional (concentric and eccentric optimum angles and concentric and eccentric peak torques) parameters following a 3-week eccentric resistance program performed at long (LML) vs. short muscle length (SML). Both groups performed eight sessions of 3-5 X 8 slow maximal eccentric knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer: the SML group at 0 degrees and the LML group at 80 degrees of hip flexion. Architectural parameters were measured using ultrasound imaging and functional parameters using the isokinetic dynamometer. The fascicle length increased by 4.9% (p < 0.01, medium effect size) in the SML and by 9.3% (p < 0.001, large effect size) in the LML group. The pennation angle did not change (p = 0.83) in the SML and tended to decrease by 0.7 degrees (p = 0.09, small effect size) in the LML group. The concentric optimum angle tended to decrease by 8.8 degrees (p = 0.09, medium effect size) in the SML and by 17.3 degrees (p < 0.01, large effect size) in the LML group. The eccentric optimum angle did not change (p = 0.19, small effect size) in the SML and tended to decrease by 10.7 degrees (p = 0.06, medium effect size) in the LML group. The concentric peak torque did not change in the SML (p = 0.37) and the LML (p = 0.23) groups, whereas eccentric peak torque increased by 12.9% (p < 0.01, small effect size) and 17.9% (p < 0.001, small effect size) in the SML and the LML group, respectively. No group-by-time interaction was found for any parameters. A correlation was found between the training-induced change in fascicle length and the change in concentric optimum angle (r = -0.57, p < 0.01). These results suggest that performing eccentric exercises lead to several architectural and functional adaptations. However, further investigations are required to confirm the hypothesis that performing eccentric exercises at LML may lead to greater adaptations than a similar training performed at SML.

AB  - In binocular viewing, images presented to the amblyopic eye are suppressed in the cortex to prevent confusion or diplopia. The present study measures depth and extent of interocular suppression across the central circular 248 visual field in observers with strabismus and microstrabismus. Visual stimuli were concentric rings of alternating polarity, each divided into sectors. Rings were defined by luminance (L), luminance-modulated noise (LM), or contrast-modulated noise (CM). They were viewed binocularly except for the tested ring, which was viewed dichoptically, so that the modulation of one sector presented to the weaker or amblyopic eye was adjusted to perceptually match the surrounding ring presented to the preferred eye. A two alternative forced-choice paradigm combined with a staircase procedure allowed for measurement of the point of subjective equality, or perceptual match. Depth of suppression was calculated as the difference between physical modulations presented to the two eyes at this point. Strabismic participants showed suppression deeper centrally than peripherally, and in one hemifield of the visual field more than the other. Suppression was deeper for L than LM, and CM than LM stimuli. Microstrabismic suppression was weaker than that of strabismics, central for L and LM stimuli, with suppression of CM stimuli being broader, deeper and more in one hemifield. Suppression depth was positively correlated with interocular visual acuity difference and stereoacuity reduction. Clinically, LM stimuli could be used for assessment of deeper amblyopes to assess suppression patterns, while more sensitive detection of mild suppression would be possible using CM stimuli.

AB  - A spatial turn' is observed as taking place across a range of disciplines. This article discusses the relevance of this spatial turn' to the issue of early school leaving prevention and engagement of marginalised students and their parents within the educational system and other support services. Building on reconceptualisation of an aspect of structural anthropology a specific dynamic spatial interaction between diametric and concentric structures of relation is proposed. Reification is interpreted as involving a diametric space of assumed separation, closure and mirror image inversions. Concentric relational space as assumed connection and relative openness is a precondition for trust, care and voice. Diametric and concentric spatial features of school and related systems are interrogated for early school leaving issues, such as the importance of relational supports to keep students in the system; the precondition of trust for parental involvement of more marginalised parents, including a lifelong learning and family support aspect; the need to challenge the school as a closed system with reified hierarchies.

TI  - Shatter cones at the Keurusselka a impact structure and their relation to local jointing

KW  - FOLDS
AB  - Shatter cones are the only distinct meso-to macroscopic recognition criterion for impact structures, yet not all is known about their formation. The Keurusselka impact structure, Finland, is interesting in that it presents a multitude of well-exposed shatter cones in medium-to coarse-grained granitoids. The allegedly 27 km wide Keurusselka impact structure was formed about 1150 Ma ago in rocks of the Central Finland Granitoid Complex. Special attention was paid in this work to possible relationships between shatter cones and local, as well as regionally occurring, fracture or joint systems. A possible shatter cone find outside the previously suggested edge of the structure could mean that the Keurusselka impact structure is larger than previously thought. The spacing between joints/fractures from regional joint systems was influenced by the impact, but impact-induced fractures strongly follow the regional joint orientation trends. There is a distinct relationship between shatter cones and joints: shatter cones occur on and against joint surfaces of varied orientations and belonging to the regional orientation trends. Planar fractures (PF) and planar deformation features (PDF) were found in three shatter cone samples from the central-most part of the impact structure, whereas other country rock samples from the same level of exposure but further from the assumed center lack shock deformation features. PDF occurrence is enhanced within 5 mm of shatter cone surfaces, which is interpreted to suggest that shock wave reverberation at preimpact joints could be responsible for this local enhancement of shock deformation. Some shatter cone surfaces are coated with a quasi-opaque material which is also found in conspicuous veinlets that branch off from shatter cone surfaces and resemble pseudotachylitic breccia veins. The vein-filling is composed of two mineral phases, one of which could be identified as a montmorillonitic phyllosilicate. The second phase could not be identified yet. The original composition of the fill could not be determined. Further work is required on this material. Observed joints and fractures were discussed against findings from Barringer impact crater. They show that impact-induced joints in the basement rock do not follow impact-specific orientations (such as radial, conical, or concentric).

AB  - Background :
   The natural, inflammatory repair processes of an injured intervertebral degenerative disc can propagate further injury and destruction. While there are many different treatment modalities of the pain related to degenerative disc disease, none are actually reparative in nature. Treatment strategies to repair a degenerative disc without inducing a destructive inflammatory milieu have been elusive.
   Purpose:
   The purpose of this experiment is to discover the feasibility of reconstructing an injured intervertebral disc using an injected, inert polymer as the foundation for endogenous collagen growth.
   Study Design:
   In this ovine model of six subjects in total, we introduce a modality where a large inert polymer, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), in conjunction bovine collagen (BC) is injected into the intervertebral disc. Following six months of observation, histologic specimens were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically for evidence of a benefit of the injectable PMMA/BC.
   Methods:
   We obtained six merino sheep for this study. Concentric injuries were made to four of their lumbar intervertebral discs. Two of those levels were treated with a percutaneous injection of 0.3 cc of PMMA/BC. The remaining lumbar levels were left untreated and were our controls. After six months, all subjects were sacrificed. Their four levels were extracted and were examined macroscopically and microscopically.
   Results:
   All subjects tolerated the lumbar injury and percutaneous injection of PMMA/BC well. After the six month interval, all subjects have demonstrated an intact architecture of their lumbar disc height at the macroscopic and microscopic level. Microscopically, there was no evidence of external migration of the PMMA/BC microspheres, nor was there any evidence of an inflammatory response by its presence. Notably, the PMMA/BC microspheres were well-incorporated into the concentric disc tears and had undergone endogenous collagen formation in its environment. Treatment levels were revealing for maintenance of disc height without evidence of an ongoing degeneration. The controlled levels were revealing for continued disc degeneration with loss of disc height and evolving injury at the level of the concentric tear.
   Conclusions:
   This ovine model demonstrates a novel and promising technique for prevention and arrest of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration.

AB  - Context: Many studies have explored closed kinetic chain (CKC) shoulder exercises (SEs) with a sling because they are safer and more effective than open-chain exercises, especially in early stages of treatment. However, the application of CKC SE in youth baseball players has rarely been attempted, although teenage baseball players also experience shoulder pain. Objective: To investigate the effects of CKC SE on the peak torque of shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) in youth baseball players. Design: Single-group pretest, posttest. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: 23 Little League Baseball players with subacromial impingement syndrome. Interventions: The CKC SE with a sling was CKC shoulder-flexion exercise, extension exercise, IR exercise, and ER exercise. This exercise regimen was conducted 2 or 3 times/wk for 8 wk. Main Outcome Measures: The peak torque of shoulder ER and ER was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Concentric shoulder rotation was performed, with 5 repetitions at an angular velocity of 60 /s and 15 at 180 /s. Results: The IR and ER peak torque significantly increased at each angular velocity after the exercise program. In particular, the increase in IR and ER peak torque values was statistically significant at an angular velocity of 180 /s. Conclusions: CKC SE was effective in increasing shoulder IR and ER strength, demonstrating its potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of shoulder injury. In addition, increased IR peak torque appears to improve throwing velocity in baseball players.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic otits media is long standing infection of middle ear cleft which commonly involves bone erosion. Bone destruction seen in unsafe chronic otitis media mainly involves the ossicles, incus being frequently involved ossicle. So, an investigation of the histopathological changes in incus was carried out to report the various histopathological changes occurring in chronic otitis media.
   Aim: Aim of the study is to report the structural changes occuring in incus bone in chronic otitis media.
   Materials and Methods: Ten normal incuses and ten pathological incuses which were removed during the surgery for chronic otitis media (both with and without cholesteotoma) were studied histologically, after staining with haematoxylin and eosin.
   Results: Normal incus showed compact bone pattern of concentric rings, like that of any long bone of body. Pathological incuses of chronic otitis media (both with and without cholestoetoma) showed similar changes, i.e., stratified squamous epithelium, with distorted concentric rings and increased osseous spaces.
   Conclusion: The study was undertaken, so that the knowledge to histological changes may help the clinicians to take more rational decisions regarding their diagnosis and therapeutic interventions to prevent the changes occurring in the bone in chronic otitis media.

AB  - Location-based social discovery (LBSD) services enable users to discover their geographic neighborhoods to make new friends. Original LBSD services were designed to provide the exact distances to nearby users. It has been shown that it is easy to pinpoint any target user's location by using trilateration based on the exact distances from three fake Global Positioning System locations to the target user. To defend against the trilateration attack, contemporary LBSD services then began to report distances of nearby users in concentric bands, for example, bands of 100 meters, rather than exact distances. In this paper, we investigate the user location privacy leakage problem in LBSD services reporting distances in discrete bands. Using number theory, we analytically show that by strategically placing multiple virtual probes with fake Global Positioning System locations, one can nevertheless localize user locations in band-based LBSD. Our methodology is guaranteed to localize any reported user within a circle of radius no greater than one meter, even for LBSD services using large bands (such as 100 m as used by WeChat). Eventually, countermeasures are proposed to reduce location privacy leakage to the very minimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly exploits and quantifies user location privacy leakage in band-based LBSD services. We expect our study to draw more public attention to this serious privacy issue and expectantly motivate better privacy preserving LBSD designs. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose of reviewLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an important consequence of hypertension, is traditionally classified as either concentric or eccentric based on the presence or absence of increased relative wall thickness. In 2010, we proposed a novel four-tiered classification that accounted for LV dilatation in addition to LV wall thickness. The purpose of this review is to discuss the rationale for this revised classification and highlight subsequent studies that have assessed its utility.Recent findingsA series of recent observational studies have tested whether the four-tiered classification identifies subphenotypes of LVH with differential risk of adverse outcomes, including incident heart failure. The majority have confirmed that eccentric hypertrophy can be subdivided into a high-risk and a low-risk group based on whether LV dilatation is present. Additional studies have shown that LV dilatation is an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure.SummaryIncorporation of LV dilatation into the assessment of LVH identifies important subphenotypes within the standard two-tiered classification that have differential risk. Such refinements in the classification of LVH may yield new insights into how LVH progresses to heart failure, help identify risk factors for this transition, and improve therapeutic efforts to prevent its occurrence.

AB  - Background: A hamstring strain injury (HSI) has become the most common noncontact injury in soccer. Isokinetic muscle strength deficits are considered a risk factor for HSIs. However, underpowered studies with small sample sizes unable to determine small associations have led to inconclusive results regarding the role of isokinetic strength and strength testing in HSIs.
   Purpose: To examine whether differences in isokinetic strength measures of knee flexion and extension represent risk factors for hamstring injuries in a large cohort of professional soccer players in an adequately powered study design.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: A total of 614 professional soccer players from 14 teams underwent isokinetic strength testing during preseason screening. Testing consisted of concentric knee flexion and extension at 60 deg/s and 300 deg/s and eccentric knee extension at 60 deg/s. A clustered multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with the risk of HSIs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine sensitivity and specificity.
   Results: Of the 614 players, 190 suffered an HSI during the 4 seasons. Quadriceps concentric strength at 60 deg/s (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03-1.92; P = .03) and hamstring eccentric strength at 60 deg/s (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.85; P = .04) adjusted for bodyweight were independently associated with the risk of injuries. The absolute differences between the injured and uninjured players were 6.9 Nm and 9.1 Nm, with small effect sizes (d < 0.2). The ROC analyses showed an area under the curve of 0.54 and 0.56 for quadriceps concentric strength and hamstring eccentric strength, respectively, indicating a failed combined sensitivity and specificity of the 2 strength variables identified in the logistic regression models.
   Conclusion: This study identified small absolute strength differences and a wide overlap of the absolute strength measurements at the group level. The small associations between lower hamstring eccentric strength and lower quadriceps concentric strength with HSIs can only be considered as weak risk factors. The identification of these risk factors still does not allow the identification of individual players at risk. The use of isokinetic testing to determine the association between strength differences and HSIs is not supported.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether athletes with highly flexible hamstring muscle-tendon units display different passive and contractile mechanical properties compared with controls. Flexibility, passive, and active torque-angle properties were assessed in 21 female elite rhythmic gymnasts and 16 female age-matched athletes. Passive resistance to stretch was measured during knee extension with the hip fixed at 100 degrees of flexion. Concentric isokinetic maximal voluntary knee flexion and extension torques were measured at 60 degrees/s in the same position. Tests of flexibility and passive resistance to stretch indicated a greater flexibility in the gymnasts. Despite no differences between groups in knee flexion and extension peak torque, gymnasts reached knee flexion peak torque at more extended positions (longer muscle lengths) and displayed significantly different torque-angle relations. When active torque was corrected for passive resistance to stretch, differences increased, gymnasts producing more work, and maintaining 70% of peak torque over a larger range of joint excursion. In conclusion, individuals with a higher flexibility of the hamstrings MTU present a different torque-angle profile, favoring the production of flexion torque toward extended knee positions, displaying larger functional range of motion and a higher mechanical work output during knee flexion.

AB  - Background-Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G-phosphodiesterase 5 signaling may be disturbed in heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction, contributing to cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to manipulate cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling using the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor saxagliptin and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor tadalafil. We hypothesized that preservation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP signaling would attenuate pathological cardiac remodeling and improve left ventricular (LV) function.
   Methods and Results-We assessed LV hypertrophy and function at the organ and cellular level in aortic-banded pigs. Concentric hypertrophy was equal in all groups, but LV collagen deposition was increased in only HF animals. Prevention of fibrotic remodeling by saxagliptin and tadalafil was correlated with neuropeptide Y plasma levels. Saxagliptin better preserved integrated LV systolic and diastolic function by maintaining normal LV chamber volumes and contractility (end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, preload recruitable SW) while preventing changes to early/late diastolic longitudinal strain rate. Function was similar to the HF group in tadalafil-treated animals including increased LV contractility, reduced chamber volume, and decreased longitudinal, circumferential, and radial mechanics. Saxagliptin and tadalafil prevented a negative cardiomyocyte shortening-frequency relationship observed in HF animals. Saxagliptin increased phosphodiesterase 5 activity while tadalafil increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels; however, neither drug increased downstream PKG activity. Early mitochondrial dysfunction, evident as decreased calcium-retention capacity and Complex I-dependent respiratory control, was present in both HF and tadalafil-treated animals.
   Conclusions-Both saxagliptin and tadalafil prevented increased LV collagen deposition in a manner related to the attenuation of increased plasma neuropeptide Y levels. Saxagliptin appears superior for treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 2 considering its comprehensive effects on integrated LV systolic and diastolic function.

AB  - Due to the increasing use of vehicle bombs on attacking important buildings by terrorist organizations around the world, it is necessary to design buildings with more resistance against blast loads. In this research, numerical studies have been done for three-dimensional structural models of special moment frames, concentrically braced frames, and eccentrically braced frames with 3, 5, and 10 stories. The nonlinear dynamic method is applied for analyzing the models under two different levels of straight and oblique blast loadings based on the UFC 3-340-02. The plastic hinge rotations, ductility ratios, performance levels, and flexural moments in the models are obtained from the analysis and compared with each other. According to the results, it can be said that the eccentrically braced frame systems generally show better performances than other systems under blast loadings. Also due to different shock directions, the values of column plastic rotations and bending moments under oblique blast loadings are less than straight ones.

AB  - The lunar regolith can provide critical information about the Moon and the space environment. In the study of lunar regolith, thickness is one of its most important parameters because of the significance in estimating the relative geologic age and the quantities of solar wind implanted volatiles. In this research, an improved morphological method for determining the lunar regolith thickness is proposed by directly measuring the distance from the lunar ground surface to the floor (flat-bottomed and central-mound craters) or bench (concentric craters) of indicative small fresh craters. The pre-impact ground surface is first modeled with crater edge points through plane fitting, avoiding crater ejecta. Then the lunar regolith thickness is calculated as the distance between the modeled ground surface and the crater floor or bench. The method has been verified at the landing sites of Chang'E-3 rover with high-resolution stereo images from Chang'E-2 orbiter, and the landing sites of Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions with high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter DEM data. All the results are in good agreement with results from in-situ measurements, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method. This method can be applied to estimate lunar regolith thickness where high-precision topographic data is available. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose/Background: Lower limb asymmetry between dominant and nondominant limbs is often associated with injuries. However, there is a lack of evidence about frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) of the knee joint (knee valgus) during drop vertical jump (DVJ) and forward step-up tasks (FSUP) in young basketball players. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the FPPA (i.e., dynamic knee valgus) via 2D video analysis during DVJ and FSUP tasks in the dominant and nondominant limbs of young male basketball players.
   Methods: Twenty seven young male basketball players (age 14.5 +/- 1.3 y, height 161.1 +/- 4.1 cm, weight 64.2 +/- 10.2 kg) participated in this study. The participants were asked to perform a bilateral DVJ and unilateral FSUP tasks. Kinematic analysis of FPPA was completed via a two-dimensional (2D) examination in order to evaluate the knee valgus alignment during the beginning of the concentric phase of each task. Knee valgus alignment was computed considering the angle between the line formed between the markers at the anterior superior iliac spine and middle of the tibiofemoral joint and the line formed from the markers on the middle of the tibiofemoral joint to the middle of the ankle mortise. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate differences in tasks. Standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated to establish random error scores.
   Results: There was no difference in knee valgus angle during the DVJ task between dominant (20.2 +/- 4.4 degrees) and nondominant legs (20 +/- 4.1 degrees; p = 0.067). However, a significant difference was noted during FSUP between the non-dominant limb (18.7 +/- 3.4 degrees) when compared to the dominant (21.7 +/- 3.5 degrees; p = 0.001) limb.
   Conclusion: Two dimensional kinematic analysis of knee FPPA may help coaches and other professionals to detect asymmetries between dominant and nondominant limbs, and to develop training programs with the goal of reducing overall lower extremity injury risk.

AB  - Purpose
   To determine the architectural adaptations of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) after concentric or eccentric strength training interventions and the time course of adaptation during training and detraining.
   Methods
   Participants in this intervention (concentric training group [n = 14], eccentric training group [n = 14], male subjects) completed a 4-wk control period, followed by 6 wk of either concentric- or eccentric-only knee flexor training on an isokinetic dynamometer and finished with 28 d of detraining. Architectural characteristics of BFlh were assessed at rest and during graded isometric contractions using two-dimensional ultrasonography at 28 d prebaseline; baseline; and days 14, 21, and 42 of the intervention and then again after 28 d of detraining.
   Results
   BFlh fascicle length was significantly longer in the eccentric training group (P < 0.05; d range, 2.65-2.98) and shorter in the concentric training group (P < 0.05; d range, -1.62 to -0.96) after 42 d of training compared with baseline at all isometric contraction intensities. After the 28-d detraining period, BFlh fascicle length was significantly reduced in the eccentric training group at all contraction intensities compared with the end of the intervention (P < 0.05; d range, -1.73 to -1.55). There was no significant change in fascicle length of the concentric training group after the detraining period.
   Conclusions
   These results provide evidence that short-term resistance training can lead to architectural alterations in the BFlh. In addition, the eccentric training-induced lengthening of BFlh fascicle length was reversed and returned to baseline values after 28 d of detraining. The contraction mode specific adaptations in this study may have implications for injury prevention and rehabilitation.

AB  - In most of the world, borehole heat exchangers used with closed-loop ground source heat pump systems are backfilled with a low permeability grout to prevent water contamination. However, in Scandinavian countries, a different approach is taken - the borehole is sealed at the top and cased down to solid bedrock. The borehole then naturally fills with groundwater in the annular space between the U-tube and the borehole wall. Compared to grouted boreholes, the groundwater filling is advantageous in that it generally results in low borehole thermal resistance due to buoyancy-driven natural convection enhancing the heat transfer. Although this phenomena has been reported in several papers since the late 1980s, no calculation models have been available for use in either design tools or simulation programs. This paper presents experimental measurements from a single well-instrumented borehole under a range of heat transfer rates and annulus temperatures. Nusselt numbers for natural convection in the annulus are correlated against modified Rayleigh number. The results are verified by comparing to borehole thermal resistances predicted with the correlations to actual measurements from a range of boreholes in Sweden and Norway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Annually, one in three seniors aged over 65 years fall. Balance and strength training can reduce neuromuscular fall risk factors and fall rates. Besides conventional balance and strength training, explosive or high-velocity strength training, eccentric exercises, perturbation-based balance training, trunk strength, and trunk control have also been emphasized. In contrast, aerobic exercise has to date not been included in fall-prevention studies. However, well-developed endurance capacity might attenuate fatigue-induced declines in postural control in sports-related or general activities of daily living. Physical performance indices, such as balance, strength, and endurance, are generally addressed independently in exercise guidelines. This approach seems time consuming and may impede integrative training of sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cardiocirculatory functions required to deal with balance-threatening situations in the elderly. An agility-based conceptual training framework comprising perception and decision making (e.g., visual scanning, pattern recognition, anticipation) and changes of direction (e.g., sudden starts, stops and turns; reactive control; concentric and eccentric contractions) might enable an integrative neuromuscular, cardiocirculatory, and cognitive training. The present paper aims to provide a scientific sketch of how to build such an integrated modular training approach, allowing adaptation of intensity, complexity, and cognitive challenge of the agility tasks to the participant's capacity. Subsequent research should address the (1) link between agility and fall risk factors as well as fall rates, (2) benefit-risk ratios of the proposed approach, (3) psychosocial aspects of agility training (e.g., motivation), and (4) logistical requirements (e.g., equipment needed).

AB  - Studies designed to measure dispersal capacity of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) are needed to provide the epidemiological knowledge necessary to improve management of citrus huanglongbing. In this study, a mark-release-recapture technique was used to investigate whether 1) host or non-host plants of D. citri can act as barriers for dispersing insects and 2) presence or absence of young citrus leaves influence movement of D. citri towards citrus plants. The experimental field consisted of four circular and adjacent areas containing citrus trees, Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. 'Hamlin', planted in concentric circles at 18, 24 and 30 m from the release centre. Insect activity was monitored by recapturing at each distance using yellow stick traps. Dense plantings of tall non-host plants of D. citri such as corn had no effect on insect dispersal towards citrus plants when compared to a shorter cover crop such as grass. In contrast, suitable host plants acted as traps decreasing movement of D. citri. Diaphorina citri dispersed at greater speeds in the absence of young leaves reaching 140 m within 6 hours after release, whereas in the presence of young leaves, individuals reached at most 60 m at 1 day after release. Results suggest that D. citri control measures may be more efficient during periods of highest vegetative activity when insects are less active. Moreover, the use of suitable host plants for D. citri as trap plants may be a potential tactic to prevent movement of insects into the crop.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hamstring:quadriceps ratios (HQRs) have been studied as potential markers for an athlete's risk of injury, but little is known about how sport-specific experience affects HQRs.
   OBJECTIVE: This study compared isokinetic and isotonic strength measures, including determining HQRs, between American collegiate male rugby athletes with at least two years of experience (XP; n = 10) and those with less than two years of experience (IN; n = 14).
   METHODS: Isokinetic concentric (ConH) and eccentric (EccH) hamstring and concentric only quadriceps (ConQ) strength was measured at 60 and 180 degrees/s. The strength ratio: Hcon/Qcon (HQR), was calculated for both velocities, HQR(60), HQR(180), while the strength ratio: ConH/ConQ, the dynamic control ratio (DCR), was likewise calculated, DCR60 and DCR180. The isotonic strength was assessed via squat 1-repetition maximum. Analysis of covariance was used to examine differences between IN and XP while body weight and age served as the covariates.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between groups in isokinetic or isotonic strength. However, a significant difference was observed in DCR60 (p = 0.047) between the two groups, with XP (0.94 +/- 0.11) being greater than IN (0.81 +/- 0.16).
   CONCLUSIONS: In view of the preliminary nature of this study, the implication of this finding is yet obscure. However, given the role of the DCR in an underlying proneness to injury, we suggest that a more comprehensive study with a substantial follow-up period is undertaken for uncovering the potential importance of this ratio vis-a-vis other major functional parameters as well as injury prediction and assessment of rehabilitation.

CP  - 14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)
AB  - Most of existing works on the tubes design optimization of concentric-tube robot (CTR) do not include the elastic stability in the optimization criteria. The only work which formulates the elastic stability in the objective function is based on scalarization method which is used in existing multi-objective design optimization. The objective function is formed by a set of weighted objective functions. The selection of the weights is crucial as the optimization results are greatly affected by them and could be misleading if these weights are improperly chosen. As an alternative optimization technique, we use Pareto grid-searching method to avoid this problem and allow a straightforward interpretation of the results following the selection criteria for the parameters to be optimized. This paper shows a three-tube CTR design based on Pareto grid-searching method in order to optimize the reachability and elastic stability of the CTR within a specific curvature range dedicated to the deep anterior brain tumor removal surgery.

AB  - Concentric coils are used in domestic induction heating system to improve the range of cookware sizes suitable to be heated up because the coils are switched on or switched off depending on the degree of their covering by the pot. The power is supplied by power converters, typically single-switch or half-bridge inverters, feeding the coils with a medium frequency current. However, the switching frequencies of the inverters connected to the coils has to be equal due to the coupling between the coils implies intermodulation noise which must be avoided in order to achieve a user-friendly product. The preceding switching frequency constraint limits the flexibility in the selection of the power delivered to each load. Phase-Shift Modulation has been proposed to overcome in part this drawback, but, in this work, the complimentary Asymmetric Duty Cycle Control has been also included in the modulation in order to enhance the power sharing between the loads. The proposed modulation scheme is analyzed in this paper, and its benefits and feasibility are tested experimentally using domestic induction heating inverter prototype.

AB  - When a plate is subjected to applied loads and significant out-of-plane deformation, the demand on the connection may exceed that derived from calculations due to the applied loads only. Where inelastic behavior is acceptable, the intent may be to ensure ductile behavior. For plates with fillet-welded edge connections, this can be accomplished by sizing the fillet welds to develop the strength of the plate.
   One specific example of this arises when a brace in a special concentrically braced frame (SCBF) is subject to compression and buckles out-of-plane. Bending of the gusset plate may demand more of the gusset plate edge connection than the calculated forces that result on the gusset edge due to the brace force specified in Section F2.6c.2 of AISC 341-16 (AISC, 2016). If not accounted for in the weld size, the uncalculated weak-axis moment on the welds from out-of-plane bending of the gusset plate might cause rupture of the fillet welds to govern the behavior of the system.
   The method provided in this paper is suitable to determine the minimum size of fillet welds necessary to prevent weld rupture as out-of-plane deformations occur. It can be used for fillet-welded gusset plate edges in SCBFs to satisfy the exception provided in Section F2.6c.4 of AISC 341-16.

AB  - Objectives: previous studies investigating the ability of isokinetic strength ratios to predict hamstring injuries in soccer players have reported conflicting results.
   Hypothesis: to determine if isokinetic ratios are able to predict hamstring injury occurring during the season in professional soccer players.
   Study Design: case-control study; Level of evidence: 3.
   Methods: from 2001 to 2011, 350 isokinetic tests were performed in 136 professional soccer players at the beginning of the soccer season. Fifty-seven players suffered hamstring injury during the season that followed the isokinetic tests. These players were compared with the 79 uninjured players. The bilateral concentric ratio (hamstring-to-hamstring), ipsilateral concentric ratio (hamstring-to-quadriceps), and mixed ratio (eccentric/concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) were studied. The predictive ability of each ratio was established based on the likelihood ratio and post-test probability.
   Results: the mixed ratio (30 eccentric/240 concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) <0.8, ipsilateral ratio (180 concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) <0.47, and bilateral ratio (60 concentric hamstring-to-hamstring) <0.85 were the most predictive of hamstring injury. The ipsilateral ratio <0.47 allowed prediction of the severity of the hamstring injury, and was also influenced by the length of time since administration of the isokinetic tests.
   Conclusion: isokinetic ratios are useful for predicting the likelihood of hamstring injury in professional soccer players during the competitive season.

AB  - The low oil prices have produced severe impact on the offshore industry slowing down new projects. The projects to become economically feasible shall incorporate innovative solutions for subsea equipment. In this context, the use of sandwich pipes for deepwater scenarios can be a useful alternative to conventional long distance pipelines. Sandwich pipe is a new concept composed of two concentric steel pipes separated by and bonded to a cement annulus that provides a combination of high structural strength with thermal insulation. For ultra deepwater scenarios, related to water depths beyond 1,500 m, the single wall steel pipe requires very thick wall and high insulation capacity. In this work, structural configurations for single wall pipe (SW), pipe-in-pipe (PIP) and sandwich pipe (SP) are designed for several deepwater scenarios. Collapse and buckling propagation are considered to overcome the high pressure environment while flow assurance is considered to overcome the low temperature Simulations on flow assurance and cost evaluation will provide the basis for the comparative studies and recommendation about the appropriate scenarios for sandwich pipe applications. Flow assurance was simulated with OLGA software for the considered scenarios to avoid solid deposition. The costs related to each pipeline technology are finally compared for the established scenarios, and the sandwich pipe was considered to be a promising technology when high collapse strength and good thermal insulation are required.

AB  - An approach for automatically correcting the eccentricity of the die to the punch with a moving die in small clearance punching of die-quenched steel sheets having low ductility was developed to improve the quality of the sheared edge and tool life. Although small clearance punching has the advantage of high quality of sheared edges for high strength steel sheets, it is not easy to set the die and punch for the small clearance concentrically. This brings about deterioration of the quality of the sheared edges and failure of the tools. In automatic centring, the position of the moving die is corrected by an imbalanced force during punching. It was found that small clearance punching with automatic centring is effective for not only the improvement of surface quality of the sheared edge but also the prevention of tool failure and delayed fracture in cold punching of die-quenched steel sheets having 1500 MPa in tensile strength.

AB  - A novel, compact, multiple band notch filter (MBNF) is presented. Contiguous and concentric split ring resonators (SRRs) and ring resonator are used to achieve desired multiple narrow band notches. These band notches have been designed to avoid the undesired interference between co-existing wireless channels. Proposed filter is implemented on RT/Duroid 5880 (epsilon(r)=2.2) substrate of thickness 0.785 mm and surface area of 14 x 14 sq. mm. Insertion loss of the proposed filter at notch bands is high (>13 dB) and low (<0.8 dB) elsewhere. Measured results are correlated with simulated results and ensure proposed filter is a suitable candidate to mitigate interference caused by the co-existing and emerging wireless technologies.

AB  - In the present work, combustion instabilities of a modular combustor are investigated. The combustor operates with partially premixed, swirl-stabilized flames and can be operated in single- and different multiple-burner setups. The design parameters of the combustor prevent large-scale flame-flame interactions in the multiple-burner arrangements. The objective is to investigate how the interaction of the swirl jets affects the thermoacoustic stability of the combustor. Results of measurements of pressure oscillations and high-speed OH*-chemiluminescence imaging for the single-burner setup and two multiple-burner setups are discussed. Additionally, results of investigations with different flame characteristics are presented. These are achieved by varying the ratio of the mass flow rates through the swirlers of the double-concentric swirl nozzle. Several unstable modes with high pressure amplitudes are observed in the single-burner setup as well as in the multiple-burner setups. Numerical studies of the acoustic behavior of the combustor setups were performed that indicate that the different geometries show similar acoustic behaviors. The results lead to the conclusion that the interaction of the swirl jets in the multiple-burner setups affects the thermoacoustic response spectrum of the flame even in the absence of large-scale flame-flame interactions. Based on the findings in earlier studies, it is concluded that the differences in the flame response characteristics are induced by the reduction of the swirl intensity in the multiple-burner arrangements, which is caused by the exchange of momentum between the adjacent swirl jets.

KW  - ALGORITHM
AB  - The integrated fan-out (InFO) wafer-level chip-scale package (WLCSP) is an emerging packaging technology, which typically consists of multiple redistribution layers (RDLs) for signal redis-tributions among multiple chips. There is still no published work specifically on the RDL routing for the InFO WLCSP. Published RDL routing works consider different types of routing, namely free-assignment, pre-assignment, and unified-assignment routing, for a single chip. With the integration of multiple chips under the InFO WLCSP, however, previous works cannot achieve high efficiency or effectiveness with simple extensions. To remedy the deficiencies of poor interactions between chips and multiple RDLs, we formulate a new RDL routing problem for the InFO WLCSP and present the first work in the literature to handle the unified-assignment, multi-layer multi-chip RDL routing problem (without RDL vias), considering signal integrity, layer assignment, layer number minimization, and total wirelength minimization. We propose a concentric-circle model which models all the connections among one chip and all other chips. Based on this model, we assign the connections between chips to appropriate layers to avoid long detours. In addition, this model transforms the geometrical information of the pre-assignment connections among chips into a network-flow model to generate a routing prototype in a fan-out region not covered by any chip efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and efficiency of our algorithm.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare real-time values of power and work obtained through BlueBrain (TM) and SmartCoach (TM) systems during flywheel leg press exercise using different inertias (loads). Eight sets of seven repetitions were performed at variable and maximum intensity for each inertia used (i.e. 0.0125; 0.025; 0.0375; 0.05; 0.0625 and 0.075 kg*m(2)), with 2 minutes recovery between sets. Average power during concentric actions and total work (concentric-eccentric) were measured simultaneously using both systems. Data were analysed using a linear regression analysis and correlation procedures. Strong significant correlations were observed in average power results between both data acquisition systems for all individual inertias and intensities evaluated, as well as for overall data (r=.968; Sig.(2-tailed)=.000; R-2=.937). In addition, work values showed clear significant correlations (r=.978; Sig.(2-tailed)=.000; R-2=.957). Differences between devices oscillated over a range of 2.6-4.3%. The strong correlations found in power and work values seem to indicate that both data acquisition systems are similar and valid to estimate power and work during resistance exercises employing flywheel inertial technology. Thus, both devices may represent a helpful tool to control and follow up training using flywheel technology.

AB  - This paper presents a high gain antenna with a nearly unidirectional radiation pattern. The antenna is composed of concentric complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) that radiate at different frequencies as determined by the circumference of each ring slot as well as the mutual coupling between them. The antenna is optimized for operation at 2.45 GHz, which is one of the frequencies commonly used for body worn communication devices. It is found that the concentric CSRRs behave like a filter in the radial direction and prevent surface currents from reaching the edges of the ground plane resulting in broadside radiation. The antenna shows a return loss of higher than 25 dB in both measurement and simulation. The front-to-back ratio (FTBR) is improved by backing the ring slots with a metallic rectangular cavity yielding FTBR of 21.2 dB and gain of 7.87 dB in measurements. The achieved radiation characteristics prove that the designed antenna is a good potential candidate for body-worn communication devices, where human body exposure to radiation must be minimal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform both space and space-time evaluations of visceral leishmaniasis in humans in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   METHODS: The population considered in the study comprised autochthonous cases of visceral leishmaniasis and deaths resulting from it in Sao Paulo, between 1999 and 2013. The analysis considered the western region of the state as its studied area. Thematic maps were created to show visceral leishmaniasis dissemination in humans in the municipality. Spatial analysis tools Kernel and Kernel ratio were used to respectively obtain the distribution of cases and deaths and the distribution of incidence and mortality. Scan statistics were used in order to identify spatial and space-time clusters of cases and deaths.
   RESULTS: The visceral leishmaniasis cases in humans, during the studied period, were observed to occur in the western portion of Sao Paulo, and their territorial extension mainly followed the eastbound course of the Marechal Rondon highway. The incidences were characterized as two sequences of concentric ellipses of decreasing intensities. The first and more intense one was found to have its epicenter in the municipality of Castilho (where the Marechal Rondon highway crosses the border of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul) and the second one in Bauru. Mortality was found to have a similar behavior to incidence. The spatial and space-time clusters of cases were observed to coincide with the two areas of highest incidence. Both the space-time clusters identified, even without coinciding in time, were started three years after the human cases were detected and had the same duration, that is, six years.
   CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of visceral leishmaniasis in Sao Paulo has been taking place in an eastbound direction, focusing on the role of highways, especially Marechal Rondon, in this process. The space-time analysis detected the disease occurred in cycles, in different spaces and time periods. These meetings, if considered, may contribute to the adoption of actions that aim to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the whole territory of Sao Paulo or to at least reducing its expansion speed.

AB  - The aim of our investigation was to determine the ratio of maximal torque values and the torques in the certain positions of range of movements (ROM) between hamstring (H) and quadriceps femoris (Q) muscles at medium and high velocity of movementin concentric (CC) and eccentric (ECC) action of hamstring muscles.
   The knee muscles of 15 amateur female short and middle distance runners were tested by the dynamometer system in the isokinetic movements with the angular velocity of 90 degrees/s and 240 degrees/s in CC and at the velocity of 90 degrees/s in ECC H/CC Qmuscles contractions. The torque values produced by the muscles are detected at the different angular positions of the ROM with the step of 10 degrees. The ratios of H/Q muscles torques are calculated.
   The H/Q muscles maximal torques ratio is 0.51 +/- 0.13 at the velocity of 90 degrees/s in CC and 0.60 +/- 0.09 in ECCH/CC Q muscles contractions, and 0.59 +/- 0.09 CC at the velocity of 240 degrees/s. The H/Q maximal torques ratio and this ratio in the knee extreme extension and flexion at the ECC contraction of His higher due to greater torques produced by the H in comparison with Q muscle. The H must be stronger to decelerate the thigh and lower leg extension in the late swing phase of running and to extend the hip in early stance phase to provide powerful sprint running and prevent the knee and Hinjury. The H/Q muscles torques ratio in extended knee positions are similar in medium (90 degrees/s) and fast (240 degrees/s) velocity of motions because CC action of H muscles cannot prevent extreme knee extension.

AB  - A dual band sleeve dipole antenna for WLAN application is presented. The antenna covers both the WLAN bands. The proposed antenna exhibits excellent omni-directional characteristics and reflection properties S11 values which are less than - 10db. The dipole is constructed from two concentric hallow cylinders having different radius and different lengths. The complicated balun network is avoided by feeding the antenna at the center with the help of coaxial cable. The scattering parameters and radiation patterns are simulated using CST microwave studio. These simulation results are validated by the measured results. The antenna is best suitable for airborne and outdoor applications.

AB  - In this paper, 3D concentric triple cylinder FSS with stable performance is proposed to control GSM (900 MHz), UMTS (1800 MHz), 4G (2.3 GHz) communication, which is highly in demand to isolate or control the human being from the microwave polluted environment. The challenge is to develop such a structure which can control all the communication band simultaneously also provide the isolation mutually to prevent crosstalk with stable response to the angularly incident EM wave. The designed 3D FSS structure should easily be fabricated and must have good mechanical strength. Unit cell of 3D concentric triple cylinder FSS consist of three concentric cylinders. Parameter for the final design of concentric triple 3D cylinder FSS has been chosen after performing regress parametric analysis using CST software. Simulation of proposed FSS shows the narrowband characteristics, which owes its advantages to high selectivity. Concentric triple cylinder 3D FSS also insensitive to the angularly incident EM wave up to 900, which shows stable performance with incident angles and different polarizations.

AB  - The effects of daily repeated bouts of concentric, isometric, or eccentric contractions induced by high frequency (kilohertz) transcutaneous electrical stimulation in ameliorating atrophy of the soleus muscle in hindlimb unloaded rats were determined. Five groups of male rats were studied: control, hindlimb unloaded for 2 weeks (HU), or HU plus two daily bouts of concentric, isometric, or eccentric high frequency electrical stimulation-induced contractions of the calf musculature. Soleus mass and fiber size were smaller, the levels of phosphorylated Akt1 and FoxO3a lower, and atrogin-1 and ubiquitinated proteins higher in the HU, and the HU plus concentric or isometric contraction groups than in the control group. In contrast, daily bouts of eccentric contractions maintained these values at near control levels and all measures were significantly different from all other HU groups. These results indicate that daily bouts of eccentric contractions induced by high-frequency stimulation inhibited the ubiquitin-proteasome catabolic pathway and enhanced the Akt1/FoxO3a anabolic pathway that resulted in a prevention of the atrophic response of the soleus muscle to chronic unloading.

AB  - Hamstring strain injuries are the predominant injury in many sports, costing athletes and clubs a significant financial and performance burden; therefore, the ability to identify and intervene with individuals who are considered at high risk of injury is important. One measure that has grown in popularity as an outcome variable following hamstring intervention/prevention studies and rehabilitation is the angle of peak knee flexor torque. This current opinion article will firstly introduce the measure and the processes behind it. Second, the article will summarise how the angle of peak knee flexor torque has been suggested to measure hamstring strain injury risk. Finally, the numerous limitations will be presented and the article will outline how these limitations may influence the usefulness of the angle of peak knee flexor torque measure. These include the lack of muscle specificity, the common concentric contraction mode of assessment, reliability of the measure, various neural contributions (such as rate of force development and neuromuscular inhibition), as well as the lack of prospective data showing any predictive value in the measure.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to outline a multilevel modeling approach to fit individual angle-specific torque curves describing concentric knee extension and flexion isokinetic muscular actions in Master athletes. The potential of the analytical approach to examine between individual differences across the angle-specific torque curves was illustrated including between-individuals variation due to gender differences at a higher level. Torques in concentric muscular actions of knee extension and knee extension at 60 degrees.s(-1) were considered within a range of motion between 5 degrees and 85 degrees (only torques "truly" isokinetic). Multilevel time series models with autoregressive covariance structures with standard multilevel models were superior fits compared with standard multilevel models for repeated measures to fit anglespecific torque curves. Third and fourth order polynomial models were the best fits to describe angle-specific torque curves of isokinetic knee flexion and extension concentric actions, respectively. The fixed exponents allow interpretations for initial acceleration, the angle at peak torque and the decrement of torque after peak torque. Also, the multilevel models were flexible to illustrate the influence of gender differences on the shape of torque throughout the range of motion and in the shape of the curves. The presented multilevel regression models may afford a general framework to examine angle-specific moment curves by isokinetic dynamometry, and add to the understanding mechanisms of strength development, particularly the force-length relationship, both related to performance and injury prevention.

AB  - Background. Blocking leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 in organ transplant recipients prolongs allograft survival. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of LFA-1 blockade in preventing chronic rejection are not fully elucidated. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the preeminent cause of late cardiac allograft failure characterized histologically by concentric intimal hyperplasia. Methods. Anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody was used in a multiple minor antigenmismatched, BALB.B (H-2 degrees) to C57BL/6 (H-2 degrees), cardiac allograft model. Endogenous donor-specific CD8 T cells were tracked down using major histocompatibility complex multimers against the immunodominant H4, H7, H13, H28, and H60 minor Ags. Results. The LFA-1 blockade prevented acute rejection and preserved palpable beating quality with reduced CD8 T-cell graft infiltration. Interestingly, less CD8 T cell infiltration was secondary to reduction of T-cell expansion rather than less trafficking. The LFA-1 blockade significantly suppressed the clonal expansion of minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CD8 T cells during the expansion and contraction phase. The CAV development was evaluated with morphometric analysis at postoperation day 100. The LFA-1 blockade profoundly attenuated neointimal hyperplasia (61.6 vs 23.8%; P < 0.05), CAV-affected vessel number (55.3 vs 15.9%; P < 0.05), and myocardial fibrosis (grade 3.29 vs 1.8; P < 0.05). Finally, short-term LFA-1 blockade promoted long-term donor-specific regulation, which resulted in attenuated transplant arteriosclerosis. Conclusions. Taken together, LFA-1 blockade inhibits initial endogenous alloreactive T-cell expansion and induces more regulation. Such a mechanism supports a pulse tolerance induction strategy with anti-LFA-1 rather than long-term treatment.

In this paper, stepwise design procedure of Performance Based Plastic Design of Concentrically Braced frame attuned with the Indian Standard code has been presented. The comparative seismic performance evaluation of a six storey concentrically braced frame designed using the displacement based Performance Based Plastic Design (PBPD) method and currently used force based Limit State Design (LSD) method has also been carried out by nonlinear static pushover analysis and time history analysis under three different ground motions. Results show that Performance Based Plastic Design method is superior to the current design in terms of displacement and acceleration response. Also total collapse of the frame is prevented in the PBPD frame.

AB  - Previous studies have utilized screening values of 10-15% of lower-extremity side-to-side strength asymmetry in soccer players with conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in screening values for side-to-side asymmetry in soccer players according to their playing position, as well as to compare the differences in strength asymmetry between particular playing positions. Seventy-nine Brazilian male professional soccer players (age 26.1 +/- 5.3 years; body mass 79.8 +/- 14.4 kg; body height 180.4 +/- 12.9 cm) were grouped into playing positions of: goalkeepers, side backs, central backs, central defending midfielders, central attacking midfielders, and forwards. They performed maximal knee extension and flexion concentric and knee flexion eccentric actions on their preferred and non-preferred legs at 1.047 rad.s(-1). Forwards and goalkeepers had hamstrings concentric peak torque asymmetry (18.0 +/- 9.9%) and eccentric peak torque asymmetry (20.1 +/- 10.7%) significantly greater than 10% (p<.05). All other playing positions had values less than 15%. Our results indicate that the use of either 10 or 15% asymmetry cut off may result in different conclusions, which may affect decision-making regarding strength ratios. Furthermore, if 10% is used as a screening value, hamstrings strengthening programs based on bilateral equivalency should be prescribed for goalkeepers and forwards to reduce asymmetry.

AB  - We here investigate the geometry, age, and history of several enigmatic northern Thailand earthwork entrenchments that are mostly located on hills and could not have held water to form moats. The earthworks are either oval or rectangular in plan view and typically encircle 0.3 to 1 sq km areas with no potsherd debris that would indicate former towns. Most trenches are 3-5 m deep with inner walls 4.5-8 m high. Some encircling earthworks are concentric double trenches spaced approximately 10 m apart. Historians have suggested these earthworks enclosed defensible areas where people in outlying villages sought refuge when under attack by neighboring rulers, the Chinese Ho, or the Burmese. We argue that some encircling entrenchments may have been for the capture or containment of elephants. Nearly all of the once near-vertical original walls have degraded to slopes of 32-47 degrees. Fitting calculated curves of the diffusion-based scarp-degradation model to our height-slope data, and assuming most scarps have degraded since the end of La Na Kingdom time A. D. 1558, we derive a diffusion coefficient of 0.002 m(2) y(-1). Slopes of the rectangular earthwork at Souvannkhomkham, Laos, across the Mekong River from Chiang Saen Noi, are significantly more degraded (approximately 32 degrees), indicating an age of 800-1200 years. Locations of these earthworks are established in hope that they will be preserved as part of the Thai and Lao archaeological legacy.

AB  - Uncoupling of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) has been implicated in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and dilatory remodeling induced by pressure overload. We investigated whether administration of sepiapterin, a substrate of the salvage pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, prevents LVH and dilatory LV remodeling by inhibiting NOS uncoupling and increasing bioavailable NO. Pressure overload was induced in rats by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Concentric LVH developed during 8 wk after TAC, and dilatory LV remodeling and dysfunction developed between 8 and 16 wk after TAC associated with a decrease in capillary density. Oral administration of sepiapterin or the superoxide/peroxynitrite scavenger N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine for 8 wk after TAC inhibited oxidative stress, but only sepiapterin increased bioavailable NO and inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with a further increase in capillary density. When sepiapterin was administered between 8 and 16 wk after TAC, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was regressed and capillary density was restored. This was associated with the inhibition of interstitial fibrosis and dilatory LV remodeling. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abrogated all the beneficial effects of sepiapterin in rats with TAC. These results suggest that sepiapterin prevents concentric LVH and dilatory remodeling after TAC primarily by increasing the bioavailability of NO.

AB  - This article reports an experimental and numerical study on the orientation effect for a radial heat sink with a circular base, concentric ring, and rectangular fins. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of orientation angle with respect to gravity, various geometric parameters (fin number, fin length, fin height, and height of the base), Elenbaas number, on Nusselt number. The results show that the influences of fin number and fins length on the orientation effect are significant, whereas the fin height and base height are slightly insignificant. From the numerical and experimental results, it is shown that the horizontally oriented radial heat sinks have better thermal performance than vertically oriented radial heat sink due to the existence of the concentric ring preventing the natural convective upward flow. The present numerical model is shown to predict the experimental results well within error of 4%. Finally, a closed-form correlation for predicting Nusselt number with heat sink design parameters is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exercise training (Ex) has been recommended for its beneficial effects in hypertensive states. The present study evaluated the time-course effects of Ex without workload on mean arterial pressure (MAP), reflex bradycardia, cardiac and renal histology, and oxidative stress in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats. Male Fischer rats (10 weeks old; 150-180 g) underwent surgery (2K1C or SHAM) and were subsequently divided into a sedentary (SED) group and Ex group (swimming 1 h/day, 5 days/week for 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 weeks). Until week 4, Ex decreased MAP, increased reflex bradycardia, prevented concentric hypertrophy, reduced collagen deposition in the myocardium and kidneys, decreased the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the left ventricle, and increased the catalase (CAT) activity in the left ventricle and both kidneys. From week 6 to week 10, however, MAP and reflex bradycardia in 2K1C Ex rats became similar to those in 2K1C SED rats. Ex effectively reduced heart rate and prevented collagen deposition in the heart and both kidneys up to week 10, and restored the level of TBARS in the left ventricle and clipped kidney and the CAT activity in both kidneys until week 8. Ex without workload for 10 weeks in 2K1C rats provided distinct beneficial effects. The early effects of Ex on cardiovascular function included reversing MAP and reflex bradycardia. The later effects of Ex included preventing structural alterations in the heart and kidney by decreasing oxidative stress and reducing injuries in these organs during hypertension.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anti-swarming potential of Pelargonium graveolens essential oil against the Proteus isolate. Materials and methods: The effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of Pelargonium graveolens essential oil and aroma-chemicals was studied on swarming differentiation of urinary Proteus mirabilis isolate. The parameters under study were number of concentric rings and diameter of swarm fronts. Results and Discussion: The concentrations of P. graveolens essential oil ranging from 1.12-8.96 mg/ml showed a pronounced reduction in the diameter of the colony as a function of time. Evident reduction in the number of concentric rings was also observed due to the incorporation of P. graveolens essential oil at 8.96 mg/ml and 4.48 mg/ml concentrations. Conclusion: Hence, the inhibition of swarming by P. graveolens essential oil suggests its potential to be developed as a product for preventing P. mirabilis infections.

AB  - A fossil of the aerophytic green algal genus Phycopeltis (Trentepohliaes, Ulvophyceae) dated to 35 Ma, is reported from the Pikopiko Fossil Forest, Southland, New Zealand. Previous reports of fossilized Phycopeltis have been subsequently synonymized with fungi by other authors; however, our specimen is not vulnerable to their criticisms. Inflated cells present in two approximately concentric rings are interpreted as gametangia, with irregular structures resembling the gametangial pores of modern material; sporophytic material is absent. The fossil resembles the modern discforming species P. novae-zelandiae, P. expansa, and P. arundinacea. The limited material available prevents the assignation of a specific epithet, but the habit and dimensions of the fossil clearly fall within those of modern representatives of the genus. Its single cell thickness throughout, absence of distinct melanization, and larger size demonstrate that it is not a fungal shield. The specimen constitutes arguably the most convincing fossil belonging to Trentepohliales, and the first unambiguously for the genus Phycopeltis. It is consistent in age with other known fossils of the order that, when combined with molecular evidence, suggests a terrestrial radiation far more recent than that of land plants.

AB  - Introduction Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), strength is a key variable in regaining full function of the knee. Isokinetic strength is commonly used as part of the return to sport (RTS) criteria.
   Aim We systematically reviewed the isokinetic strength evaluation protocols that are currently being used following ACLR. A secondary aim was to suggest an isokinetic protocol that could meet RTS criteria.
   Method Articles were searched using ScienceDirect, PubMed and Sage Journals Online, combined with crosschecked reference lists of the publications. Protocol data and outcome measurements and RTS criteria were extracted from each article included in the review.
   Results 39 studies met the inclusion criteria and reported their isokinetic strength evaluation protocol following ACLR. The variables that were most commonly used were concentric/concentric mode of contraction (31 studies), angular velocity of 60 degrees/s (29 studies), 3-5 repetitions (24 studies), range of motion of 0-90 degrees (6 studies), and using gravity correction (9 studies). 8 studies reported strength limb symmetry index scores as part of their RTS criteria.
   Conclusions There was no standardised isokinetic protocol following ACLR; isokinetic strength measures have not been validated as useful predictors of successful RTS. We propose a standard protocol to allow consistency of testing and accurate comparison of future research.

AB  - Hypertension induced hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and is associated with cardiac oxidation and reduced NO production. We hypothesized that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) can regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway and reverse cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Ten-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into five groups, WKY, WKY + BH4, SHR, SHR + BH4 and SHR + VAL In SHR, diastolic dysfunction was accompanied by concentric hypertrophy, cardiac oxidation, and reduced cardiac BH4 and NO production. Four-week BH4 and valsartan administration reversed hypertrophy and improved diastolic function. BH4 and valsartan blunted the expression of hypertrophy markers a-skeletal actin (alpha-SA) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC). Only BH4 reduced hypertension and induced myocardial fibrosis and expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). BH4 reduced cardiac oxidant stress and increased NO production. Exogenous BH4 increased phosphorylated Akt levels and increased Bcl-2 expression.
   In conclusion, less BH4 and reduced NO increases myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac oxidative stress, which exacerbates diastolic dysfunction. Exogenous BH4 ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction through the PI3K/p-Akt pathway. BH4 may be a potent therapy for hypertension with diastolic dysfunction. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Degradation and fouling of support structures in nuclear steam generators (SGs) can lead to SG tube damage and loss of SG efficiency. Inspection and monitoring of support structures combined with preventative maintenance programs can alleviate these effects and extend SG life. Conventional eddy current inspection technologies are extensively used for detecting and sizing indications from wall loss, frets at supports, cracks and other degradation modes in the tubes, as well as assessing the condition of support structures. However, these methods have limited capabilities when more than one degradation mode is present simultaneously, or when combined with fouling. Pulsed eddy current combined with principal components analysis (PCA) was examined for inspection of 15.9 mm (5/8") Alloy-800 tubes and surrounding stainless steel (SS410) support structures. Clear separation of PCA scores associated with tubes from those associated with ferromagnetic SS410 supports permitted measurement of tube-to-support gaps, in either the presence of tube fretting or variation of relative position of the tube within SS410 supports. For concentric tubes, frets could be sized independently of SS410 hole diameter variations, which in other materials could represent support corrosion. Capability to clearly separate scores was attributed to large differences in relaxation times for diffusion of transient fields through the tube compared with diffusion into the ferromagnetic support structure.

AB  - The article discusses evolutionary aspects of mimicry from a semiotic viewpoint. The concept of semiotic scaffolding is used for this approach, and its relations with the concepts of exaptation and semiotic co-option are explained. Different dimensions of scaffolding are brought out as ontogenetic, evolutionary, physiological and cognitive. These dimensions allow for interpreting mimicry as a system that scaffolds itself. With the help of a number of mimicry cases, e.g. butterfly eyespots, brood parasitism, and plant mimesis, the evolutionary dynamics of mimicry in the open bio-semiosphere is investigated. The main argument is that biological mimicry largely develops through sign relations and communicative relations between organisms. It is proposed that mimicry systems should be described as two-layered structures composed of the ecological composition of the species involved and the semiotic structure of their communication.

   Methods Laboratory study of capsular biomechanics and literature review of histology and published clinical results.
   Results Parameters of ideal capsulotomy construction include complete overlap of the intraocular lens to prevent PCO, centration on the clinical approximation of the optical axis of the lens to ensure concentricity with the capsule equator, and maximal capsular thickness at the capsulotomy edge to maintain integrity.
   Conclusions Constructing the capsulotomy centred on the clinical approximation of the optical axis of the lens with diameter 5.25 mm optimises prevention of PCO, consistency of ELP and capsular strength.

AB  - Transplant vasculopathy (TV) represents the main cause of late graft failure and limits the long-term success of organ transplantation. Cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of the concentric and diffuse intimal hyperplasia of arteries of the grafted organ. We recently reported that the mitogenic signaling, evoked in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hmSMC) by the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, implicates neutral sphingomyelinase-2, suggesting a role for sphingolipids in intimal hyperplasia of TV. Here, we investigated whether the mitogenic sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is involved in intimal hyperplasia elicited by W6/32. Studies were done on cultured hmSMC and on an in vivo model of TV, consisting of human mesenteric arteries grafted into SCID/beige mice, injected weekly with W6/32. hmSMC migration and DNA synthesis elicited by W6/32 were inhibited by the sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) inhibitor dimethylsphingosine, the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab and the S1PR1/R3 inhibitor VPC23019. W6/32 stimulated SK1 activity, while siRNA silencing SK1, S1PR1 and S1PR3 inhibited hmSMC migration. In vivo, Sphingomab significantly reduced the intimal thickening induced by W6/32. These data emphasize the role of S1P in intimal hyperplasia elicited by the humoral immune response, and open perspectives for preventing TV with S1P inhibitors.

AB  - This study focuses on sedimentary structures formed by microbial consortia, in a particular coastal setting, an ancient tidal channel, separated from the ocean by a sandy spit and connected by a blind tidal channel at the opposite end. Most studies in modern and ancient environments consider water movement as the triggering mechanism acting in the formation and deformation of sedimentary structures. As such, the paper documents the presence of several microbial structures such as shrinkage cracks, flip-over mats, microbial chips, and multidirectional ripples which are related to tidal processes, while bulges and gas domes structures are formed after occasional inundation events. However, the more conspicuous structures covering a great area at the study site are folds and roll-ups, the product of deformation of microbially induced structures by the action of sporadic spring-tidal currents due to strong winds. Therefore, the objective of this research is to document modern sedimentary structures in a coastal area and to provide a mechanistic explanation for their formation, based on the interplaying effects of the moisture variation and high shear stress. Also, several microbial sedimentary structures are distinguished throughout vertical sediment cores, such as microbial chips, detached mat, sponge fabrics, tears, and concentric structures, which are identified in a sedimentary profile. Through the recognition and interpretation of modern sedimentary deformation structures, this study contributes empirical tools for the reconstruction of analogous paleoenvironments in fossil studies.

AB  - In this paper, the authors propose a block-based reversible watermarking method for 2D vector map authentication. In the scheme, they divide the features of a vector map into different categories of blocks, calculate an authentication watermark for each block, and embed the watermarks of different blocks using a reversible watermarking method based on virtual coordinates and a fragile watermarking algorithm based on concentric circles. While the block division ensures superior accuracy of tamper localization, the two watermarking methods provide recovery of the original content. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good invisibility, reversibility and computational complexity, and can accurately locate malicious attacks such as vertex modification/addition/deletion and feature modification/addition/deletion.

AB  - The nymphalid groundplan has been proposed to explain diverse butterfly wing color patterns. In this model, each symmetry system is composed of a core element and a pair of paracore elements. The development of this elemental configuration has been explained by the induction model for positional information. However, the diversity of color patterns in other butterfly families in relation to the nymphalid groundplan has not been thoroughly examined. Here, we examined aberrant color pattern phenotypes of a lycaenid butterfly, Zizeeria maha, from mutagenesis and plasticity studies as well as from field surveys. In several mutants, the third and fourth spot arrays were coordinately positioned much closer to the discal spot in comparison to the normal phenotype. In temperature-shock types, the third and fourth array spots were elongated inwardly or outwardly from their normal positions. In field-caught spontaneous mutants, small black spots were located adjacent to normal black spots. Analysis of these aberrant phenotypes indicated that the spots belonging to the third and fourth arrays are synchronously changeable in position and shape around the discal spot. Thus, these arrays constitute paracore elements of the central symmetry system of the lycaenid butterflies, and the discal spot comprises the core element. These aberrant phenotypes can be explained by the black-inducing signals that propagate from the prospective discal spot, as predicted by the induction model. These results suggest the existence of long-range developmental signals that cover a large area of a wing not only in nymphalid butterflies, but also in lycaenid butterflies.

AB  - Due to a high incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) re-injury in alpine ski racers, this study aims to assess functional asymmetry in the countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), and leg muscle mass in elite ski racers with and without anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Elite alpine skiers with ACL-R (n=9; 26.2 +/- 11.8 months post-op) and uninjured skiers (n=9) participated in neuromuscular screening. Vertical ground reaction force during the CMJ and SJ was assessed using dual force plate methodology to obtain phase-specific bilateral asymmetry indices (AIs) for kinetic impulse (CMJ and SJ phase-specific kinetic impulse AI). Dual x-ray absorptiometry scanning was used to assess asymmetry in lower body muscle mass. Compared with controls, ACL-R skiers had increased AI in muscle mass (P<0.001), kinetic impulse AI in the CMJ concentric phase (P<0.05), and the final phase of the SJ (P<0.05). Positive associations were observed between muscle mass and AI in the CMJ concentric phase (r=0.57, P<0.01) as well as in the late SJ phase (r=0.66, P<0.01). Future research is required to assess the role of the CMJ and SJ phase-specific kinetic impulse AI as a part of a multifaceted approach for improving outcome following ACL-R in elite ski racers.

AB  - Background: Flexibility helps with injury prevention, the reduction of soreness following a workout, and a general sense of well-being. There are different stretching techniques and protocols for improvements in calf extensibility and flexibility. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of two techniques i.e. CYCLIC and PNF stretching which improves calf flexibility. This study was done to find the effectiveness of calf Cyclic and PNF stretching technique to improve calf flexibility.
   Methods: 30 subjects with age group 21-22 years were randomly allocated to 2 groups equally. Group 1(n=15) were given CYCLIC and group 2(n=15) were given PNF stretching technique. Plantar flexion was used to measure the calf tightness which was done before and after the treatment. Treatment was given for 7 days and on the 7th day the calf tightness was again measured.
   Results: The mean difference of the CYCLIC is 4.6 and mean difference of PNF is 4.7 which indicate that CYCLIC and PNF both are effective to improve calf flexibility but PNF is more effective than CYCLIC to improve calf flexibility.
   Conclusion: The neurophysiological basis of PNF, stating that the excitatory efficient of the neuromuscular spindle or the inhibitory afferent of the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) or both are responsible for the effects. During PNF stretch and isometric contraction of stretched agonists for extended period may cause activation of its neuromuscular spindle. The increase in tension created during the isometric contraction of the pre -lengthened agonist contracts concentrically. Both the fascia & the spindle of the agonist adjust to the nearly lengthened position. These impulses travel via causing post synaptic inhibition of the motor neuron to agonist increasing the tension from the GTO. These impulses can override the impulses coming from the neuromuscular spindles arousing the muscle to reflexly resist to the change in length, thus helping in lengthening the muscle. PNF stretching is more effective than cyclic stretching.

AB  - We present the design of a concentric tube (CT) reactor for roll-to-roll chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on flexible substrates, and its application to continuous production of graphene on copper foil. In the CTCVD reactor, the thin foil substrate is helically wrapped around the inner tube, and translates through the gap between the concentric tubes. We use a bench-scale prototype machine to synthesize graphene on copper substrates at translation speeds varying from 25 mm/min to 500 mm/min, and investigate the influence of process parameters on the uniformity and coverage of graphene on a continuously moving foil. At lower speeds, high-quality monolayer graphene is formed; at higher speeds, rapid nucleation of small graphene domains is observed, yet coalescence is prevented by the limited residence time in the CTCVD system. We show that a smooth isothermal transition between the reducing and carbon-containing atmospheres, enabled by injection of the carbon feedstock via radial holes in the inner tube, is essential to high-quality roll-to-roll graphene CVD. We discuss how the foil quality and microstructure limit the uniformity of graphene over macroscopic dimensions. We conclude by discussing means of scaling and reconfiguring the CTCVD design based on general requirements for 2-D materials manufacturing.

AB  - Introduction: Muscle strength (MS) of the lower limbs is one of the main components required for specific actions during practice of 5-a-side football and when the levels are insufficient, elevated bilateral imbalances or marked difference in agonist/antagonist ratio (AAR) are factors that contribute to the development of musculoskeletal injuries. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess levels of peak torque, bilateral difference in force production and conventional ratio of flexor and extensor musculature of the knee in different speeds. Methods: The study included 11 visually impaired athletes. The athletes underwent anthropometric measurements to determine body composition and underwent evaluation at the isokinetic dynamometer to measure the levels of muscle imbalance and conventional ratio. Results: In concentric movements of the flexor muscles, significant differences were observed in peak torque (PT) between the dominant limb (DL) and non-dominant limb (NDL) at 60 degrees.s(-1) and 180 degrees.s(-1), the peak torque standardized (PTS) at 60 degrees.s(-1) and 180 degrees.s(-1) to the extensor muscles. In AAR, there was significant difference between DL and NDL, and acceptable levels of AAR in both legs according to the proposed for conventional football. Conclusion: It is expected that the results of this study may contribute to the processes of prevention, training and rehabilitation in athletes of 5-a-side football, also, serve as parameters for future studies.

AB  - Hamstrings injuries are one of the most frequent injuries in football players. Exercise programs leading to lower levels of injury, diminishing their recurrence and severity are extremely important for coaches, physical therapist and players. To recognize the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of exercise intervention programs in the prevention of hamstring injuries, in male football players. Different studies were selected for revision from several databases. To evaluate the methodological quality of these studies we used the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and determined the strength of the evidence using the best evidence synthesis grading system. The used exercise programs where based in concentric and eccentric strength, the eccentric strength exercise Nordic Hamstrings, The FIFA 11+, and flexibility exercises. The variables studied were: the incidence, the incidence of new injuries, recurrence of injuries, the severity, and the risk of injuries. The concentric and eccentric strength program and the Nordic Hamstrings program seem to be the most effective in reducing the incidence of injuries and the incidence of new injuries, respectively (limited evidence). The Nordic Hamstrings program does not reduce the risk of injuries (limited evidence) and does not improve the level of severity of the injuries (moderate evidence). The FIFA 11+ program does not reduce the incidence of injuries (limited evidence). There are contradictory evidences on the other variables.

AB  - [Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effect of shoulder positions and speeds on internal and external rotation torque of college baseball players and age-matched non-players. [Subjects] Twenty first-level collegiate baseball players and 19 college students were recruited. [Methods] A dynamometer system was used to evaluate the shoulder rotation strength in sitting postures. Three testing positions, namely shoulder abduction of 45 degrees, 70 degrees, and 90 degrees in the scapular plane, were combined with three testing speeds at 60 degrees/s, 120 degrees/s, and 210 degrees/s. [Results] The maximum external and internal rotation torques both occurred at shoulder abduction of 70 degrees. However, only external rotation torque was affected by the speed, with the peak value observed at 60 degrees/s. The internal rotation torque of baseball players was larger than that of the control group under all testing conditions, but the external rotation did not show any difference. The ratio of external to internal rotation torque changed with the testing positions and speeds in both groups. The ratio in the control group was greater than that in the player group. [Conclusion] The shoulder position could affect the rotational strength, and the baseball players could strengthen their external rotators for better performance and injury prevention.

AB  - Previous investigators have proposed that knee strength, hamstrings to quadriceps, and side-to-side asymmetries may vary according to soccer field positions. However, different results have been found in these variables, and a generalization of this topic could lead to data misinterpretation by coaches and soccer clubs. Thus, the aim of this study was to measure knee strength and asymmetry in soccer players across different field positions. One hundred and two male professional soccer players performed maximal concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee actions on the preferred and nonpreferred legs at a velocity of 60 degrees.s(-1). Players were divided into their field positions for analysis: goalkeepers, side backs, central backs, central defender midfielders, central attacking midfielders, and forwards. Results demonstrated that only goalkeepers (GK) differed from most other field positions on players' characteristics, and concentric peak torque across muscles. Although all players presented functional ratios of the preferred (0.79 +/- 0.14) and nonpreferred (0.75 +/- 0.13) legs below accepted normative values, there were no differences between positions for conventional or functional strength ratios or side-to-side asymmetry. The same comparisons were made only between field players, without inclusion of the GK, and no differences were found between positions. Therefore, the hamstrings to quadriceps and side-to-side asymmetries found here may reflect knee strength functional balance required for soccer skills performance and game demands across field positions. These results also suggest that isokinetic strength profiles should be considered differently in GK compared with other field positions due to their specific physiological and training characteristics.

AB  - In order to know whether principal stress orientations in the source area rotated after the 2011 April 11 M-w 6.6 Fukushima-Hamadori earthquake in NE Japan, we investigated detailed spatial distributions of stress orientations for both the pre- and post-main shock periods using a large amount of focal mechanism data. We applied stress tensor inversions to focal mechanism data from Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention's F-net broadband seismic network and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The sigma(3)-axes estimated for the pre-main shock period are predominantly oriented WSW-ENE, and are relatively homogeneously in space. In contrast, the orientations of the sigma(3)-axes show a significantly heterogeneous distribution in space for the post-main shock period. In the northern subarea of the focal region, the sigma(3)-axes are oriented NW-SE. In the east and west portions of the central subarea, they are oriented NNW-SSE and WNW-ESE, respectively, almost perpendicular to each other. In the southern subarea, the sigma(3)-axes are oriented WSW-ENE. On the whole, the sigma(3)-axis orientations show concentric circle-like distribution surrounding the large slip area of the M-w M-w 6.6 main shock rupture. The change of principal stress axis orientations after the earthquake is not significant because of the sparse data set for the pre-main shock period. We calculated static stress changes from the M-w 6.6 main shock and three M-w > 5.5 earthquakes to compare with the observed stress axis orientations in the post-main shock period. The sigma(3)-axis orientations of the calculated total static stress change show a concentric circle-like distribution surrounding the large slip area of the main shock, similar to that noted above. This observation strongly suggests that the spatially heterogeneous stress orientations in the post-main shock period were caused by the static stress change from the M-w 6.6 main shock and other large earthquakes. In order to estimate the differential stress magnitude in the focal area, we calculated deviatoric stress tensors in the post-main shock period by assuming that they are the sum of the deviatoric stress tensors in the pre-main shock period and the static stress changes. Comparison of the calculated and observed stress tensors revealed differential stress magnitudes of 2-30 MPa that explain the observed stress orientations, considering the probable range of estimated stress ratios in the pre-main shock period.

AB  - We present the fabrication and experimental demonstration of three free-standing binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs, which are applicable for telescopes with partially obscured pupils. Three masks, designed to be complementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5 mu m thick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask. The design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working angle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring mask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function. Mask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region (i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source comprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center wavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum chamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The coronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the designs. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3-8 lambda/D and 8-12 lambda/D was similar to 10(-4)-10(-7) and similar to 10(-7), respectively, where. is the wavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast of Mask-B was similar to 10(-4) and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5-25 lambda/D) was similar to 10(-5)-10(-6). The effect of tilting the masks was investigated, and found to be irrelevant at the similar to 10(-7) contrast level. Therefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast free-standing masks

AB  - Shock recovery techniques, such as the flyer-plate impact test, are used to examine a material that has been subjected to a single well-defined shock, followed by a single release wave. One of the key requirements of this type of technique is that the process should be such that any change found in the sample after recovery, can only be attributed to the shock process alone. Therefore, the principal problem for a test specimen-fixture assembly is that it is designed such that the loading history of the recovered specimen is known. This has motivated this research through the analysis led design of a shock recovery experiment. The choice of Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis for this design work was driven by the method's ability to accurately track history variables (for plastic deformation) and treat contact interactions which are crucial in this problem.
   Starting from an initial configuration, LS-Dyna has been used to analyse in detail the resulting wave propagation to ensure the generation of a uniaxial strain state in the specimen through Lagrangian distance-time diagrams. These iso-maps enabled the identification of potential shortcomings with the initial design, in terms of the transmission of contact and the influence of radial release waves at the different boundaries between specimen and supporting fixture rings.
   The benefits of using Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis for this design work are its ability to track history variables (for plastic deformation) and contact treatment. Based on these findings, a new configuration was developed, which consists of an array of concentric rings that support the specimen. During shock formation in the specimen, these rings progressively transfer the loading in the impact direction and radially away from the specimen, acting as momentum traps and preventing unwanted release waves from affecting the strain state experienced by the specimen.
   Comparing distance time diagrams between original and proposed configurations, a design sensitivity analysis was performed, where the new geometry resulted in a decrease of both the residual velocity (-38%) and radial displacement (-27%) of the target when compared to the original setup.

AB  - Self-centering concentrically braced frame (SC-CBF) systems have been developed to increase the drift capacity of braced frame systems prior to damage. The SC-CBF has a column base detail that permits column uplift at a specified level of overturning moment resulting from lateral forces, softening the lateral force-lateral drift behavior of the system. Restoring forces from vertically-oriented posttensioning bars provides self-centering and reduces residual drift in the SC-CBF. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-CBF systems, a comparative study of seismic performance of SC-CBF systems with that of conventional CBF systems is performed using seismic fragility and engineering demand (e.g., peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift) hazard curves. First, two prototype buildings are designed with the same configuration, with either CBF or SC-CBF frames as the lateral-load-resisting system. Then both structures are analyzed using nonlinear time history finite element modeling under earthquake records that have various seismic characteristics. The seismic responses are then utilized to build accurate probabilistic demand models for peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift. Finally, fragility curves for three performance levels (immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention) and engineering demand hazard curves are generated using the developed probabilistic demand models. The comparison of the fragilities and engineering demand hazard curves of the two structural systems reveals that the SC-CBF system exhibits better seismic performance than the conventional CBF system.

AB  - This article proposes a detailed study of the hollow core of the staircase, itself lodged in the core of the famous double staircase of the Chateau of Chambord. The empty center of this concentric staircase, constructed in the 1530s, is formed by cylindrical columns whose bases and figured capitals are deformed, distorted, according to an incline close to the vertical. The perfect integration of these sculptures in a highly restricted space has, up to the present, prevented the comprehension of their extreme originality.
   The analysis of the complex stereotomy of the six rotations that mark the core of this staircase calls attention to a veritable feat, both sculptural and architectural. It has not been possible to And anterior or even posterior, equivalents of these accomplishments. The premise can barely be seen in the renascent architecture of the Val de Loire, in particular the two staircases of the Chateau of Blois.
   These realizations seem close to anamorphoses, those optical curiosities fashionable in the 1530s. However, here they are carried out in three dimensions, something unique. The author or authors remain unknown, as does the technical apparatus used for their execution. The insertion of a concentric staircase with its highly complex core equally necessitated several adaptations of the main double staircase, ultimately making a global analysis of the three staircases indispensable.

AB  - Many advanced designs of nuclear reactors adopt a methodology of passive safety systems in order to avoid the occurence of a severe accident. In one of such systems, the decay heat generated from a reactor is transferred by natural circulation into large pool of water called the Gravity Driven Water Pool (GDWP). Three-dimensional (3D) convection flows develop, which in turn affect the heat transfer process and hence the temperature pattern. The heat transfer process can get compromised by the possible stratification of the temperature. Further, the material of construction of GDWP may have certain temperature limitations and puts bounds on the extent of stratification. The objective of this study is to investigate the 3D natural circulation phenomenon in GDWP. The present work is in continuation of our earlier work Gandhi et al. [1,2] where the natural convection has been analyzed in 0.025 and 0.21 m(3) vessels. Now, we have reported the simulation for 9247 m(3) GDWP tank. Single phase CFD simulations using open source CM code [OpenFOAM-1.6] have been performed for a geometry (ID = 12 m, OD = 50 m and height (HT) = 5 m). In order to reduce the thermal stratification, various geometrical modifications have been incorporated on the heat exchanger design, such as (1) distributing the heat transfer area of heat exchanger among single, double and multiple heat sources (2) to optimize the location of heat exchanger inside the GDWP (3) provision of passive elements such as draft tubes (single or concentric multiple) around the heat source at the center, which can act as a chimney. A detailed CFD analysis of three dimensional temperature and velocity distribution in the secondary side of GDWP has confirmed the mitigation of thermal stratification phenomenon by optimizing the distribution and position of heat exchangers. Passive draft tubes also result in significant enhancement in natural circulation and hence reduction in thermal stratification. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper combines previous cratering studies and numerical modeling of the impact process at different impact velocities to predict crater morphology on Pluto. As an icy body, Pluto's craters are expected to be similar in morphology to those on the icy satellites: lesser depth-diameter ratios (d/D), shallower wall slopes and the development of central uplifts in craters of smaller rim-to-rim diameter than craters on rocky bodies of similar gravity. The low impact velocity of the Pluto system (similar to 2 km s(-1)) might cause deviation from this generalization as the simulations presented in this work suggest that decreasing impact velocity from 10 km s(-1) to 2 km s(-1) results in deeper craters (larger dID) and a simple-to-complex transition diameter at larger crater sizes than predicted based on gravity scaling alone (D > 6 km). Conversely, decreasing impact velocity from 2 km s(-1) to 300 m s(-1) produced smaller d/D, akin to the lower dID noted for secondary craters. This complex relationship between impact velocity and dID suggests that there might be a larger range of 'pristine' simple crater depths on Pluto than on bodies with higher mean impact velocity. The low impact velocities and correspondingly low volumes of impact melt generated at Pluto might prevent the occurrence, or limit the size, of floor-pits if their formation involves impact melt water. The presence, or not, of central floor-pit craters on Pluto will thus provide a valuable test of floor-pit formation theories. The presence of summit-pits or concentric craters on Pluto is plausible and would indicate the presence of layering in the near sub-surface. Palimpsests, multi-ring basins and other crater morphologies associated with high heat flow are not expected and would have important implications for Pluto's thermal history if observed by New Horizons.

AB  - Typically, an automatic face authentication (FA) procedure begins with data (facial images) acquisition, procedure that can be carried out with or without human monitoring (in unconstrained settings), the subsequent steps being automatically processed. When the human monitoring is absent for the access procedure (i.e., the system is operating in the "wild"), the current FA systems can be easily cheated by spoofing identities using photographs or recorded video playback containing genuine information. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to indicating potential spoof attacks when a video recording of a genuine user is playback in front of a FA system. The approach relies on detecting specific image artifacts, more precisely oscillating patterns. Smooth image areas are first identified in the pixel domain as containing potential oscillating-like patterns. Several image statistics are next extracted and corresponding feature vectors are formed. Eventually, these feature vectors are classified as real or attack feature vectors by means of Lagrangian Support Vector Machines (LSVMs). When compared to two state-of-the-art methods, namely local binary patterns (LBP) and concentric Fourier based features, the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms the two for this particular type of video data.

AB  - The family Herpestidae (cusimanses and mongooses) is a monophyletic radiation of carnivores with remarkable variation in microhabitat occupation and diel activity, but virtually nothing is known about how they use vision in the context of their behavioral ecology. In this paper, we measured the number and topographic distribution of neurons (rods, cones and retinal ganglion cells) and estimated the spatial resolving power of the eye of the diurnal, forest-dwelling Ansorge's cusimanse (Crossarchus ansorgei). Using retinal wholemounts and stereology, we found that rods are more numerous (42,500,000; 92%) than cones (3,900,000; 8%). Rod densities form a concentric and dorsotemporally asymmetric plateau that matches the location and shape of a bright yellow tapetum lucidum located within the dorsal aspect of the eye. Maximum rod density (340,300 cells/mm(2)) occurs within an elongated plateau below the optic disc that corresponds to a transitional region between the tapetum lucidum and the pigmented choroid. Cone densities form a temporal area with a peak density of 44,500 cells/mm(2) embedded in a weak horizontal streak that matches the topographic distribution of retinal ganglion cells. Convergence ratios of cones to retinal ganglion cells vary from 50:1 in the far periphery to 3:1 in the temporal area. With a ganglion cell peak density of 13,400 cells/mm(2) and an eye size of 11 mm in axial length, we estimated upper limits of spatial resolution of 7.5-8 cycles/degree, which is comparable to other carnivores such as hyenas. In conclusion, we suggest that the topographic retinal traits described for Ansorge's cusimanse conform to a presumed carnivore retinal blueprint but also show variations that reflect its specific ecological needs.

TI  - NEW OFFSHORE PILE FOR REDUCED ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS - RESULTS FROM FULL SCALE TESTING
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015
LA  - English

AB  - Impact pile driving of steel piles in marine environments produces extremely high sound levels in the water, which causes deleterious effects on fauna. It has been shown that traditional pile driving noise attenuation techniques are limited because a significant portion of the noise from marine pile driving is transmitted through the sediment into the water. To combat this problem, we have developed a new double walled pile design to decrease the noise transmitted into the sediment and the water.
   The double walled pile shoe is designed to provide a flexible and water tight connection between two concentric piles, allowing for an air gap between the inner and outer pile. The assembly is driven into the sediment using traditional equipment by striking the inner pile only. The air gap between the inner and outer pile prevents the radial deformation wave produced by the pile hammer from interacting with the water. The outside pile is effectively decoupled from the inner pile leaving only pile toe deformations to emit acoustic pressure waves into the surroundings. The spherical nature of the pile toe source results in greater spreading loss, and the attenuation from the soil is increased as the pile is driven to greater depths.
   In this paper we will describe the mechanics of noise generation in both single and double walled piles as well as share results from a recent full scale field test in Puget Sound, Washington. The use of double walled piles reduces the peak sound pressure over 20 dB relative to single walled piles. We also show that only a 3 to 6 dB reduction is obtained when a bubble curtain is used on a single walled pile.

AB  - A heterotrophic dinoflagellate isolated from the waters of Masan Bay, Korea was, at first glance, morphologically similar to ICatodinium glandulum, yet had unreported plate patterns and DNA sequences. This dinoflagellate had thin plates arranged in a Kofoidian series Po, X, 4', 2a, 6", 6c, PC, 3 + s, 5", Op, and 2", similar to species in the family Pfiesteriaceae. However, it did not have a closing plate (cp) and only small sulcal plates (3 + s). Furthermore, this dinoflagellate had a conspicuous apical hook (finger-like projection) on the epitheca, like K. glandulum and Katodinium asymmetricum, but unlike the other Katodinium species and the other species in the family Pfiesteriaceae. The epitheca had a conical shape and was markedly larger than the hemispherical hypotheca. Cell lengths and widths of live biflagellate cells satiated with the phototrophic dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra were 21.2-29.2 i.m and 18.124.9 pm, respectively, while those of biflagellate cells starved for 4 d were 10.2-17.3 pm and 7.714.6 iJm, respectively. The ratio of the width of the epitheca relative to the hypotheca (0.9) is similar to that of K. glandulum, but larger than that of K. asymmetricum (0.5-0.7). The dinoflagellate had a peduncle but lacked an eyespot. The DNA sequences differed from those of K. glaucum, the only Katodinium species with reported rDNA sequences. Compared to the other known genera in the family Pfiesteriaceae, the rDNA sequences of the small subunit (SSU), ITS regions (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), and D1-D3 large subunit (LSU) differed by 1.9-6.8%, >4.4%, and >5.6%, respectively. In a phylogenetic tree based on the SSU and LSU rDNA, a clade containing this species belonged to a larger clade of the family Pfiesteriaceae, but was divergent from a clade containing K glaucum. Due to its morphological similarity to K. glandulum and genetic differences from K. glaucum and the other species in the family Pfiesteriaceae, it is proposed that this species Aduncodinium glandula be assigned to be a new genus and a new combination, A. glandula.

AB  - Papilio butterflies depend highly on visual information in their flower-foraging behavior. The retina of Papilio xuthus has been studied well, whereas the visual system in the brain is poorly understood. By investigating outputs from the optic lobe to the central brain, we found that the mushroom body of P. xuthus receives prominent direct inputs from the optic lobe in addition to olfactory inputs. The mushroom body consists of three components: the calyx, the pedunculus, and the lobes. The calyx is further subdivided into two cup-shaped primary calyces and an accessory calyx. Each primary calyx consists of three concentric subareas, the inner zone, the outer zone, and the rim of the outer zone. Dextran injections into the optic lobe, the calyx, or the antennal lobe revealed three visual inputs and one olfactory input into the calyx. The visual inputs originate from the medulla, the lobula, and a newly identified neuropil, the ventral lobe of the lobula. All visual inputs first innervate the accessory calyx, and the two lobula inputs further spread their processes through the inner zone and the rim of the outer zone of the primary calyces. Visual inputs from the medulla and the ventral lobe of the lobula collect light information from ventral eye regions, suggesting a role in visual target detection rather than sky compass orientation. In contrast to visual inputs, olfactory inputs innervate only the calycal outer zone. The multisensory inputs to the mushroom bodies in P. xuthus are probably related to their flower-foraging behavior. J. Comp. Neurol. 523:162-182, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Concentric tube robots are catheter-sized robots that are ideally suited for navigating along natural anatomical pathways and treating deep-seated pathologies. Their telemanipulation in dynamic environments requires on-line computation of inverse kinematics with simultaneous avoidance of anatomical obstacles. Moreover, unstable configurations, which arise for elongated curved robots that navigate extremely tortuous paths, must be avoided. To achieve on-line computations, existing work has investigated Jacobian approximations and configuration-space precomputation. This paper leverages the state-of-the-art multi-core computer architectures to deliver real-time local inverse kinematics solutions using the established concentric tube robot mechanics models while avoiding both instabilities and anatomical collisions. Furthermore, it considers frictional active constraints for concentric tube robots, i.e. viscoelastic force fields that guide the operator away from obstacles and towards safe configurations. The value of the proposed framework is demonstrated on realistic clinical scenarios.

TI  - Expressions of Hybridity as Strategy for Malayan Nationalism: Selected Artworks in Modern Malayan Art

AB  - This paper examines selected artworks produced by Malayan artists of Chinese descent during the 1950s and 1960s within the contexts of Malayan nationalism and cultural identity. Local art historical writing frequently discusses their works as individualistic journeys in art, detached from nationalistic discourse and derivative of Western artistic movements. By employing the notions of hybridity to re-examine their works, this paper argues that this misleading view of their works is based on essentialist and static conceptions of Malayan culture. In contrast, this paper demonstrates how the artists employed non-essentialist concepts of identity based on otherness rather than similarity, to construct a criterion for authenticity and belonging. It emphasises the agency of the artists as active participants in the making of the new Malayan nation state within the field of art. It posits their works collectively as expressions of hybridity as strategy for Malayan nationalism. Subsequently, the notion of hybridity enables the viewing of cultural exchanges and borrowings in art within a horizontal model of cultural development rather than a concentric one which privileges Western culture or Chinese culture at the centre. This research employs a qualitative research methodology based on primary and secondary resources. This includes semi-structured interviews, first-hand viewing of artworks at art galleries, state-owned museums and private collections; archival research and secondary sources such as books, exhibition catalogues, newspapers, journal articles and unpublished dissertations. The theoretical framework is interdisciplinary in approach, supplementing art historical methods with those from cultural studies. This approach is in line with methods of "the new art history" which avoids purely formalistic analysis and emphasises the importance of contextual analysis. This paper contributes not only to the writing and analysis of Malaysian modern art but may be viewed comparatively to other Southeast Asian modern art histories who share similarities in their employment of Western modern art and their search for a legitimate national cultural identity.

AB  - This paper proposed a image fog removal method. The method based on the disinhibition properties of retinal neurons concentric receptive field whose function is three Gaussians. Firstly, we enhance original fog image by using contrast limited global histogram equalization. Secondly, a local image enhancement method is carried out to restore the image's details and deepness information. According to comparison experiment, the results of this paper's method were compared with the results of dark channel prior based method and the results of CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). The experimental results proved that the method of contrast limited global histogram equalization was able to avoid enhancing too light and to avoid adding noising. In addition, local details enhancement by three Gaussians strengthened the image's depth information. The method of this paper worked well in images fog removing and enhanced fog images' visibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The isokinetic hamstrings to quadriceps (H:Q) dynamic control ratio (DCR) is frequently used to assess muscle imbalances and to screen for potential risks of knee injuries in sports.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between knee conventional ratio (CR) and DCR in elite soccer players and check for a possible relationship. A positive correlation would indicate that the CR could predict DCR.
   METHODS: One hundred and thirteen Brazilian elite soccer players (25.2 +/- 5.3 yrs) performed maximal dominant and nondominant knee concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) strength tests at 60 degrees/s on an isokinetic dynamometer in order to calculate CR and DCR.
   RESULTS: A significant positive correlation between ratios was found for the dominant and non-dominant knees (r = 0.54 and 0.62; p < 0.001 which translated into low R-2 values of 0.29 and 0.39, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: This suggests that the CR may not replace the DCR and is thus of a limited clinical value in assessing knee muscles imbalance. On the other hand, the paper presents for the first time a robust reference frame for the isokinetic strength and related ratios of the two major knee muscles in soccer players.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns are highly complex and diverse, but they are believed to be derived from the nymphalid groundplan, which is composed of several color pattern systems. Among these pattern systems, the marginal band system, including marginal and submarginal bands, has rarely been studied. Here, we examined the color pattern diversity of the marginal band system among nymphalid butterflies. Marginal and submarginal bands are usually expressed as a pair of linear bands aligned with the wing margin. However, a submarginal band can be expressed as a broken band, an elongated oval, or a single dot. The marginal focus, usually a white dot at the middle of a wing compartment along the wing edge, corresponds to the pupal edge spot, one of the pupal cuticle spots that signify the locations of color pattern organizing centers. A marginal band can be expressed as a semicircle, an elongated oval, or a pair of eyespot-like structures, which suggest the organizing activity of the marginal focus. Physical damage at the pupal edge spot leads to distal dislocation of the submarginal band in Junonia almana and in Vanessa indica, suggesting that the marginal focus functions as an organizing center for the marginal band system. Taken together, we conclude that the marginal band system is developmentally equivalent to other symmetry systems. Additionally, the marginal band is likely a core element and the submarginal band a paracore element of the marginal band system, and both bands are primarily specified by the marginal focus organizing center.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation 2015
AB  - Comprised of multiple precurved concentric tubes, continuum tubular robots are capable to reach surgical targets while bypassing critical anatomical obstacles during minimally invasive surgeries, such as transnasal and transoral surgeries. To automatically track the surgical target and compensate undesired disturbance, an eye-in-hand image-based visual servoing algorithm is presented in this paper to control in-house continuum tubular robots. The proposed visual servoing approach does not require any prior knowledge on kinametic models of the robots in order to avoid the errors introduced by imaging-sensor calibration and 3D position reconstruction. Preclinical cadaveric experiments have been demonstrated in the paper to illustrate the feasibility of the model-free automatic visual servoing method.

CP  - 34th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)
AB  - Location-based Social Discovery (LBSD) services enable users to discover their geographic neighborhoods to make new friends. Original LBSD services were designed to provide the exact distances to nearby users. It has been shown that it is easy to pinpoint any target user's location by using trilateration based on the exact distances from three fake GPS locations to the target user. To thwart the trilateration attack, contemporary LBSD services then began to report distances of nearby users in concentric bands, e.g., bands of 100 meters. In this paper, we investigate the user location privacy leakage problem in LBSD services reporting distances in discrete bands. Using number theory, we analytically show that by strategically placing multiple virtual probes with contrived fake GPS locations, one can nevertheless pinpoint user locations in band-based LBSD. Our methodology guarantees to pinpoint any reported user within an area bounded by one square meter, even for LBSD services using large bands (such as 1 0 0 m as used by WeChat). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly exploits and quantifies user location privacy leakage in band-based LBSD services. Our study is expected to draw more public attention to this serious privacy issue and hopefully motivate better privacypreserving LBSD

AB  - In this paper, according to different images of shifting, rotation and scale invariance properties, we propose a multiple features method for image retrieval. Firstly, we get the main area of the image to avoid the affections by some nonsignificant scenes. Secondly, we split the image into five parts, and utilize the pixels distribute information of every sub-image to get the representative points. Positional relationship among these representative points of the sub-blocks remain the same when the image suffers shifting or scaling transformation. By this means, the image can be expressed in a sample way and avoid complex shape detection. Then, in order to get the more detail information, the image is divided into several concentric rings, and we statistic the number of pixels in each annulus area to construct the third feature. Finally, combining these features with a certain weight coefficients and the hybrid characteristic is put forward. Experiments show that this method can achieve good effect of image retrieval and flexible to compute.

TI  - Design and Testing of a Shell-Encapsulated Solar Collector with the Compound Surface Concentrators
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - This paper presents design and testing of a shell-encapsulated solar collector which can be used in north area of China for wall-amounting installation. The designed solar collector is based on the combination of a novel compound curved surface concentrator and an aluminum concentric solar receiver, which is contained in a glass evacuated-tube. As there is no perforative joint between the double-skin glass evacuated-tube and the aluminum concentric solar receiver, the difficulty of vacuum keeping for a glass-metal joint is avoided. The cavity shell provides an additional thermal insulation to reduce heat loss of the designed solar collector. The working principle of the compound curved surface concentrator is described. The ray-tracing results are given to show the effect of deviation angle of the concentrator on its optical efficiency, hence determining its maximum acceptance angle. A prototype of the designed solar collector has been constructed and tested under the sunny winter weather condition. The experimental results indicate that the hot water temperature higher than 80 degrees C with a daily average efficiency of about 45 similar to 50% has been achieved at the average ambient temperature below 0 degrees C, so the designed solar collector can produce hot water at a useful temperature in winter.

AB  - Background: Obstacle crossing is an important activity of daily living, necessary to avoid tripping or falling, although it is not fully understood how transtibial amputees adapt to performing this activity of daily living following discharge from rehabilitation.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal adaptations in obstacle crossing in transtibial amputees post-discharge from rehabilitation.
   Study design: Longitudinal repeated measures.
   Methods: Seven unilateral transtibial amputees crossed an obstacle 0.1m high positioned along a walkway while kinematic and kinetic data were recorded at 1, 3 and 6 months post-discharge.
   Results: At 6 months post-discharge, walking velocity had increased (0.17 m.s(-1)) with most participants self-selecting an intact lead limb preference. During swing phase, peak knee flexion (p = 0.03) and peak knee power absorption (K4; p = 0.01) were greater with an intact versus affected lead limb preference. Having crossed the obstacle, intact limb peak ankle power generation in pre-swing (A2; p = 0.01) and knee power absorption (K3; p = 0.05) during stance phase were greater when compared to the affected limb.
   Conclusions: Obstacle crossing improved, although a greater reliance on intact limb function was highlighted. Results suggested that further improvements to locomotor performance may be obtained by increasing affected limb knee range of motion and concentric and eccentric strength of the knee extensors and flexors.
   Clinical relevance The novel objective data from this study establish an understanding of how recent transtibial amputees adapt to performing obstacle crossing following discharge from rehabilitation. This allows for evidence-based clinical interventions to be developed, aimed at optimising biomechanical function, thus improving overall locomotor performance and perhaps subsequent quality of life.

TI  - Flex Track One Sided One Up Assembly
T2  - SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE
LA  - English
AB  - The Boeing Company is striving to improve quality and reduce defects and injuries through the implementation of lightweight "Right Sized" automated drill and fasten equipment. This has lead to the factory adopting Boeing developed and supplier built flex track drill and countersink machines for drilling fuselage circumferential joins, wing panel to spar and wing splice stringers. The natural evolution of this technology is the addition of fastener installation to enable One Up Assembly. The critical component of One Up Assembly is keeping the joint squeezed tightly together to prevent burrs and debris at the interface. Traditionally this is done by two-sided machines providing concentric clamp up around the hole while it is being drilled. It was proposed that for stiff structure, the joint could be held together by beginning adjacent to a tack fastener, and assemble the joint sequentially using the adjacent hole clamp up from the previous hole to keep the joint clamped up. This process would significantly decrease the costs and complexity that is usually associated with two sided equipment involved in One Up drilling and fastening. This paper will examine the equipment and testing completed to prove out the process of using adjacent hole clamp up to achieve One Up Assembly.

AB  - Studies were conducted to assess glacial acetic acid (GAA) with various host plant volatiles (HPVs) and the sex pheromone, (E, E)-8, 10-dodecadien-1-ol, of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L), as lures in traps for tortricid pests that often co-occur in tree fruits in the western United States. In addition to codling moth, field trapping studies were conducted with oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), the leafroller Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott, and the eyespotted budmoth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermuller). HPVs included ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester), (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, butyl hexanoate, (E)-beta-ocimene, (E)-beta-farnesene, and farnesol. Three types of GAA co-lures differing in a 10-fold range in weekly evaporation rates were tested. The evaporation rate of GAA co-lures was an important factor affecting moth catches. The highest rate tested captured fewer codling moth but more leafrollers and eyespotted budmoth. GAA co-lures caught both sexes of each species. The field life of butyl hexanoate and (E)-beta-ocimene lures were much shorter than pear ester or sex pheromone lures. Adding GAA to pear ester or to (E)-beta-ocimene significantly increased the catches of only codling moth or oriental fruit moth, respectively. Combining pear ester or (E)-beta-ocimene with GAA did not affect the catch of either species compared with the single more attractive HPV. Adding HPVs to GAA did not increase the catches of either leafroller species or eyespotted budmoth. Traps baited with pear ester, sex pheromone, and GAA for monitoring codling moth were also effective in classifying pest pressure of both leafroller species within orchards.

AB  - The current research aims to analyse theoretically and evaluate a self-manufactured simple design for subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) emitter to avoid root and soil intrusion. It was composed of three concentric cylindrical elements: an elastic silicone membrane; a polyethylene tube with two holes drilled on its wall for water discharge; and a vinyl polychloride protector system to wrap the other elements. The discharge of the emitter depends on the change in the membrane diameter when it is deformed by the water pressure. The study of the operation of this emitter is a new approach that considers mechanical and hydraulic principles. Thus, the estimation on the membrane deformation was based on classical mechanical stress theories in composite cylinders. The hydraulic principles considered the solid deformation due to force based on water pressure and the general Darcy Weisbach head-loss equation. Twenty emitter units, with the selected design, were handcrafted in a lathe and were used in this study. The measured pressure/ discharge relationship for the emitters showed good agreement with that calculated by the theoretical approach. The variation coefficient of the handcrafted emitters was high compared to commercial emitters. Results from field evaluations showed variable values for the relative flow variation, water emission uniformity and relative flow rate coefficients, but no emitter was obstructed. Therefore, the current emitter design could be suitable for SDI following further studies to develop a final prototype. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, the use of Buckling Restrained Brace systems (BRBs) in preventing the progressive collapse of the structural frame against fire is investigated using the stiffness reduction technique. Four-storey steel structures fitted with different bracing configurations were modelled using the Vulcan programme. For comparative purpose, the efficiency of BRBs in preventing the progressive collapse of the structure is compared with the Ordinary Concentrically Brace systems (OCBs) in the presence of edge and central bay fire exposures. In order to consider the effect of bracing member stiffness on the collapse prevention of the frame and to provide a comprehensive scheme of progressive collapse mechanism under fire condition, several cross sections of BRBs under different fire scenarios are considered. The results indicate that BRBs provide a higher global collapse temperature for the frame, owing to a greater stiffness and more symmetrical performance offered as compared to OCBs, and thus providing better progressive collapse resistance. Moreover, it is observed that BRBs are stiff enough to redistribute the sustained load by heated columns to adjacent members without any buckling occurrence in the bracing member, maintaining the stability of the whole frame through both heating and cooling phases of fire.

AB  - The purpose was to examine the acute effect of pre-exercise static stretching on barbell power and velocity during the bench press exercise. Forty male high school athletes performed 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) testing and were divided into either a static stretching (SS), or a no stretching (NS) protocol. Subjects performed 1 set of 3 repetitions of the bench press with 50% 1 RM as a warm-up. SS then performed a series of stretching exercises for the involved muscles. After completing either the bench press warm-up or the stretching protocol, subjects executed one bench press repetition at 85% 1 RM. After 24 hours, the groups switched protocols. Concentric mean barbell power and velocity were measured during the 85% lift. Stretching resulted in significantly lower mean power (NS= 366.6 +/- 115.7 W, SS=282.7 +/- 111.4W) and mean velocity (NS=0.413 +/- 0.103 mxs(-1), SS=0.302 +/- 0.086 m.s(-1)) when compared to NS. Static stretching has an acute detrimental effect on muscular performance.

AB  - Beak marks on butterfly wings have been used as an indicator of predation pressure. The relationship between butterflies and their predators in the field was examined to evaluate the beak mark rate as an indicator of predation pressure. Transect censuses were conducted to measure the beak mark rate on butterflies from May to November, 2010, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. A total of 1216 butterflies of 42 species from five families were observed during the study period. The beak mark rate in the Papilionidae was significantly higher than those of all other families. Analysis of the monthly fluctuations in the beak mark rate and relative abundance of predators revealed that the higher beak mark rates observed for two butterfly families (Papilionidae and Nymphalidae) were significantly and positively related to predation pressure, while no significant relationship was found for other families (Lycaenidae, Pieridae and Hesperiidae). Beak marks in larger butterflies (Papilionidae and Nymphalidae) can be used as an indicator to evaluate the relative intensity of predation pressure in the field.

AB  - Background: Deworming wild foxes by baiting with the anthelmintic praziquantel is being established as a preventive technique against environmental contamination with Echinococcus multilocularis eggs. Improvement of the cost-benefit performance of baiting treatment is required urgently to raise and maintain the efficacy of deworming. We established a spatial model of den site selection by urban red foxes, the definitive host, to specify the optimal micro-habitats for delivering baits in a new modeling approach modified for urban fox populations.
   Methods: The model was established for two cities (Obihiro and Sapporo) in Hokkaido, Japan, in which a sylvatic cycle of E. multilocularis is maintained. The two cities have different degrees of urbanization. The modeling process was designed to detect the best combination of key environmental factors and spatial scale that foxes pay attention to most (here named 'heeding range') when they select den sites. All possible models were generated using logistic regression analysis, with "presence" or "absence" of fox den as the objective variable, and nine landscape categories customized for urban environments as predictor variables to detect the best subset of predictors. This procedure was conducted for each of ten sizes of concentric circles from dens and control points to detect the best circle size. Out of all models generated, the most parsimonious model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) inspection.
   Results: Our models suggest that fox dens in Obihiro are located at the center of a circle with 500 m radius including low percentages of wide roads, narrow roads, and occupied buildings, but high percentages of green covered areas; the dens in Sapporo within 300 m radius with low percentages of wide roads, occupied buildings, but high percentages of riverbeds and green covered areas. The variation of the models suggests the necessity of accumulating models for various types of cities in order to reveal the patterns of the model.
   Conclusions: Our denning models indicating suitable sites for delivering baits will improve the cost-benefit performance of the campaign. Our modeling protocol is suitable for the urban landscapes, and for extracting the heeding range when they select the den sites.

AB  - Imbalance in shoulder rotator muscles is a well-documented problem in swimmers, and it is important to implement land-based strength training programs. Meanwhile, the effects of a detraining period on swimmers' shoulder rotator muscles are unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of a strength training program and detraining on the strength and balance of shoulder rotator cuff muscles in young swimmers, despite the continuity of usual water training. An experimental group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 20) of young male swimmers with the same characteristics (age, body mass, height, training volume, and maturational state) were evaluated. In both groups, the peak torques of shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) rotators were assessed during preseason, mid-season (16 weeks), and postseason (32 weeks). The experimental group underwent a strength training regimen from baseline to 16 weeks and a detraining period from 16 to 32 weeks. Concentric action at 60 degrees.s(-1) and 180 degrees.s(-1) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. The ER/IR strength ratios were obtained. At 60 degrees.s(-1), there were significant increments in IR strength and the ER/IR ratio in both shoulders. This trend was the same throughout the competitive season. The tendency was the same at 180 degrees.s(-1) because training effects were noted primarily in IR and ER/IR ratios. Moreover, the absence of land-based strength training, from 16 to 32 weeks, revealed a reduction in the ER/IR ratio values in both shoulders. Our findings suggest that young swimmers' coaches should use dry-land strength training protocols, and that it is recommended that these should be conducted on a regular basis (during the whole season).

AB  - Three temporary pools of Scjenane region (northern Tunisia) have been studied with the aims of characterizing their vegetation, and of specifying the impact of grazing on their structure, composition and dynamics. Permanent transects of quadrats have been surveyed in spring and summer during two (not-grazed pool) to three years (grazed pools). The vegetation of the three pools is organized in three concentric belts related to the topographic gradient. The between-years dynamics is strongly characterized by the alternation of distinct spring and summer vegetations. Grazing appears as the main control of the composition and structure of hydrophytic plant communities. It prevents the colonization by competitive, perturbation-sensitive species, and favours the persistence of annual, light-demanding dwarf plants. In order to protect the biodivcrsity of these rare habitats in Tunisia, it is necessary to maintain, through an adapted management of grazing, a landscape mosaic of grazed and not-grazed zones

AB  - This paper investigates a new seismic rehabilitation technology for low-rise and mid-rise steel Concentrically Braced Frames (CBFs) vulnerable to inter-story drift concentration and soft-story failures. The technology consists of installation of a single or multiple sufficient Rocking Cores (RCs) pinned to the foundation and connected to an existing deficient multi-story CBF building to re-distribute seismic forces along its height and create more uniform inter-story drift and ductility demand distributions. Two benchmark steel CBF buildings including one three-story and one six-story are rehabilitated using the RC technology. Nonlinear static pushover analyses are conducted to demonstrate the beneficial contribution of the RC in mitigating non-uniform inter-story drift distributions in the benchmark buildings. The RC stiffness is varied and the Monte-Carlo simulation technique is adopted to generate random lateral force distributions in the nonlinear static pushover analyses. It is shown that the RC is effective in reducing interstory drift concentration in both benchmark buildings when they reach the inter-story drift limits associated with collapse prevention, lift safety and immediate occupancy per FEMA 356. This paper also presents the strength demands on RC and the links connecting RC to existing frame from the nonlinear static pushover analyses, which are essentially caused by the first mode responses of the rehabilitated systems.

AB  - Background: The Kalligrammatidae are distinctive, large, conspicuous, lacewings found in Eurasia from the Middle Jurassic to mid Early Cretaceous. Because of incomplete and often inadequate fossil preservation, an absence of detailed morphology, unclear relationships, and unknown evolutionary trends, the Kalligrammatidae are poorly understood.
   Results: We describe three new subfamilies, four new genera, twelve new species and four unassigned species from the late Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan and mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formations of China. These kalligrammatid taxa exhibit diverse morphological characters, such as mandibulate mouthparts in one major clade and siphonate mouthparts in the remaining four major clades, the presence or absence of a variety of distinctive wing markings such as stripes, wing spots and eyespots, as well as multiple major wing shapes. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the Kalligrammatidae are divided into five principal clades: Kalligrammatinae Handlirsch, 1906, Kallihemerobiinae Ren & Engel, 2008, Meioneurinae subfam. nov., Oregrammatinae subfam. nov. and Sophogrammatinae subfam. nov., each of which is accorded subfamily-level status. Our results show significant morphological and evolutionary differentiation of the Kalligrammatidae family during a 40 million-year-interval of the mid Mesozoic.
   Conclusion: A new phylogeny and classification of five subfamilies and their constituent genera is proposed for the Kalligrammatidae. These diverse, yet highly specialized taxa from northeastern China suggest that eastern Eurasia likely was an important diversification center for the Kalligrammatidae. Kalligrammatids possess an extraordinary morphological breadth and panoply of adaptations during the mid-Mesozoic that highlight our conclusion that their evolutionary biology is much more complex than heretofore realized.

AB  - Objective: To isokinetically record shoulder strength scores and range of motion in a professional rugby league squad. To prospectively monitor injuries over a season looking for associations between measured variables and injury.
   Design: A cohort study design involving prospective screening of risk factors with subsequent injury surveillance.
   Setting: University Sports Science Laboratory and Professional Rugby League Club.
   Participants: All players participating in the clubs reserve team squad for the 2011 season (n = 20).
   Main outcome measures: Concentric (Con) and eccentric (Ecc) peak torque values; ratio of Ecc internal rotation IR to Con external rotation ER, also known as the dynamic control ratio (DCR), shoulder range of IR and ER.
   Results: Eight players (36%) received a total of eleven injuries over the season. There were no statistically significant differences between injured and non-injured shoulders. IR range of movement was significantly lower in injured versus non-injured groups with left (p = 0.022) and right (p = 0.024). Left IR range of movement was predictive of injury using binary logistic regression (p = 0.046). No isokinetic strength parameters reached statistical significance (p > 0.05) for prediction of injury; however size effects were apparent for reduced con IR of the left shoulder and Ecc IR of both shoulders.
   Conclusion: Reduced shoulder IR range appears predictive of future shoulder injury although caution is drawn due to small participant numbers. Injury prevention strategies for rugby league players should include exercises to improve shoulder IR and possibly Ecc IR strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have previously shown that the selective sigma-1 receptor (sigma R-1) antagonist S1RA (E-52862) inhibits neuropathic pain and activity-induced spinal sensitization in various pre-clinical pain models. In this study we characterized both the behavioral and the spinal neurochemical effects of S1RA in the rat formalin test. Systemic administration of S1RA produced a dose-related attenuation of flinching and lifting/licking behaviors in the formalin test. Neurochemical studies using concentric microdialysis in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of awake, freely moving rats revealed that the systemic S1RA-induced antinociceptive effect occurs concomitantly with an enhancement of noradrenaline levels and an attenuation of formalin-evoked glutamate release in the spinal dorsal horn. Intrathecal pre-treatment with idazoxan prevented the systemic S1RA antinociceptive effect, suggesting that the S1RA antinociception depends on the activation of spinal (2)-adrenoceptors which, in turn, could induce an inhibition of formalin-evoked glutamate release. When administered locally, intrathecal S1RA inhibited only the flinching behavior, whereas intracerebroventricularly or intraplantarly injected also attenuated the lifting/licking behavior. These results suggest that S1RA supraspinally activates the descending noradrenergic pain inhibitory system, which may explain part of its antinociceptive properties in the formalin test; however, effects at other central and peripheral sites also account for the overall effect.

AB  - The paper describes a deterministic algorithm based on simple analytical equations for designing planar circular sparse array antennas where the positions and the dimensions of the radiating elements are jointly exploited and optimized. The proposed solution permits addressing one of the main limitations associated to sparse arrays, i.e., their poor aperture efficiency especially when patterns with low sidelobe levels are obtained using only the density of the elements avoiding any amplitude tapering. The accuracy of the method is guaranteed by the fact that the achieved directivity differs from the target value, associated to a continuous reference aperture distribution, by a quantity asymptotically equal to the factor pi/4 (corresponding to about -1.05 dB) representing the filling factor of a circular planar array organized in concentric rings populated by circular apertures. As required for several applications, the method includes the possibility to add a constraint on the maximum scanning angle with respect to the boresight direction.

AB  - Background: Awareness of prevalence, determinants, and prognosis of asymptomatic untreated prehypertension is still lacking especially in India and subcontinent. The present study was to assess the effects of prehypertension on structure, function and geometrical pattern of left ventricle on the basis of left ventricular mass (LVM), left ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI/Ht), and relative wall thickness (RWT) recorded by echocardiography based on the American society of echocardiography (ASE) convention.
   Methods: The study population included prehypertensives (n 61; 31 M, 30 F) and normotensives (n 38; 19 M, 19 F) between age 25 and 65 years, and were assessed by echocardiography.
   Results: It was observed that the stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), were found to be little elevated but was not significant in hypertensive females compared to normotensives. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), end systolic stress (ESS), and end isovolumetric systolic stress (EISS) were significantly elevated (p< 0.001) in female prehypertensives compared to normotensives. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was significantly (p< 0.05) elevated, indicating alterations in cardiac morphology and functions even during prehypertensive stage. However, in prehypertensive males, SBP, DBP, HR, PP, MAP, ESS, and EISS were significantly (< 0.001) raised; ejection fraction (EF%) and fractional fibre shortening (FS%) were noted to be within normal range in both sexes. Prehypertensive males showed changes in left ventricular geometry in the form of concentric remodeling (CR-3.44%), eccentric hypertrophy (EH-3.44%) and concentric hypertrophy (CH-13.79%). Prehypertensive females showed (CR-6.45%), (EH-3.22%) and (CH-6.4%).
   Conclusion: Such findings carry prognostic implication and require further population survey involving a larger group. Early diagnosis of prehypertension will help to take necessary preventive measures to reduce mainly the future cardiovascular complications. The care of prehypertensive subjects should include, to reduce the afterload in order to improve the left ventricular contractile state as early as possible. So it is advisable to do routine echocardiography after the age of 40 years.

AB  - This paper describes the development of ductile fuse system for steel angle bracings to reduce the seismic demand to the connections of concentrically braced frames. In such type of structure, the connections often need reinforcement to resist the tensile capacity of the bracing to comply with the capacity design procedure recommended by most design codes. In this research, various models of ductile fuses consisting of smoothly reduced angle section are placed on the X-bracing of a braced frame. The fuses are designed to reduce the tensile capacity of braced members to the capacity of the bolted connections. To evaluate the performance of the fuse system, two different thicknesses of single angle members with leg width of 64 mm part of an X-bracing are tested cyclically in a 1.75-m high frame representing a building story. It was observed that the braced frame with fuse could be used to reduce seismic load demand to the connections sufficiently to avoid connection strengthening that would result from the application of the capacity design principles. It was observed that properly designed fuse system in braced frame showed stable hysteretic response under cyclic loading and maintained adequate ductility with a reasonable compromise on the compressive strength of braced members. Finally, based on the study results, most efficient fuse patterns are identified for practical design applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The open field test is used to assess ambulation and anxiety; one way to assess anxiety is to compare ambulation in the center with ambulation in the periphery: the more anxious is the mouse, the less it moves in the center. The results of this report cast doubts on the generality of that rule, because they show that ambulation, both in the center and in the periphery, depends on the mouse strain and on the size of the open field; specifically, in a brightly lit open-field of moderate size (38 x 31 x 25 cm), ambulation in the center reflects anxiety in Balb/c mice, but not in C57Bl/6 mice. Yet, a large open-field (100 x 100 x 30 cm), receiving approximately the same amount of light as in the mouse room, allows assessment of anxiety and exploration-driven ambulation in both strains of mice. To do that, the author of this report proposes (i) to express ambulation in normalized scores (i.e., ambulation per surface unit) to verify that ambulation in the periphery is higher than ambulation in the center, (ii) to use an open field sufficiently large so that mice of any strain ambulate more in the periphery than in the center, and (iii) to measure ambulation in concentric strips of the open field and plot ambulation against the distance of the strips from the wall: it is proposed that the intercept of the line reflects exploration-driven ambulation whereas the slope reflects fear of leaving the wall.

AB  - As a component of architectures, stone reliefs prevailing during the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220) were usually found in coffin chambers and ancestral temples. Although the stone reliefs represent stone carving techniques of the Han Dynasty (202BC-AD220), little information about these techniques were known. In this study, the digital microscope with 3D surface reconstruction based on extended depth of focus (EDF) technology was used to investigate tool marks of stone reliefs excavated at the Mausoleum of Cao Cao (AD155-AD220) at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD25-AD220). The tool marks analysis shows that different carving techniques were involved. The surface was ground by a rotary grinding tool. Small flat-head tool could be used to lower the background. Curved lines were engraved by an oblique attack technique and the burin was held at the angle of about 35 degrees to the contact surface. Thin straight lines were engraved by an upright attack technique. Concentric circles were possibly engraved by the dragging action of a tool like a h-shaped compass. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the EDF technology provide a new effective approach for tool marks analysis. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is a disease that causes obstructions to develop within the arterial system; these obstructions can result in an acute vascular event such as a heart attack or stroke, and potentially death. In the majority of cases a standard angioplasty balloon is sufficient to dilate the site of an obstruction; however difficult obstructions, such as heavily calcified lesions require specialist dilation solutions. One such example of a device is Boston Scientific's cutting balloon. An analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database demonstrates that the original cutting balloon has a number of distinct adverse events associated with it. In this study we describe the design, manufacturing, and testing of a new force focused angioplasty balloon that has the potential to reduce or eliminate the adverse events associated with the Boston Scientific cutting balloon. This design incorporates two elastomeric materials to aid recoiling of the device namely: nitinol and a silicone elastomer. New methods of manufacturing are described in this study, that ensure that precision molding and assembly can occur. To determine the effectiveness of our device, we simulated concentric calcified lesions with a surrogate chalk model. These results demonstrate that our device has a significantly lower lesion burst pressure in comparison to a standard angioplasty balloon, 174 atm versus 12.48 atm. To determine if our device reduced potential snagging, and thus reduced the risk of withdrawal resistance being encountered, we performed a withdrawal resistance test. A noticeably lower withdrawal force is associated with our device, the high peaks on the Boston Scientific device indicate that there may be wings forming on the balloon and these are catching on the tip of the introducer sheath. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo efficacy of our device in a porcine model. By the use of elastomeric recoiling features in a new cutting balloon design we have been able to overcome the three main reported adverse events associated with the Boston Scientific cutting balloon. Subsequently we experimentally demonstrated this improved efficacy for one particular peripheral balloon size (e.g., 5 mm diameter).

AB  - The ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus uses fagaceous tree species as its hosts, and causes Japanese oak wilt by transporting and introducing the pathogenic fungus Raffaelea quercivora into the host tree. To protect fagaceous trees, it is necessary to understand the host selection process used by the beetle in heterogeneous forests. The occurrence of beetle attack on Quercus crispula and Castanea crenata was monitored from 2008 to 2011 in two 1-ha and one 0.5-ha plots established in a secondary forest. The stem and crown densities of each fagaceous tree species were calculated at 11 different spatial scales for each individual tree. Model application and selection were performed to clarify factors affecting the probability of attack by P. quercivorus. As shown in previous studies, a higher probability of attack was predicted for Q. crispula than for C. crenata, and the predicted probability of attack was lower for trees attacked in the previous year. The effect of stem density on the probability of attack was positive at a small (radius 5m) spatial scale and negative at larger (radius 5-17.5m) scales. We interpreted this to indicate that a dense distribution of fagaceous trees in a small area had a higher probability of attack, and that this probability decreased with an increasing density of fagaceous trees in a surrounding concentric area. A positive effect of crown density was detected, suggesting that P. quercivorus has a means of detecting host trees in areas with high crown densities of fagaceous species.

AB  - Without any special qualifications, this paper proposed a novel method for concentric circles detection by using the geometrical characteristics of circle and the straight line Hough transform. A feature point neighborhood method and a normalized distance variance method are proposed to segment continuous curves and circles respectively for removing interference of noncircular objects which simplified the computation; Thirdly, circle centers and radius are detected by the straight line Hough transform. Because only two 2-dimensional voting are required for the circles detection, the proposed method avoided the problem of large storage which exists in the classical Hough transform and the detection efficiency is also enhanced. Finally, the concentric circles are identified and located according to the relation between the positions of circles. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the classical Hough transform, the proposed method improved execution efficiency greatly while maintaining high detection precision, it also offers good robustness in some complex images.

AB  - Four hundred and sixty seven coal gas explosion accidents that occurred in China between the years of 1950 and 2000 were investigated through statistical methods so as to review the overall situation and provide quantitative information on coal gas explosion accidents. Statistical characteristics about accident-related factors such as space, time, gas accumulation reasons, gas grade, ignition sources, accidents categories, and accident economic loss were analyzed. Some special conclusions have been achieved. For example, most gas explosion accidents were found to have concentricity on the space-time and hazard characteristics. Such results may be helpful to prevent coal gas explosion accidents. Moreover, comments were made on APS (Accident Prevention System) and safety culture. In conclusion, countermeasures were proposed in accordance with the results of statistical studies, including the change of safety check time.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious time-loss injuries in football. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate risk factors of ACL injuries in highlevel football players during the preseason. Thirty-five high-level players were captured by a video movement analysis system and a two-force platform. Frontal plane knee angle and vertical force were measured during the landing phase of the drop jump. Intraclass correlation coefficient was determined to assess test-retest reliability, and alpha level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There were significant differences between the stronger and weaker leg in eccentric (32.4 Ns; 95% CI; 22.9-41.8 Ns; P < .05) and concentric impulse (14.4 Ns; 95% CI, 9,8-19,1 Ns; P < .05). Additionally, 31.4% of the subjects obtained a lower limb strength imbalance higher than 15%. Furthermore, 14.2% of the subjects obtained a frontal plane knee valgus angle higher than 20 degrees. Findings of the present study are particularly significant as a functional deficit higher than 15% and an increased in valgus motion at the knee suggests an altered muscular control of the lower extremity. Furthermore, results confirmed that the test proposed in this study is reliable and sensitive to identify ACL injury intrinsic risk factors in high level male football players in order to introduce the necessary preventive measures.

AB  - The X-ray baffle is an important part of the eROSITA mirror assembly as it reduces the stray light caused by single reflections at the Wolter 1 Mirrors by more than 90%. The stray light problem and possible solutions were analyzed by ray-tracing resulting in a trade-off between effective stray light protection and avoidance of vignetting. Possible design alternatives were considered and the influences of manufacturing tolerances were studied. Other than for XMM, the eROSITA X-ray baffle could not be realized as sieve plates; instead a system of co-aligned "baffle rings" was mounted onto each of the mirror modules. The mechanical design is based on concentric Invar foils fixed by an own spider. The complete X-ray baffles were finally mounted to the mirror module while the alignment was controlled by optical means.

AB  - Organisms often evolve behaviours that increase or reinforce the protection from predators afforded by their morphological defences. For example, mimetic animals may adopt postures or locomotory behaviours that emulate a characteristic feature of their model to increase predator deception. Caterpillars with eyespots are thought to mimic snakes, and when threatened many of these caterpillars adopt a posture that appears to enhance this resemblance. Herein we evaluate the quantitative strength of evidence of behavioural mimicry in the caterpillars of 14 species by comparing how closely a series of putative snake-mimicking caterpillars resemble snakes while at rest and when threatened. Specifically, we quantified the head morphology and eye position of a range of snake species, as well as the shape of the apparent head (i.e. anterior body segments) and position of eyespots in caterpillars resting or in their defensive posture. This allowed us to objectively examine evidence for an increased resemblance to either snakes generally, or to Viperidae snakes specifically, upon adopting the defensive posture. Widening the anterior body segments during the defensive posture typically made caterpillars appear more viper-like as opposed to more snake-like in general. Enhanced resemblance to vipers upon mounting the defensive posture was apparent only from the dorsal view. Laterally, caterpillars more closely resembled snakes in the resting posture and shifting to the defensive posture instead reduced mimetic fidelity. Overall we found evidence for behavioural mimicry in all 14 species examined. We highlight that objectively quantifying mimetic fidelity can help identify key features involved in deception.

AB  - Intussusception refers to invagination or prolapse of one portion of the intestine into the part of the tract that either precedes or follows it. Young cats may be more likely to have idiopathic intussusception, and older cats with intussusception may be more likely to have primary gastrointestinal tract disease, i.e. neoplasia. An intussusception will result in either a partial or complete intestinal obstruction and this will lead to a variety of clinical signs depending on the chronicity, size and location of the intussusceptions.
   In the literature no suggestion has been made to show association between intussusception and prokinetic or choleretic drug. A one year old male Maine Coon cat was presented with a history of anorexia, depression and inability to defecate for few days. On two consecutive days the cat was treated with metoclopramide, ranitidine, hyoscine butylbromide and menbutone. On the same day of therapy vomiting started and continued for three days before the moribund cat was presented to the clinic. In transverse ultrasonographic view, a target-like mass with multiple concentric hypo- and hyperechoic rings consistent with intussusception was seen in the left mesogastrium.
   This paper describes that possible cause of intussusception may be iatrogenic by application of prokinetic metoclopramide and choleretic menbutone given to an obstipated cat.

AB  - We present a novel algorithm that automatically detects anomalies in pipeline right of the way (ROW) regions in aerial surveillance videos. Early detection of anomalies on pipeline ROWs avoids failures or leaks. Vehicles that are potential threats vary in size, shape and color. The detection algorithm should be fast to enable detection in real-time. In this paper, we propose a rotation-invariant gradient histogram based descriptor built in CIELab color space. An SVM with radial basis kernel is used as the classifier. We use only the a and b components since they represent the color values. The region of interest is divided into concentric circular regions. The number of such concentric regions is based on the size of the target. The inner regions capture the local characteristics and finer details of the image. Larger regions capture the global characteristics. A noise reducing differentiation kernel is used to compute the gradient of the region to cope with motion blur and noise introduced by atmospheric aberrations. A gradient orientation histogram is constructed in each region by voting the magnitude of gradients. The final descriptor is build by concatenating the magnitude of DFT of orientation histograms collected from a component and b components. The magnitude of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the histogram is invariant to rotations. DFT can be efficiently computed as Fast Fourier Transfrom (FFT). Since the algorithm uses a sliding window detector, it can easily be parallelized.

AB  - Lunar floor-fractured craters are a class of craters modified by post-impact mechanisms. They are defined by distinctive shallow floors that are convex or plate-like, sometimes with a wide floor moat bordering the wall region. Radial, concentric, and polygonal floor fractures suggest an endogenous process of modification. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for such deformations: viscous relaxation and spreading of a magma intrusion at depth below the crater. To test the second assumption and bring more constraints on the intrusion process, we develop a model for the dynamics of magma spreading below an elastic overlying layer with a crater-like topography. As predicted in earlier more qualitative studies, the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone prevents the intrusion from spreading laterally, leading to the thickening of the intrusion. Additionally, our model shows that the final crater floor appearance after the uplift, which can be convex or flat, with or without a circular moat bordering the wall zone, depends on the elastic thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion and on the crater size. Our model provides a simple formula to derive the elastic thickness of the overlying layer hence a minimum estimate for the intrusion depth. Finally, our model suggests that crust redistribution by cratering must have controlled magma ascent below most of these craters.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel design for constructing multi-section continuum robots with a special focus on thin (less than 1 cm diameter) and relatively longer length (more than 100 cm), along with its new kinematic modeling and performance evaluation. This spring-loaded, tendon-actuated cable-like continuum robot incorporates key features of a concentric tube style design with added local compression to most sections and actively controllable bending along its entire backbone. It also avoids a complicated and large actuator system. Such robotic cables can be well suited for current space and terrestrial applications like exploration, teleoperation, surveillance, maintenance activities, etc., benefiting from these unique structural properties.

AB  - This paper proposed a method of path planning in three-dimensional space based on concentric spherical coordinate and improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. First the model of three-dimensional path planning of UAV was analyzed. Then the encoding method based on concentric spherical coordinate system was given. The constraints were combined with the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to make the path more rational and the searching more efficiently. At the same time using Matlab7.0 as the development tool for simulation, the simulation analyses showed that the method of path planning in this paper is applicable and acceptable, which could achieve the goal of terrain following and threat avoidance (TF/TA(2)).

AB  - Concentric tube robot (CTR) comprises several precurved concentric tubes which can rotate and translate independently with respect to each other. Each pre-curved tube of a CTR can be controlled to rotate axially and translate along its axis, which enables the tip to bypass obstacles and finally reach the target position. The concentric tube robots enable surgeons to perform delicate procedures by combining the flexibility of elastic catheters with the use of operation tools, such as needles, forceps and grippers. Hence, many clinical applications of concentric tube robots are promising, such as transnasal robotic neurosurgery. Concentric tube robots are suitable for such minimally invasive surgeries because they are able to present various flexible shapes with great dexterity, which strengthens the ability of collision avoidance and enlarges the reachability of operation tools. This paper describes an image based visual servoing method to control the concentric tube robot so that it can reach a desired position. A modelless control algorithm is developed by first estimating and adjusting the Jacobian matrix based on measurement of each incremental movement traced by a single camera, and then generating the next motion using the estimated Jacobian matrix. Therefore, no kinematic model is required to control the CTR during experiments and the experimental results reveal the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes modelless feedback control of concentric tube robots based on visual servoing.

AB  - As a category of special control points which can be automatically identified, artificial coded targets have been widely developed in the field of computer vision, photogrammetry, augmented reality, etc. In this study, a novel color coded target is designed for vision measurements. A reference position is defined to avoid the repeated coding as well as simplify the coding structure, and a pair of concentric circles is utilized for the precise location of the target. An edge-based identification and location algorithm is proposed for the designed coded target. In this algorithm, a coarse-fine strategy is employed to improve the efficiency and various judgments are made to ensure the correctness of the identification. No human involvement is required except for the adjustment of thresholds in the beginning, which is conducive to the automation of measurement. The algorithm shows high accuracy and robustness in experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of the migraine aura, and the visual percept that is produces, remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify a large number of visual auras recorded by a single individual over nearly two decades to gain insight into basic aura mechanisms. An individual made detailed drawings of his visual percept of migraine aura in real time during more than 1000 attacks of migraine aura without headache over 18 years. Drawings were made in a consistent fashion documenting the shape and location of the aura wavefront or scotoma in the visual field at one minute intervals. These drawings were digitized and the spatial and temporal features of auras were quantified and analysed. Consistent patterns of aura initiation, propagation and termination were observed in both right and left visual fields. Most aura attacks originated centrally (within 10 degrees eccentricity), but there were also other distinct sites of initiation in the visual field. Auras beginning centrally preferentially propagated first through lower nasal field (69-77% of all auras) before travelling to upper and temporal fields, on both sides. Some auras propagated from peripheral to central regions of the visual field-these typically followed the reverse path of those travelling in the opposite direction. The mean velocity of the perceived visual phenomenon did not differ between attacks starting peripherally and centrally. The estimated speed of the underlying cortical event (2-3 mm/min) was in the same range as has been previously reported by others. Some auras had limited propagation and spontaneously 'aborted' after a few minutes, despite being initiated in similar locations to those that spread throughout the entire visual field. The visual percept of the aura changed corresponding with the presumed propagation from the V1 to the V2 region of the occipital cortex. In some cases the visual percept disappeared for several minutes before reappearing in a distant location, providing direct evidence that the aura can be clinically 'silent'. These results indicate that there can be multiple distinct sites of aura initiation in a given individual and suggest that the spatial pattern of propagation in the occipital cortex is non-concentric with a variable extent of propagation. The visual percept of migraine aura changes depending on the region of the occipital cortex that is involved.

AB  - Forest and wetland degradation due to human disturbance is detrimental to pond-breeding amphibians that require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their complex life cycle. in this study, we examined the importance of forest cover within concentric non-overlapping terrestrial zones on amphibian reproductive effort. on the southern Cumberland plateau, tennessee, uSa, we counted Spotted Salamander (ambystoma maculatum) egg masses in February and march 2004 at 25 ephemeral ponds either surrounded by cut or uncut forest. using regression tree analysis, we determined which of 10 local and landscape parameters (pond area, ph, temperature, maximum water depth, dissolved oxygen, canopy cover, number of ponds within 1,000 m, percent forest in 2003 within 0-164, 164-250, and 250-1,000 m) best predicted salamander egg mass densities. egg mass densities were significantly higher at ponds within uncut forests and positively associated with forest cover at all three spatial zones measured (0-164, 164-250, and 250-1,000 m). all but two ponds with surrounding cut forests contained breeding populations of a. maculatum even though the majority of the core terrestrial zone was highly disturbed. our data suggest that ephemeral ponds with disturbed core terrestrial habitats are still used by salamanders for breeding. despite the obvious importance of preserving forest habitat around wetlands, the complete loss of amphibian populations following extensive terrestrial habitat loss may be prevented by retaining aquatic habitats and forest cover at exterior spatial zones.

AB  - Near field ground motions have caused several structural damages in recent decades. As a result, seismic codes are being updated with related requirements. In this paper a comparative study on the seismic behavior of concentrically braced frames (CBFs) designed based on different seismic codes is performed. Reliability of various frames with different heights and bracing types are analyzed based on the results of "Incremental Dynamic Analysis" (IDA) under near field ground motions. Fragility curves corresponding to IO (Immediate Occupancy) and CP (Collapse Prevention) limit states are extracted based on IDA curves. Results imply that, frames designed based on the near field seismic design criteria of UBC-97 are more reliable under near field ground motions and their failure probability is less comparing to others.

AB  - Video fingerprints generated from global features are usually vulnerable against general geometric transformations. In this paper, a novel video fingerprinting algorithm is proposed, in which a new spatio-temporal gradient is designed to represent the spatial and temporal information for each frame, and a new partition scheme, based on concentric circle and rings, is developed to resist the attacks efficiently. The centroids of spatio-temporal gradient orientations (CSTGO) within the circle and rings are then calculated to generate a robust fingerprint. Our experiments with different attacks have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and discrimination.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the external (ER) and internal rotator (IR) muscles' isokinetic peak torque and conventional and functional strength ratios in handball players and controls of different ages.
   Design: Cross-sectional and descriptive analysis.
   Setting: Exercise Physiology Laboratory.
   Participants: A total of 228 participants (108 athletes and 120 controls) were divided into five groups according to age, ranging from 13 to 36 years old.
   Main outcome measures: Isokinetic tests were performed concentrically at 60 and 300 deg s(-1) and eccentrically at 300 deg s(-1).
   Results: The differences between the athletes and controls regarding the peak torque of the ER and IR muscles were significant in males older than 18 years. The peak torque of the IR and ER muscles increased significantly across age in male athletes, but not in female athletes, except in the case of ER peak torque, which differed significantly between 13 and 16 years old. The female athletes presented higher conventional ratios (0.81 +/- 0.07) than males (0.66 +/- 0.08). Values represent means and standard deviations. Athletes and controls showed mean functional strength ratios below 1.0..
   Conclusions: Although there were no muscular ratio differences between the athletes and the controls, their ratio values were below the literature-recommended reference values to prevent shoulder injuries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do Alcohol Compliance Checks Decrease Underage Sales at Neighboring Establishments?
T2  - JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS

KW  - YOUTH ACCESS
KW  - AGE
AB  - Objective: Underage alcohol compliance checks conducted by law enforcement agencies can reduce the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales at checked alcohol establishments, and theory suggests that an alcohol establishment that is checked may warn nearby establishments that compliance checks are being conducted in the area. In this study, we examined whether the effects of compliance checks diffuse to neighboring establishments. Method: We used data from the Complying with the Minimum Drinking Age trial, which included more than 2,000 compliance checks conducted at more than 900 alcohol establishments. The primary outcome was the sale of alcohol to a pseudo-underage buyer without the need for age identification. A multilevel logistic regression was used to model the effect of a compliance check at each establishment as well as the effect of compliance checks at neighboring establishments within 500 m (stratified into four equal-radius concentric rings), after buyer, license, establishment, and community-level variables were controlled for. Results: We observed a decrease in the likelihood of establishments selling alcohol to underage youth after they had been checked by law enforcement, but these effects quickly decayed over time. Establishments that had a close neighbor (within 125 m) checked in the past 90 days were also less likely to sell alcohol to young-appearing buyers. The spatial effect of compliance checks on other establishments decayed rapidly with increasing distance. Conclusions: Results confirm the hypothesis that the effects of police compliance checks do spill over to neighboring establishments. These findings have implications for the development of an optimal schedule of police compliance checks.

AB  - TGF-RII signaling prevents the development of Hassalls corpuscles.Hassalls corpuscles are concentric clusters of keratinized epithelial cells located within the thymic medulla of humans and guinea pigs but are scant in mouse and rat. They are considered to be the terminally differentiated stages of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) but the mechanisms of their origin are unclear. We have previously deleted the TGF- type II receptor (TGFRII) specifically in mouse TECs and reported that these mice have mitigated thymic involution and exhibit earlier reconstitution post-irradiation. In this study, we analyzed the differentiation of mTECs in the TGFRII-knockout mice. Interestingly, the TGFRII-knockout mice display enhanced development of Hassalls corpuscles. The expression of Aire, stromal-cell-derived factor 1 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in the thymi of the TGFRII-knockout mice was similar to that previously reported for the human thymus. In addition, the putative epithelial progenitor markers MTS20 and MTS24 labeled Hassalls corpuscles in normal mice, but the extent and intensity of this staining were greatly enhanced in Hassalls corpuscles of the TGFRII-knockout mice. The phosphorylated forms of ERK and JNK were also found in Hassalls corpuscles of the TGFRII-knockout mice. Taken together, we suggest that TGFRII-mediated signaling in TECs inhibits their development into Hassalls corpuscles in mice.

AB  - Introduction: The instrumented jump tests evaluation inform us about the functional capabilities and neuromuscular variables assisting in the care of athletes. It is essential to give a greater attention to the basic categories because it contains important stages of development of the athletes who are the future of the sport. Objective: To evaluate the functional and neuromuscular youth soccer athletes' category based on performance in jump tests. Methods: Soccer players aged between 15 and 17 years were evaluated. The following jump tests were performed on two force platforms: squat Jump; countermovement test; drop jump of 40 cm. To analyze the variables concentric and eccentric forces, impact and height of jumps, the Shapiro-Wilk test, mean and standard deviation of variables with p < 0.05 were used. Results: Of the 30 athletes evaluated, we found: three goalkeepers (10%), five quarterbacks (16.7%), one winger (3.3%), three defensive midfielders (10%), 12 midfielders (40%) and six strikers (20%). The under 17 category had higher results compared to the under 15; it was achieved maximum height of the countermovement jump over the squat jump (p < 0.05) and drop jump (p > 0.05); no difference was found in concentric force between the categories and types of jumps; greater impact force was obtained on countermovement jump and an increased strength in the right lower limb was found in all jump tests and variables. Conclusions: We found an asymmetry between the lower limbs, which may correlate with a muscle power deficit, poor eccentric movement and biomechanical errors. These predisposing factors for musculoskeletal injuries can be prevented. The instrumented evaluation of muscle force through these tests can assist club professionals as a working tool, able to enhance training programs, preparation and rehabilitation. However, more research is needed in order to evaluate different moments of the athlete's age and season.

AB  - The nitric acid plant of a domestic petrochemical complex is designed to annually produce 56,400 metric tons (based on 100% nitric acid). In the present work, radial-flow spherical bed reactor (RFSBR) for selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides (NO (x)) from the stack of this plant was modelled and compared with the conventional radial-flow reactor (CRFR). Moreover, the proficiency of a radial-flow (water or nitrogen) membrane reactor was also compared with the CRFR which was found to be inefficient at identical process conditions. In the RFSBR, the space between the two concentric spheres is filled by a catalyst. A mathematical model, including conservation of mass has been developed to investigate the performance of the configurations. The model was checked against the CRFR in a nitric acid plant located at the domestic petrochemical complex. A good agreement was observed between the modelling results and the plant data. The effects of some important parameters such as pressure and temperature on NO (x) conversion were analysed. Results show 14% decrease in NO (x) emission annually in RFSBR compared with the CRFR, which is beneficial for the prevention of NO (x) emission, global warming and acid rain.

AB  - Hamstring injuries are common in professional football and have been related to the imbalance between knee flexor and extensor strength. The aim of our study was to relate the maximum strength values of flexor eccentric/extensor concentric (Flex(exc30)/Ext(con240)) and peak torque angle with the hamstring injuries incidence sustained by football players during a season to provide reference values of this parameter to allow injuries prevention. Twenty players of a Second Division team of the Football Professional League bilaterally performed an isokinetic test of eccentric knee flexion at 30 degrees/s and concentric knee extension at 240 degrees/s during the pre-season. The Flex(exc30)/Ext(con240) ratio and the knee angle of peak torque were calculated, and the players' injuries were registered throughout the season. The results showed that two of the five injured players had Flex(exc30)/Ext(con240) ratios lower than 0,89, value that has been previously used to determine the imbalance between knee flexor and extensor strength and the risk of injury (Croisier, Ganteaume, Binet, Genty, and Ferret, 2008). In addition, another two injured players obtained ratios between 0,93 and 1,00. On the other hand, no differences in the knee angle of peak torque between injured and non-injured players were found. These results indicate that the Flex(exc30)/Ext(con240) ratio may be a useful index to determine the risk of hamstring injury in professional football players.

AB  - Let be the Euclidean Dirac operator in and let P(X) = a (m) X (m) + . . . + a (1) X + a (0) be a polynomial with real coefficients. Differential equations of the form P(D (x) )u(x) = 0 are called homogeneous polynomial Dirac equations with real coefficients. In this paper we treat Dirichlet type problems of the a slightly less general form P(D (x) )u(x) = f(x) (where the roots are exclusively real) with prescribed boundary conditions that avoid blow-ups inside the domain. We set up analytic representation formulas for the solutions in terms of hypercomplex integral operators and give exact formulas for the integral kernels in the particular cases dealing with spherical and concentric annular domains. The Maxwell and the Klein-Gordon equation are included as special subcases in this context.

AB  - Developmental studies on wing colour patterns have been performed in nymphalid butterflies, but efficient genetic manipulations, including mutagenesis, have not been well established. Here, we have performed mutagenesis experiments in a lycaenid butterfly, the pale grass blue Zizeeria maha, to produce colour-pattern mutants. We fed the P-generation larvae an artificial diet containing the mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), and the F-1- and F-2-generation adults showed various aberrant colour patterns: dorsoventral transformation, anterioposterior background colouration gap, weak contrast, disarrangement of spots, reduction of the size of spots, loss of spots, fusion of spots, and ectopic spots. Among them, the disarrangement, reduction, and loss of spots were likely produced by the coordinated changes of many spots of a single wing around the discal spot in a system-dependent manner, demonstrating the existence of the central symmetry system. The present study revealed multiple genetic regulations for system-dependent and wing-wide colour-pattern determination in lycaenid butterflies.

AB  - Although exercise reduces several cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity/diabetes, the metabolic effects of exercise on the heart are not well-known. This study was designed to investigate whether high-intensity interval training (HIT) is superior to moderate-intensity training (MIT) in counteracting obesity-induced impairment of left ventricular (LV) mechanoenergetics and function. C57BL/6J mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO mice) displaying a cardiac phenotype with altered substrate utilization and impaired mechanoenergetics were subjected to a sedentary lifestyle or 8-10 weeks of isocaloric HIT or MIT. Although both modes of exercise equally improved aerobic capacity and reduced obesity, only HIT improved glucose tolerance. Hearts from sedentary DIO mice developed concentric LV remodeling with diastolic and systolic dysfunction, which was prevented by both HET and MIT. Both modes of exercise also normalized LV mechanical efficiency and mechanoenergetics. These changes were associated with altered myocardial substrate utilization and improved mitochondrial capacity and efficiency, as well as reduced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and intracellular matrix metolloproteinase 2 content. As both modes of exercise equally ameliorated the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy by preventing LV remodeling and mechanoenergetic impairment, this study advocates the therapeutic potential of physical activity in obesity-related cardiac disorders.

AB  - Laguna Potrok Aike is a large maar lake located in the semiarid steppe of southern Patagonia known for its Lateglacial and Holocene lake level fluctuations. Based on sedimentary, seismic and geomorphological evidences, the lake level curve is updated and extended into the Last Glacial period and the geomorphological development of the lake basin and its catchment area is interpreted.
   Abrasion and lake level oscillations since at least similar to 50 ka caused concentric erosion of the surrounding soft rocks of the Miocene Santa Cruz Formation and expanded the basin diameter by approximately 1 km. A high lake level and overflow conditions of the lake were dated by luminescence methods and tephra correlation to the early Lateglacial as well as to similar to 45 ka. The lowest lake level of record occurred during the mid-Holocene. A further lake level drop was probably prevented by groundwater supply. This low lake level eroded a distinct terrace into lacustrine sediments. Collapse of these terraces probably caused mass movement deposits in the profundal zone of the lake. After the mid-Holocene lake level low stand a general and successive transgression occurred until the Little Ice Age maximum; i.e. ca 40 m above the local groundwater table. Frequent lake level oscillations caused deflation of emerged terraces only along the eastern shoreline due to prevailing westerly winds. Preservation of eolian deposits might be linked to relatively moist climate conditions during the past 2.5 ka.
   Precisely dated lake level reconstructions in the rain-shadow of the Andes document high Last Glacial and low Holocene lake levels that could suggest increased precipitation during the Last Glacial period. As permafrost in semiarid Patagonia is documented and dated to the Last Glacial period we argue that the frozen ground might have increased surficial runoff from the catchment and thus influenced the water balance of the lake. This is important for investigating the glacial to Holocene latitudinal shift and/or strengthening of the Southern Hemispheric Westerlies by using lake level reconstructions as a means to assess the regional water balance. Our interpretation explains the contradiction with investigations based on pollen data indicating drier climatic conditions for the Last Glacial period. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study describes and compares the diverse dorsal and ventral wing color patterns of Brassolini butterflies. Thirty-three species are illustrated, where pattern elements of the nymphalid ground plan are labeled in color. In general, a larger number of pattern elements can be identified on the ventral than on the dorsal surface of both wings, and the forewing has a larger number of discernible pattern elements than the hind wing. The dorsal elements are broad, diffuse, and more difficult to identify against the typically brown brassoline wing background color. Species with a light colored dorsal background served as a guide for our proposal that fewer pattern elements are present dorsally, particularly on the hind wing. Colorful bands or markings generally present on the dorsal surface seem to be associated with specific pattern elements and have correspondence to the ventral pattern. We refer to these as trailing bands, and they constitute a predominant feature of the brassoline dorsal coloration. We propose a subordinate groundplan for brassolines and interpret some of the ventral pattern variation in light of their phylogeny. Dorsal color pattern variation that leads to sexual dimorphism and mimetic resemblance are also discussed.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate if Federation Internationale de Football Association's "The 11+" injury prevention program improves physical fitness and technical performance in youth futsal players.
   Design: Randomized cohort study.
   Setting: Futsal club.
   Participants: Thirty-six futsal players (17.3 +/- 0.7 years).
   Intervention: Players were randomized to an intervention group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 18). Intervention group performed "The 11+" twice per week for 12 weeks.
   Main Outcome Measures: Isokinetic testing to access maximal quadriceps (Q) and hamstring (H) strength, vertical jump (squat jump, SJ; countermovement jump, CMJ), 5-m and 30-m sprint, agility, slalom, and balance performances were also measured.
   Results: Intervention group increased (P < 0.05) quadriceps concentric (14.7%-27.3%) and hamstrings concentric (9.3%-13.3%) and eccentric (12.7%) peak torque. Intervention group improved functional H: Q ratio by 1.8% to 8.5% (P < 0.05). Intervention group improved (P < 0.05) SJ (13.8%) and CMJ (9.9%) and 5-m and 30-m sprint (8.9% and 3.3%, respectively), agility (4.7%), and slalom (4.8%) performances. Intervention group also improved balance, by decreasing the number of falls by 30% in the nondominant limb. No changes were observed in control group.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that "The 11+" can be used as an effective conditioning means for improving physical fitness and technical performance of youth futsal players.

AB  - Trace elemental analysis of single yeast cells with time-resolved inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was successfully carried out, where a high efficiency cell introduction system (HECIS) consisting of the high performance concentric nebulizer (HPCN) and a low-volume (15 mL) on-axis spray chamber utilizing a sheath gas flow were used. Cell adsorption to the flow injector and sample tubing was reduced with the addition of a simple 4.3 mmol L-1 of NaCl solution to the cell suspension and cell flowing liquid, allowing consecutive measurements without fear of significant contamination from previous measurements. Initially using a quadrupole mass analyzer ICP-MS (ICP-QMS) at its lowest integration time (10 ms), current spikes corresponding to separate cell events were detected for several elements (Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn) on the introduction of the cell suspension. On comparing the number of peaks in the spectrum for phosphorous with the cell count using a haemocytometer, a reproducible cell transport efficiency of 75.0 +/- 4.7% was achieved. Preliminary experiments into using time of flight ICP-MS (ICP-TOFMS) for single-cell analysis were carried out, allowing quasi-simultaneous multielement detection. The spectra of Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn, with a time resolution of 1 ms were simultaneously obtained in one measurement. A relatively strong correlation was observed for the spectra between P and Zn (correlation factor 0.69), P and Mg (0.63), and Mg and Zn (0.63). These results indicate that the time resolved quasi-simultaneous multielement measurement may be useful for the correlation analysis of multielements in cells.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECUMENICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Jacques Derrida's poststructuralism and George Lindbeck's postliberalism seem strongly to challenge both each other and the possibility for meaningful interreligious dialogue. When put into controlled conversation with each other, however, they create space for theories of "concentricity" and "cultural dialects" that allow interreligious interlocutors to begin to understand one another. While many theories of interreligious dialogue denounce or avoid Ludwig Wittgenstein's insistence on particularity and the difficulty of the intelligible communication of meaning, a comparison between Derrida's and Lindbeck's semiotic hesitations can create space for a neo-Wittgensteinian approach to interreligious communication that realizes its potential in its near impossibility. In so doing, this form of dialogue will allow particularity, hospitality, and ethical hope to remain as indispensable within the dialogue as they are within the participating traditions.

AB  - Location is important for most wireless sensor network applications. A potential localisation method uses a mobile beacon instead of numerous static beacons. This method includes planning a beacon trajectory as a fundamental and interesting problem. Obstacles in practical scenarios often restrict the free locomotion of beacons. This study examines the obstacle-avoidance path-planning method, which consists of three stages. First, the network deployment region is partitioned into cells by adaptive cell decomposition, and the corresponding connectivity graph is constructed. Second, a modified max-min ant system algorithm is provided to obtain the approximate shortest global path that covers the connectivity graph. Finally, a sequence of concentric circles of adjustable radii is utilised as the local path within an obstacle-free cell. We prove that all sensor nodes deployed in obstacle-free cells can be localised by using the proposed path. Simulation results show that more than 90% of the sensor nodes in the obstacle-free region can be localised by using the given trajectory.

AB  - We propose a lattice Boltzmann method combined with a higher-order immersed boundary method using a smooth velocity field near boundaries. In usual immersed boundary methods, the body forces, which are applied only near the boundary in order to enforce the no-slip condition on the boundary, make a discontinuity of the velocity gradient on the boundary. This discontinuity makes the accuracy of flow computations only first-order in space. In order to avoid the discontinuity of the velocity gradient on the boundary, we propose a higher-order immersed boundary method for smoothly expanding the velocity field into the body domain across the boundary. The simulations of flows between two concentric cylinders show that this method achieves better than the first-order spacial accuracy both in maximum and mean error norms. In addition, we confirm that with the present method the force and the torque acting on the body can be obtained more accurately in the simulations of the flow around an oscillating circular cylinder and of the sedimentation of a sphere.

AB  - Edge bias can result from the failure of sampling estimators to account for the true sampling probabilities of trees near the edges of a stand. Numerous estimators for basal area, each with an associated sampling method, have been proposed so as to avoid or reduce edge bias. The "walkthrough" estimator by Ducey et al. (2004) is easier to use than most competitors. A modification of that estimator is proposed here and referred to as the walk through and fro estimator. Along the line that connects the sample point and a particular sample tree, distances from the tree to any intersected stand boundaries are recorded if those distances are shorter than the radius of the conceptual tree-centered plot. The recorded distances are used to calculate sample weights that allow for unbiased estimation of basal area under all circumstances. The mean squared error for this estimator is generally less than that of the walk through estimator but greater than that of the tree-concentric estimator. Several variations on the proposed estimator are described. FOR. SCI. 59(2):223-230.

AB  - In avian species, maternal IgY is selectively incorporated into the egg yolks of maturing oocytes, but the relevance of receptor-mediated uptake is unclear. Here we investigated the critical amino acid residues of IgY required for egg yolk transport by conducting mutational analyses of selected residues located along the C upsilon 3 and C upsilon 4 domains of chicken IgY. Recombinant wild-type IgY-Fc (WT) and its mutants were synthesized, and their uptakes into the egg yolks of quail were determined. Among the 17 amino-acid residues located on the C upsilon 3/C upsilon 4 interface, the substitution of Y363 at the C upsilon 3 domain to alanine abolished the IgY-Fc uptake into egg yolks. The comprehensive substitution of Y363 with other amino acids revealed that the residue at 363 needs to be allocated with aromatic amino acids to maintain the high transport ability. The deglycosylation of the N-linked carbohydrate chain by substituting N407 at the C upsilon 3 domain with alanine also caused a marked reduction of IgY-Fc uptake. The microscopic detection of the injected WT and Y363A mutant in ovarian follicles showed that the WT was concentrically accumulated in yolk granules, whereas the Y363A mutant was hardly accumulated in yolk granules, but it had infiltrated into the granulosa cell layer, suggesting that a major hurdle disturbing the infiltration of the Y363A mutant lies on the inside of the granulosa cell layer. The identification of important amino acid residues required for efficient IgY transport enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IgY transport through a specific IgY receptor in ovarian follicles.

AB  - The spatial distribution of input and output neurons in the mushroom body (MB) calyx was investigated in the silkmoth Bombyx mori. In Lepidoptera, the brain has a specialized system for processing sex pheromones. How individual pheromone components are represented in the MB has not yet been elucidated. Toward this end, we first compared the distribution of the presynaptic boutons of antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), which transfer odor information from the antennal lobe to the MB calyx. The axons of PNs that innervate pheromonal glomeruli were confined to a relatively small area within the calyx. In contrast, the axons of PNs that innervate nonpheromonal glomeruli were more widely distributed. PN axons for the minor pheromone component covered a larger area than those for the major pheromone component and partially overlapped with those innervating nonpheromonal glomeruli, suggesting the integration of the minor pheromone component with plant odors. Overall, we found that PN axons innervating pheromonal and nonpheromonal glomeruli were organized into concentric zones. We then analyzed the dendritic fields of Kenyon cells (KCs), which receive inputs from PNs. Despite the strong regional localization of axons of different PN classes, the dendrites of KCs were less well classified. Finally, we estimated the connectivity between PNs and KCs and suggest that the dendritic field may be organized to receive different amounts of pheromonal and nonpheromonal inputs. PNs for multiple pheromone components and plant odors enter the calyx in a concentric fashion, and they are read out by the elaborate dendritic field of KCs. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:10731092, 2013.

AB  - A solution layer crystallization process in a concentric annulus is presented that removes the need for filtration. A dynamic model for layer crystallization with and without a recirculation loop is developed in the form of coupled partial differential equations describing the effects of mass transfer, heat transfer, and crystallization kinetics. The model predicts the variation of the temperature, concentration, and dynamic crystal thickness along the pipe length, and the concentration and temperature along the pipe radius. The model predictions are shown to closely track experimental data that were not used in the model's construction, and also compared to an analytical solution that can be used for quickly obtaining rough estimates when there is no recirculation loop. The model can be used to optimize product yield and crystal layer thickness uniformity, with constraints on the supersaturation to avoid bulk nucleation by adjusting cooling temperatures in the core and jacket.

AB  - A new sample introduction system based on spray nebulization has been successfully developed to perform direct analysis of liquid samples by IMS. The system comprises a concentric nebulizer that generates a spray plume which is introduced in the ionization region of the IMS instrument through a temperature controlled transfer line. This system avoids previous problems of direct injection of liquid samples and maintains the countercurrent flow of inert gas necessary for the operation of the IMS instrument. Evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative capabilities of the methodology has been performed after a carefully study of the main variables affecting the spray nebulization and the transport of the analyte molecules through the transfer line. To demonstrate the usefulness of the new sample introduction system, direct analysis of drugs and drug metabolites in saliva or urine samples have been performed, obtaining accurate, reliable and sensitive results. Moreover, analytes with physico-chemical properties that limited the capability of thermal desorption as sample introduction method such as amino acids can be analyzed by using the spray nebulization methodology.

AB  - We have previously shown that the cell sorting process of animal pole cells (AC) and vegetal pole cells (VC) from Xenopus gastrulae is considered to involve two steps: concentrification and polarization. In this study, we addressed the question of what specified the spatial relationship of the AC and VC clusters during the process. First, we examined the inhibitory or facilitatory treatment for myosin 2 activity during each of the two steps. The aggregates treated with Y27632 or blebbistatin during the concentrification step showed a cluster random arrangement, suggesting the prevention of the cell sorting by inhibition of myosin 2. Meanwhile, the treatment with a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, during the same step resulted in promotion of the fusion of the AC clusters and the progression of the cell sorting, presumably by an indirect activation of myosin 2. On the other hand, the treatments with any of the three drugs during the polarization step showed that the two clusters did not appose, and their array remained concentric. Thus, the modulation of cell contraction might be indispensable to each of the two steps. Next, the activin/nodal TGF-beta signaling was perturbed by using a specific activin receptor-like kinase inhibitor, SB431542. The results revealed a bimodal participation of the activin/nodal TGF-beta signaling, i.e., suppressive and promotive effects on the concentrification and the polarization, respectively. Thus, the present in vitro system, which permits not only the cell contraction-mediated cell sorting but also the TGF-beta-directed mesodermal induction such as cartilage formation, may fairly reflect the embryogenesis in vivo.

AB  - Lockne is a concentric impact structure due to a layered target where weak sediments and seawater covered a crystalline basement. A matrix-supported, sedimentary breccia is interlayered between the crystalline breccia lens and the resurge deposits in the crater infill. As the breccia is significantly different from the direct impact breccia and the resurge deposit, we propose a separate unit name, Tramsta Breccia, based on the type locality (i.e., the LOC02 drilling at Tramsta). We use granulometry and a novel matrix line-log method to characterize the sedimentology of the Tramsta Breccia. The obliquity of impact combined with the layered target caused an asymmetric, concentric transient crater, which upon its collapse controlled the deposition of the breccia. On the wide-brimmed downrange side of the crater where the sedimentary target succession was removed during crater excavation, wide, overturned basement crater ejecta flaps prevented any slumping of exterior sediments. Instead, the sediments most likely originated from the uprange side where the brim was narrow and the basement crater rim was poorly developed, sediment-rich, and relatively unstable. Here, the water cavity wall remained in closer proximity to the basement crater and, aided by the pressure of the collapsing water wall, unconsolidated black mud would flow back into the crater. The absence of interlayered resurge deposits in the Tramsta Breccia and the evidence for reworking at the contact between the overlying resurge deposits and the Tramsta Breccia indicate that the slumping was a rapid process (<75s) terminating well before the resurge entered the crater.

AB  - Numerical simulation of damage and collapse mechanisms suffered by engineering structures can be an effective tool for a quantitative assessment of their causes. Large displacement inelastic analysis may be required in the case of highly flexible structures, such as steel roofs, which frequently experience large failures or even collapse because of buckling. This paper discusses the collapse of a long-span steel roof structure, which fell down suddenly during construction as a result of an out-of-plane buckling phenomenon induced by a gust of wind. Forensic investigations were carried out on behalf of the judicial authority to identify the causes of the accident. Based on detailed information gathered from site surveys and project documents, a three-dimensional numerical model of the as-built structure was created, and buckling analyses were performed to assess the safety level at the moment of the collapse. The as-built structure was braced through some purlins and steel cables fixed at the ground level. Structural stability was also investigated under further modeling assumptions to compare the effectiveness of several bracing systems in preventing the collapse. Analysis results showed that the as-built structure was in an unstable equilibrium condition when the wind breeze occurred. Temporary bracing elements installed on the structure instead of concentric roof braces were not sufficient to ensure the overall stability. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000302.

AB  - Steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are used widely as a seismic lateral force-resisting system. Although modern CBFs designed for high seismic regions have considerable ductility, CBFs in moderate seismic regions are expected to have limited ductility, even when designed using modern provisions. In addition, older CBFs in high seismic regions also are expected to have limited ductility. In these low-ductility systems, reserve capacity (i.e., secondary strength and stiffness) plays an important role in seismic collapse prevention. Thus, quantifying the impact of reserve capacity on earthquake response for low-ductility systems is critical. This paper presents research that used single-degree-of-freedom systems to represent low-ductility CBFs, where brace fracture causes a sudden loss of strength and stiffness. Postbrace fracture stability was studied by considering variations in reserve system strength and stiffness parameters. Performance was evaluated by considering local ductility demands on the reserve system and global drift demands. For the cases considered, the ductility capacity of the reserve system was typically a more critical constraint than global drift capacity. Reserve capacity is demonstrated to appreciably influence seismic collapse behavior, whereas primary system strength has a small influence. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000623.

Anatomic variations such as acetabular dysplasia with associated instability, and femoroacetabular impingement with abnormal constraint, will lead to abnormal joint mechanics, articular damage, and osteoarthritis. Surgical techniques such as periacetabular osteotomies, and femoral and acetabular osteoplasties enable correction of anatomic variations that cause mechanical damage to the hip joint, thereby potentially preventing or delaying development of osteoarthritis and subsequent need for joint replacement.

AB  - In this work, three water-cooled experimental solidification devices were developed, and experiments were carried out with an Al-1.5wt%Fe alloy. The three experimental setups consist of vertical cylindrical steel molds with each of them having different zones cooled by water. For the inward solidification, a cooled tube is used having its upper and bottom part thermally insulated. For the outward solidification, a cooled tube, forming an inner part, is concentrically placed inside a cylindrical mold, which is thermally insulated from the environment, by using insulating materials. For the upward solidification, the bottom part of the mold is water-cooled and consists of a thin (3 mm) disc of carbon steel, whilst the cylindrical surface is covered with insulating material to avoid lateral heat losses. A numerical solidification model based on the finite difference method is applied for the simulation of the three aforementioned cases of solidification from the chilled surface considering transient heat flow conditions. Experimental thermal readings in the castings have been used for the determination of the transient overall metal/coolant heat transfer coefficient, h, through a numerical-experimental fit of casting thermal profiles based on inverse heat transfer calculations. It was found a significant variation of h as a function of time during solidification in the three cylindrical set-ups experimentally examined, including a remarkable increase in h during the outward solidification.

AB  - Understanding the nature and extent of consumer networks in social media has been complicated by both their rapid adoption and their tendency to adapt and mutate as they have been deployed. Originally described as Web 2.0 technologies, social media appear to have shifted the locus of communicative power from brand owners, governments, and large media companies in favour of their audiences. Much has been claimed for social media marketing, but empirical studies are only recently starting to appear in leading journals, and in most cases concentrate on the role of brands, products, and services. This article presents the findings of a six-year virtual ethnography, one focused on the consumer, a study with the aim of gaining a preliminary understanding of this evolving phenomenon. It finds that social media contain sets of complex interpersonal relationships in both concentric networks and in ad hoc groupings. These networks function through multifaceted reciprocal displays in which products, services, and brands may have a role, but are more likely to be peripheral to other aspects of relationship building.

AB  - The study investigates the effects of the 11+ and HarmoKnee injury prevention programmes on knee strength in male soccer players. Under-21-year-old players (n=36) were divided equally into: the 11+, HarmoKnee and control groups. The programmes were performed for 24 sessions (20-25 min each). The hamstrings and quadriceps strength were measured bilaterally at 60 degrees S-1, 180 degrees S-1 and 300 degrees S-1. The concentric quadriceps peak torque (PT) of the 11+ increased by 27.7% at 300 degrees S-1 in the dominant leg (p<0.05). The concentric quadriceps PT of HarmoKnee increased by 36.6%, 36.2% and 28% in the dominant leg, and by 31.3%, 31.7% and 20.05% at 60 degrees S-1, 18 degrees S-1 and 300 degrees S-1 in the non-dominant leg respectively. In the 11+ group the concentric hamstring PT increased by 22%, 21.4% and 22.1% at 6 degrees S-1, 180 degrees S-1 and 30 degrees S-1, respectively in the dominant leg, and by 22.3%, and 15.7% at 60 degrees S-1 and 18 degrees S-1, in the non-dominant leg. In the HarmoKnee group the hamstrings in the dominant leg showed an increase in PT by 32.5%, 31.3% and 14.3% at 60 degrees S-1, 180 degrees S-1 and 300 degrees S-1, and in the non-dominant leg hamstrings PT increased by 21.1% and 19.3% at 60 degrees S-1 and 180 degrees S-1 respectively. The concentric hamstrings strength was significantly different between the 11+ and control groups in the dominant (p=0.01) and non-dominant legs (p=0.02). The HarmoKnee programme enhanced the concentric strength of quadriceps. The 11+ and HarmoKnee programmes are useful warm-up protocols for improving concentric hamstring strength in young professional male soccer players. The 11+ programme is more advantageous for its greater concentric hamstring strength improvement compared to the HarmoKnee programme.

AB  - Two passive smart composite plates are fabricated using one and two PZT patches that are cheaper than the PZT wafer. The composite plate is fabricated in low temperature through the hand lay-up method to avoid PZT patch decoupling and wire spoiling. The locus of the impact point is identified using the output voltage to identify the impact location using one sensor. The output voltages of the sensors are analyzed to identify the impact location using two sensors. The locations of the impacts are determined based on the crossing points of two circles and the origin of an intended Cartesian coordinate system that is concentric with one of the sensors. This study proposes the impact location identification of the passive smart composite using the low-cost PZT patch PIC155 instead of common embedded materials (wafer and element piezoelectric).

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the training effects of an injury prevention programme on neuromuscular control, strength and performance in male amateur football players.
   Eighty-one players were allocated to the "FIFA 11+" (n = 42) or a control group (CON, n = 39). The "FIFA 11+" group performed the programme 3 times a week for 9 weeks; the control group completed the usual warm-up. Primary outcomes were: time-to-stabilisation test and eccentric/concentric flexors strength. Secondary outcomes were: eccentric/concentric extensors strength, star excursion balance test, core-stability test, vertical jump, sprint, and agility.
   After controlling for covariates, significant between-group differences after the intervention (in favour of the "FIFA 11+" players) were found for time-to-stabilisation (-2.8%, 90% confidence interval [CI] -4.4 to -1.2%) and core-stability (-8.9%, -14.6 to -3.1%). Differences were also found for eccentric (3.8%, 1.4 to 6.2%) and concentric flexors strength (3.2%, 0.6 to 5.9%) at 60 degrees . s(-1) but this difference was only possibly meaningful (62.4%) from a practical point of view. No substantial and/or significant differences were found for the other outcomes.
   Performing "FIFA 11+" for 9 weeks can improve neuromuscular control. Possible worthwhile differences were found for flexors strength but there were no substantial effects in the other performance measures.

AB  - This work is concerned with the deformation behaviours at the Cu-Al contact surface during hydrostatic extrusion of a concentric Cu and Al bar. In general, the unavoidable oxidisation at the Cu-Al contact surface prevents the bonding at the Cu-Al contact. A 'local extrusion', defined as a material flow through a fractured and expanded oxidised layer, is necessary for the successful bonding at the Cu-Al contact in a post process. Experiments consisting of extrusion and sintering with a biaxial Cu-Al bar are performed and it is confirmed that a 'local extrusion' does occur. In finite element studies, focuses are given to the behaviours of the first principal strain and the stress component normal to the Cu-Al contact profile since they are essential parameters for the success of a 'local extrusion'. In this work, half die angle and extrusion ratio are considered as the most important process parameters. Effects of such process parameters on the deformation characteristics at the Cu-Al contact surfaces during hydrostatic extrusion are carefully examined.

AB  - Bushings are very important parts of the electrical power supply. They are used as transformer bushings to allow the electrical connection from the transformer winding to external equipment like busbar or overhead lines or as wall bushings for bringing "high voltage" through a wall. The design of bushings usually consists of an insulating body, for instance oil impregnated paper with concentrically inserted layers for electrical field grading or a gas chamber, a housing, usually porcelain or polymeric, and the flange. For testing of bushings it is necessary to simulate service conditions. This means oil vessels for transformer bushings and a special structure for wall bushings to simulate installation conditions are necessary. The performed electrical tests should verify that the bushing withstand the electrical stress in service. Challenges for testing bushings in the UHV range are the big dimensions of the test objects, avoiding any kind of external influences to the measuring results and the lack of relevant standards for the UHV range. This paper summarizes the experiences in testing AC and DC bushings up to 800 kV system voltages. Problems during the preparation process or during the tests which can occur and there possible solution will be shown.

AB  - A hydrodynamic-rolling hybrid bearing (HRHB) arranged in parallel is introduced, in which the radial clearance of rolling bearing is used to prevent the rotor and hydrodynamic bearing from contacting during starts and stops. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rolling bearing misalignment on performance of HRHB for providing a design guide of machining and assembling tolerance. An analytic model is developed to predict the static performance of HRHBs with a misalignment. The misalignment is represented as an offset and an include angle. Taking the misalignment into account, a force balance equation about oil film force, rolling bearing reaction and external load is derived. The effects of the misalignment on the locus of equilibrium position, the maximum eccentricity, and the transition speed are investigated. The results show that misalignment has significant influences on performance of HRHBs, but there are regions of included angle which are insensitive to the performance of HRHBs; according to the insensitive regions, requirement of alignment errors, machining and concentricity tolerance can be determined; distinct from conventional hydrodynamic bearings, the locus of equilibrium positions of misaligned HRHBs have three variation modes of monotone decreasing, monotone increasing, and increasing first and decreasing afterwards; the monotone decreasing mode of conventional hydrodynamic is not suitable for HRHBs below transition speed; and before the maximum eccentricity ratio, the variation mode of equilibrium positions locus should be determined.

AB  - Accurate, reliable and fast numerical modeling methods are required to design the optimum radial refractive index profile for single and multimode fibers to give specific dispersion characteristics prior to or even obviating costly experimental work. Such profiles include graded index and multiple concentric cladding layers. In this paper, a new numerical method is introduced which enables the derivatives of the propagation coefficient to be calculated analytically up to the third order of a single mode or multimode weakly guiding optical fiber with an arbitrary radial refractive index profile. These quantities are required to determine the group delay, tau(g), chromatic dispersion, D, and dispersion slope of the fiber. The expansion of the modal fields in terms of Laguerre-Gauss polynomials in the Galerkin method offers certain benefits. In particular, due to simplicity of the basis functions it is possible to carry out further analytical work on the results such as repeated differentiation of the matrix equation resulting from the Galerkin method to define up to the third-order derivatives of the propagation coefficients with respect to wavelength. This avoids approximation errors inherent in numerical differentiation, giving better accuracy and, at the same time, significantly reduces the computation time. A computer program was developed to demonstrate the proposed method for single and multimode fibers with radially arbitrary refractive index profiles. The paper provides simulation results to validate the approach.

AB  - In this paper we propose a method for embedding binary data in triangular mesh models. Contrary to digital images and audio which benefit from the intrinsically ordered structure of the matrix and the array. 3D triangular mesh model lacks this capital property even though it can be encoded in an array date structure. Such a lack often complicates the different aspects of data embedding, like model traversal, data insertion, and synchronization. We address this problem with a mesh data representation which encodes the mesh data into a novel ordered structure, dubbed, the Ordered Rings Facets (ORF). This structure is composed of concentric rings in which the triangles are arranged in a circular fashion. This representation exhibits several interesting features that include a systematic traversing of the whole mesh model, simple mechanisms for avoiding the causality problem, and an efficient computation of the embedding distortion. Our method can be also adapted to different scenarios of data embedding, which includes stenography and fragile watermarking.

AB  - The Carpathian Mountains across Slovakia and Romania are home of several ice caves located at elevations between 700 and 1,200 m above sea level (asl). Although the mean surface annual temperature is above the freezing point, perennial ice deposits are common in caves and shafts with certain morphologies (large entrances followed by steep vertical or downward-sloping passages), into which the dense cold winter air sinks and remains trapped all year round. A particular type of cave pearls (cryogenic cave pearls, CCPs) occur in spatially restricted accumulations or extensive pearl fields (layers locally up to 0.5 m in thickness) within the scree covering the cave floor in the periglacial zone of these caves. The temperature in the periglacial zone oscillates around the freezing point, promoting seasonal ice formation. A similar type of pearl is observed in the entrance section of other caves that experience temporary freezing conditions during the cold season. When compared to pearls of non-iced caves, those from ice caves always occur at sites where liquid water cannot accumulate. CCP formation in nests with drips or in cave pools surrounded by rimstone dams is therefore excluded. Freezing thawing processes are responsible for moving the pearls, preventing their cementation to the floor or between them. Results of U-series and radiocarbon dating indicate that the pearls are Holocene in age, with their growth continuing into the present. Pearls show high porosity, ranging from 7.6 to 22.6%. In the center they frequently contain radial aggregates of larger carbonate crystals, and their concentric layering is less obvious compared to normal cave pearls. In addition, polygonal pearls and pearl aggregates are common. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope study indicates the formation. of an initial crystal aggregate by cryogenic precipitation during freezing of drip water. After that, pearls grow by addition of new carbonate layers, either at water freezing conditions or at temperature above 0 degrees C. Overall, the pearl isotope data plot along a mixing line in the delta C-13 vs. delta O-18 diagram, connecting the field of normal speleothems of non-iced caves of the area, with the field of fine-grained cryogenic carbonate powder, formed in the glaciated parts of the ice caves. Seasonal water freezing and frost action in the cave periglacial zone is a necessary condition for the formation of these pearls.

AB  - This paper introduces balanced switching schemes to compensate linear and quadratic gradient errors, in the unary current source array of a current-steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC). A novel algorithm is proposed to avoid the accumulation of gradient errors, yielding much less integral nonlinearities (INLs) than conventional switching schemes. Switching scheme examples with different number of current cells are also exhibited in this paper, including symmetric arrays and non-symmetric arrays in round and square outlines. (a) For symmetric arrays where each cell is divided into two parallel concentric ones, the simulated INL of the proposed round/square switching scheme is less than 25%/40% of conventional switching schemes, respectively. Such improvement is achieved by the cancelation of linear errors and the reduction of accumulated quadratic errors to near the absolute lower bound, using the proposed balanced algorithm. (b) For non-symmetric arrays, i.e. arrays where cells are not divided into parallel ones, linear errors cannot be canceled, and the accumulated INL varies with different quadratic error distribution centers. In this case, the proposed algorithm strictly controls the accumulation of quadratic gradient errors, and different from the algorithm in symmetric arrays, linear errors are also strictly controlled in two orthogonal directions simultaneously. Therefore, the INLs of the proposed non-symmetric switching schemes are less than 64% of conventional switching schemes.

AB  - Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is described as the sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms caused by myofascial trigger points (TrPs). Knowing the potential causes of TrPs is important to prevent their development and recurrence, but also to inactivate and eliminate existing TrPs. There is general agreement that muscle overuse or direct trauma to the muscle can lead to the development of TrPs. Muscle overload is hypothesized to be the result of sustained or repetitive low-level muscle contractions, eccentric muscle contractions, and maximal or submaximal concentric muscle contractions. TrPs may develop during occupational, recreational, or sports activities when muscle use exceeds muscle capacity and normal recovery is disturbed.

AB  - Considering the practical geometry of rotational tool and the relation between the material parameters and temperature, the finite volume model of friction stir welding is established on basis of the ANSYS FLUENT software. The effect of shoulder geometry and pin geometry on material plastic flow behavior is studied. The results of numerical simulation show that the flow velocity of material decreases with the increase of the distance away from the weldment surface or the rotational axis of pin. The flow velocity of material inside weldment is increased by decreasing the cone angle of pine or decreasing the width of screw groove. When the rotational tool with the left screw pin rotates clockwise, the flow direction of material near pin is downward while the flow direction near the thermal-mechanical affected zone is upward, which is opposite to that of the right screw pin. From the view of improvement of material flow, the concentric-circles-flute shoulder is better than the inner-concave-flute shoulder or the plane shoulder. Therefore, choosing the reasonable shoulder geometry and the reasonable pin geometry can be good for improving the material flow during the friction stir welding process and avoiding the root defects.

AB  - Measurement of neurotransmitters in the spinal dorsal horn in conscious animals remains a technical challenge. Here we applied concentric microdialysis to measure formalin-induced glutamate (Glu) release in the ipsilateral dorsal horn in conscious, freely-moving rats. Hind paw formalin injection induced flinching nociceptive behaviors accompanied by increased Glu in the dorsal horn (maximum = 294%). Both flinching and Glu increase were prevented by morphine (3 mg/kg, s.c.). Accordingly, concentric microdialysis is a sensitive technique for studying neurochemical modulation induced by pain and analgesics in the spinal dorsal horn of awake rats. Measurement of Glu provides information on modulation of excitatory signals.

AB  - This study examines the convection and rapid filamentation in Typhoon Sinlaku (2008) using the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) P-3 aircraft data collected during the Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS-08) and The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Pacific Asian Regional Campaign (T-PARC) field experiments. The high-resolution aircraft radar and wind data are used to directly compute the filamentation time, to allow an investigation into the effect of filamentation on convection. During the reintensification stage, some regions of deep convection near the eyewall are found in the vorticity-dominated area where there is little filamentation. In some other parts of the eyewall and the outer spiral rainband region, including areas of upward motion, the filamentation process appears to suppress deep convection. However, the magnitude of the suppression differs greatly in the two regions. In the outer spiral band region, which is about 200 km from the center, the suppression is much more effective, such that the ratio of the deep convective regime occurrence over the stratiform regime varies from around 50% (200%) for filamentation time shorter (longer) than 24 min. In the eyewall cloud region where the conditions are conducive to deep convection, the filamentation effect may be quite limited. While effect of filamentation suppression is only about 10%, it is still systematic and conspicuous for filamentation times shorter than 19 min. The results suggest the possible importance of vortex-scale filamentation dynamics in suppressing deep convection and organizing spiral bands, which may affect the development and evolution of tropical cyclones.

AB  - To better understand the developmental mechanisms of color pattern variation in butterfly wings, it is important to construct an accurate representation of pattern elements, known as the "nymphalid groundplan". However, some aspects of the current groundplan remain elusive. Here, I examined wing-wide elemental patterns of various nymphalid butterflies and confirmed that wing-wide color patterns are composed of the border, central, and basal symmetry systems. The central and basal symmetry systems can express circular patterns resembling eyespots, indicating that these systems have developmental mechanisms similar to those of the border symmetry system. The wing root band commonly occurs as a distinct symmetry system independent from the basal symmetry system. In addition, the marginal and submarginal bands are likely generated as a single system, referred to as the "marginal band system". Background spaces between two symmetry systems are sometimes light in coloration and can produce white bands, contributing significantly to color pattern diversity. When an element is enlarged with a pale central area, a visually similar (yet developmentally distinct) white band is produced. Based on the symmetric relationships of elements, I propose that both the central and border symmetry systems are comprised of "core elements" (the discal spot and the border ocelli, respectively) and a pair of "paracore elements" (the distal and proximal bands and the parafocal elements, respectively). Both core and paracore elements can be doubled, or outlined. Developmentally, this system configuration is consistent with the induction model, but not with the concentration gradient model for positional information.

AB  - This paper attempts to review the descriptions on the genetic series of neotectonic forms in Eurasia. Morphotectonically, the Eurasian continental block exhibits a radial-concentric pattern consisting of four kinds of tectonic units: platforms, rejuvenated and youthful mobile belts, and the continentocean transition zones. Vast areas of young and ancient platforms, such as Siberia, have experienced slow-rate Late-Cenozoic uplift and little interior deformation. The youthful orogenic belts are clustered into the giant Alpine-Himalayan megabelt. The rejuvenated mountain belts are characterized by a variety of structural-morphological types of orogens, such as domelike uplifts, block uplifts and intermountain basins. The continent-ocean transition zones in Eastern Asia, including marginal rifts and extensional basins, are resulted from interaction between the continental block and Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea since the Late Cenozoic. One of the conspicuous features of Eurasia is that most areas lie in the largest geoid depression of the Earth, and the NS trending Uralian-Oman lineament expresses a break on the geoid slope, implying a relationship to deep structure, including density inhomogeneities, downward to the core-mantle interface. Besides, the Eurasian continent fully demonstrates morphotectonic and recent geodynamic features of the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth, just in contrast to that of the Southern Hemisphere. It is best to view the surface morphotectonics and deep structure of the Earth as a geodynamic ensemble which has spawned the large-scale geomorphic features on the surface.

AB  - To achieve a dispersion-compensation photonic crystal fiber with an ultralarge negative chromatic dispersion coefficient, this paper theoretically investigates a liquid-filled hybrid structure of dual-concentric core photonic crystal fiber (DCC-PCF) and depressed-clad photonic crystal fiber (DeC-PCF). The proposed hybrid structure reveals an important property: The design can avoid the restriction of "mutual involvement" between two supermodes, thereby significantly increasing the index slope difference between two supermodes. Ultimately, the negative chromatic dispersion coefficient is greatly enlarged. The numeric results indicate that the negative chromatic dispersion coefficient for the proposed hybrid dispersion-compensating PCFs is up to -40400 ps/(km - nm) at a wavelength of around 1.55 mu m, which is approximately 1.81 times larger than that of the previous structure.

AB  - When a catadioptric imaging system suffers from limited depth of field, a single image cannot capture all the objects with clear focus. To solve this problem, a set of multifocal images can be used to extend the depth of the field by fusing the best-focused image regions to an overall well-focused composite image. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method that avoids the computational cost problem of previous extended-depth-of-field algorithms. On the basis of the special optical geometry properties of catadioptric systems, the proposed model describes the shapes of the best-focused image regions in multifocal images by a series of neighboring concentric annuluses. Then we propose a method to estimate the model parameters. On the basis of this model, an overall well-focused image is obtained by combining the best-focused regions with a fast and reliable online operation. Experiments on catadioptric images of a variety of different scenes and camera settings verify the validity of the model and the robust performance of the proposed method.

AB  - In case of a severe accident, a debris bed is formed from a mixture of molten core and the residual water in the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel. The presence of decay heat in a debris bed poses a critical threat to the reactor pressure vessel. To avoid any damage to the reactor pressure vessel, the removal of decay heat from the debris bed is of great importance. In order to investigate experimentally the long-term coolability of debris beds, the non-nuclear test facility "DEBRIS" has been established at IKE. Experimental investigations of coolability limits for such a debris bed, based on two different bed configurations and at various thermo-hydraulic conditions, are carried out at IKE. This paper presents the experimental results for multidimensional cooling effects on boiling and dryout tests with different bed configurations and different system pressures.
   Two different down corner configurations (cylindrical and perforated cylindrical tubes with inner diameters of 10 mm each) are used to investigate the multidimensional cooling effects. The down corner is concentrically installed inside the debris bed which is contained in a cylindrical crucible with an inner diameter of 125 mm. Different bed configurations, e.g. polydispersed particle bed with spherical particles 2,3 and 6 mm in diameters and irregular particles of equivalent diameters 2-10 mm, have been used with a bed height of 640 mm. A layer of ceramic balls of diameter 4 mm with 40% porosity is used to make up a water pool at the bottom of the bed. The bottom inflow via the down comer tube as well as the lateral inflow of water through the perforated down corner tube into the bed improves the coolability of the debris bed, and therefore an increase of the dryout heat flux can be observed. Experimental results also show that the system pressure has no significant effect on the characteristics of pressure gradients inside the bed, whereas with increasing system pressure the coolability limits are increased.

AB  - Desiccating sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) to hasten harvest has become common practice in the northern U.S. and can aid in reducing yield loss associated with severe weather, plant degradation, and bird predation. Current recommendations are to apply desiccants to sunflower at 35% or less seed moisture corresponding to physiological maturity (PM). However, evidence suggests PM may occur at higher seed moisture. Therefore, a 2-yr field study was conducted at Prosper, ND, and Morris, MN, with the objective being to model the dynamic relationship of seed dry matter accumulation to moisture content in sunflower seed of two high-oleic oilseed hybrids and one confectionary hybrid to estimate seed moisture content at PM. Between stages R6 and R9 (PM), seed samples were collected from capitulum at 4-7 d intervals. Seeds were separated from the inner, middle, and outer concentric thirds of the capitulum for analysis. Average moisture content across middle and outer seed at PM for both oilseed hybrids was about 40% regardless of environment, but it was 50% for the confectionary hybrid. Inner seed lagged behind middle and outer zones in reaching PM, but only comprises about 11% of total seed on capitulum. Approximately 600-666 degrees C d were required for seed to progress from R6 to PM for the oil hybrids and 486-612 degrees C d for the confectionary hybrid. For both types of hybrids, PM occurred about 3 d later in middle seed as compared to outer seed. Indeed, our results indicate modern sunflower hybrids can be desiccated at higher seed moisture than currently recommended without sacrificing yield loss due to not reaching PM.

AB  - The dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum possesses one of the largest eyespots among the autotrophic dinoflagellates. Until now they were believed to be negatively phototactic using a non-opsin photopigment. Here we provide evidence that in newly established cultures they are positively phototactic and that the dynamic range of phototaxis is similar to 2.5 log units. Additionally, we find that the spectral sensitivity of the phototaxis agrees reasonably well with the absorption curve of a theoretical opsin, with a peak sensitivity around 500. nm. The sensitivity in the short wavelength end of the tested spectrum is unexpectedly low, but this is probably due to selective filtering. Interestingly, the phototaxis could be temporarily overruled by tactile stimuli. After physical contact with the light guide, the cells escaped the area, and we suggest that this may serve as predator avoidance.

AB  - One of the key components in sports injury prevention is the identification of imbalances in leg muscle strength. However, different leg muscle characteristics may occur in large playing area (field) sports and small playing area (court) sports, which should be considered in regular injury prevention assessment. This study examined the isokinetic hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) ratio and bilateral leg strength balance in 40 male college (age: 23.4 +/- 2.5 yrs) team sport players (field sport = 23, soccer players; court sport = 17, volleyball and basketball players). Five repetitions of maximal knee concentric flexion and concentric extension were performed on an isokinetic dynamometer at two speeds (slow: 60 degrees.s(-1) and fast: 300 degrees.s(-1)) with 3 minutes rest between tests. Both legs were measured in counterbalanced order with the dominant leg being determined as the leg used to kick a ball. The highest concentric peak torque values (Nm) of the hamstrings and quadriceps of each leg were analyzed after body mass normalization (Nm.kg(-1)). Court sport players showed significantly weaker dominant leg hamstrings muscles at both contraction speeds (P < 0.05). The H:Q ratio was significantly larger in field players in their dominant leg at 60 degrees.s(-1) (P < 0.001), and their non-dominant leg at 300 degrees.s(-1)(P < 0.001) respectively. Sport-specific leg muscle strength was evident in college players from field and court sports. These results suggest the need for different muscle strength training and rehabilitation protocols for college players according to the musculature requirements in their respective sports.

AB  - Mechanical loading is essential for bone development and prevention of age-related bone diseases. Muscular contractions during physical activity and the generated strain magnitude are primary determinants for the osteogenic response. However, the adaptation capacity of bones, especially due to different muscle contraction types, is largely unknown. In the present study we examined the effect of different running modes characterized by different muscle contraction types and loading patterns on the morphological, structural, and mechanical properties of different sites in the femur of growing rats. Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a nonactive age-matched control (AMC), a level running (LEVEL), and a 20A degrees decline downhill running (DOWN) group (n = 12 each). Running groups were trained on a treadmill for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. After death, pQCT analysis of the meta- and diaphyses, micro-CT analysis of the epiphysis, and mechanical testing of the femur were performed. The Tb.BMD in the metaphysis was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the DOWN compared to the AMC group, whereas level running had no effect on Tb.BMD. While Young's modulus was significantly different (P < 0.05) between the DOWN and LEVEL groups, no structural alterations were found in the diaphysis between the groups. Further, subchondral trabecular bone did not show exercise-induced changes caused by the different running modes but displayed a remarkably high intraepiphyseal variability. Downhill running seems to be a potent osteogenic stimulus in the femoral metaphysis.

AB  - The effects of landscape attributes on Lepidoptera communities were studied in an agricultural area in Calabria (S-Italy). The association between a set of community descriptors and landscape metrics was determined using a multi-scale approach. Lepidoptera were sampled using yellow sticky traps in 10 olive groves. The landscape in 5 concentric areas, with radii from 250 to 1250 m, around each sampling site was analyzed. The composition and configuration of the landscape were calculated both at the landscape and class level based on the main classes of land use. The following life-history traits of Lepidoptera were considered: (i) dispersal ability of adults, (ii) habitat preferences and (iii) diet breadth of larvae. An index of community vulnerability was calculated by combining life-history traits and species diversity. There were no significant correlations between any of the landscape metrics and species richness or between species richness and abundance of natural or semi-natural habitats. However, life-history traits were significantly correlated with some landscape metrics, depending on the spatial scale. Most notably, landscape diversity is positively correlated with community vulnerability. The presence of sensitive species in olive orchards, but not species richness per se, is associated with the presence of natural and semi-natural habitats in the surrounding agricultural landscape. In conclusion, responses of communities to landscape changes are more likely to be revealed by an analysis of ecological traits, than species richness. In particular, the vulnerability index, used in this joint analysis of the main ecological traits, seems to be an effective descriptor of the relationships between communities and landscape.

AB  - This article explores whether some new acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) can be applied to breast augmentation or reconstruction revision, and particularly whether they can withstand the centripetal pull and prevent recurrent stretch deformities following periareolar mastopexy. Acellular dermis use in breast reconstruction and aesthetic breast revision is a fortuitous development, because their original purpose was for burn reconstruction. Although level 1 evidence remains lacking, ADMs have become integral adjuncts in breast reconstruction, complex hernia, and aesthetic breast revision. New applications continue to be explored, although these are in early stages of development and their long-term value remains to be confirmed.

AB  - Background: To explain eyespot colour-pattern determination in butterfly wings, the induction model has been discussed based on colour-pattern analyses of various butterfly eyespots. However, a detailed structural analysis of eyespots that can serve as a foundation for future studies is still lacking. In this study, fundamental structural rules related to butterfly eyespots are proposed, and the induction model is elaborated in terms of the possible dynamics of morphogenic signals involved in the development of eyespots and parafocal elements (PFEs) based on colour-pattern analysis of the nymphalid butterfly Junonia almana.
   Results: In a well-developed eyespot, the inner black core ring is much wider than the outer black ring; this is termed the inside-wide rule. It appears that signals are wider near the focus of the eyespot and become narrower as they expand. Although fundamental signal dynamics are likely to be based on a reaction-diffusion mechanism, they were described well mathematically as a type of simple uniformly decelerated motion in which signals associated with the outer and inner black rings of eyespots and PFEs are released at different time points, durations, intervals, and initial velocities into a two-dimensional field of fundamentally uniform or graded resistance; this produces eyespots and PFEs that are diverse in size and structure. The inside-wide rule, eyespot distortion, structural differences between small and large eyespots, and structural changes in eyespots and PFEs in response to physiological treatments were explained well using mathematical simulations. Natural colour patterns and previous experimental findings that are not easily explained by the conventional gradient model were also explained reasonably well by the formal mathematical simulations performed in this study.
   Conclusions: In a mode free from speculative molecular interactions, the present study clarifies fundamental structural rules related to butterfly eyespots, delineates a theoretical basis for the induction model, and proposes a mathematically simple mode of long-range signalling that may reflect developmental mechanisms associated with butterfly eyespots.

AB  - Background: balance control is a major problem for older individuals with poor vision. There are limitations, however, for visually impaired elderly persons wishing to participate in exercise programmes. The benefits of Tai Chi for balance control, muscle strength and preventing falls have been demonstrated with sighted elderly subjects. This study was designed to extend those findings to elderly persons with visual impairment.
   Objective: to investigate the effects of Tai Chi on the balance control of elderly persons with visual impairment.
   Design: randomised clinical trial.
   Setting: residential care homes.
   Subjects: forty visually impaired persons aged 70 or over.
   Methods: the participants were randomly divided into Tai Chi and control groups and assessed pre- and post-intervention using three tests: (i) passive knee joint repositioning to test knee proprioception; (ii) concentric isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors and (iii) a sensory organisation test to quantify an individual's ability to maintain balance in a variety of complex sensory conditions.
   Results: after intervention, the Tai Chi participants showed significant improvements in knee proprioception and in their visual and vestibular ratios compared with the control group.
   Conclusion: practicing Tai Chi can improve the balance control of visually impaired elderly persons.

AB  - The use of fenoterol in the treatment of preterm labor is associated with the risk of many complications in the mother and the fetus. We present a case of a multipara treated with oral fenoterol due to threatening preterm labor 14 weeks. At 35 weeks of gestation the fetus was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe impairment of the right ventricle. The only factor that might have caused such a state of the fetal circulatory system was fenoterol, used from 21 weeks of gestation. After the withdrawal of the fenoterol the fetal right ventricular function improved gradually However, fetal cardiac hypertrophy persisted until the birth at 39 weeks of gestation. Concentric hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall and interventricular septum were confirmed in the newborn.

TI  - Evaluation of performance-based design methodology for steel self-centering braced frame

AB  - Steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are an efficient, stiff lateral force resisting system but have limited ductility capacity. Conventional CBFs have limited ductility capacity due to brace buckling. A new building frame system known as a Self-Centering CBF (SC-CBF) that has large ductility capacity and minimal residual drift under earthquake loading is being developed and has been extensively evaluated using hybrid earthquake simulation at Lehigh University's NEES Equipment Site. The ductility capacity of the SC-CBF system is increased by allowing the frame to rock on its base. High ductility vertical post-tensioning (PT) bars act to self-center the SC-CBF after an earthquake. Laboratory results show that this system performs well under intense ground motions at the design basis earthquake (DBE) and the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) levels. The SC-CBF system was also subjected to the 1995 Kobe earthquake at 0.9 -scale and performed quite well under this ground motion. A performance-based seismic design procedure has been proposed for the SC-CBF system. This design procedure targets a performance condition of immediate occupancy (IO) under the DBE and collapse prevention (CP) under the MCE. The design procedure limits yielding of the PT bars under the DBE but permits significant yielding of the PT bars under the MCE. Frame members are designed using capacity design principles to remain essentially elastic under the DBE. Some member yielding is permitted under the MCE. This paper examines the effectiveness of the SC-CBF performance-based design procedure through several prototype designs.

AB  - In the peer-to-peer video-on-demand (P2P VoD) streaming applications, providing VCR-like operations is important but much challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P scheme-Fibonacci ring overlay networks with distributed chunk storage, called FiRiNet, to reduce jump latency caused by VCR-like operations and avoid an adverse impact caused by VCR-like operations. In FiRiNet, video data is divided into chunks and stored at peers' local storage in a distributed manner. A peer can achieve fast neighbor discovery to reduce jump latency by maintaining some neighbors in a set of concentric rings with Fibonacci sequence radii. Moreover, FiRiNet constructs the overlay networks and distributes the video data based on the stored chunks, which can make FiRiNet avoid an adverse impact caused by VCR-like operations and make FiRiNet resilient to the peer churn caused by VCR-like operations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that FiRiNet is an efficient and resilient scheme with low control overhead, short jump latency, and high streaming quality.

AB  - Genetic aspects of alcoholism have been modeled using rats selectively bred for extremes of alcohol preference and voluntary alcohol intake. These lines show similar alcohol drinking phenotypes but have different genetic and environmental backgrounds and may therefore display diverse behavioral traits as seen in human alcoholics. The multivariate concentric square field(TM) (MCSF) test is designed to provoke exploration and behaviors associated with risk assessment, risk taking and shelter seeking in a novel environment. The aim was to use the MCSF to characterize behavioral profiles in rat lines from selective breeding programs in the United States (P/NP, HAD1/LAD1, HAD2/LAD2), Italy (sP/sNP) and Finland (AA/ANA). The open field and elevated plus maze tests were used as reference tests. There were substantial differences within some of the pairs of selectively bred rat lines as well as between all alcohol-preferring rats. The most pronounced differences within the pairs of lines were between AA and ANA rats and between sP and sNP rats followed by intermediate differences between P and NP rats and minor differences comparing HAD and LAD rats. Among all preferring lines, P, HAD1 and HAD2 rats shared similar behavioral profiles, while AA and sP rats were quite different from each other and the others. No single trait appeared to form a common pathway associated with a high alcohol drinking phenotype among all of the alcohol-preferring lines of rats. The marked behavioral differences found in the different alcohol-preferring lines may mimic the heterogeneity observed among human alcoholic subtypes.

AB  - Current building code requirements in the US are intended to provide life safety for building occupants during a Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) and collapse prevention during a Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). The building code identifies specific seismic lateral force resisting systems that may be used in construction. If a new lateral force resisting system is to be added to the building code, values for the global seismic performance factors must be selected and validated. The selected values can be validated through collapse analyses as described in FEMA P695. A new lateral force resisting system is being developed at Lehigh University which is similar to a Concentrically Braced Frame (CBF), but which mitigates the limited ductility and poor seismic behavior that has been observed for conventional CBFs. This new system is known as a Self-Centering CBF (SC-CBF). The SC-CBF increases the ductility capacity of the CBF system by allowing the CBF to rock on its base. Post-tensioning bars run vertically over the height of the SC-CBF to self-center the structure leaving little to no post-earthquake residual drift. This paper examines the collapse performance of the SC-CBF system for multiple prototype structures of various heights to establish the global collapse mode and capacity of SC-CBFs. Results of the incremental dynamic analyses suggest that SC-CBFs have different behavior under high intensity ground motion than conventional CBFs and MRFs. This behavior prevents the rapid growth of roof drift with a small increase in ground motion intensity after a certain intensity level, which is often observed for conventional structures at the collapse limit state, and, instead, it eventually produces an almost linear increase of roof drift with ground motion intensity increase.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process of jamming of the hollow parts on the shaft and to derive a mathematical model for jamming in an assembly process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The mathematical model for jamming of parts on the shaft in an assembly process is based on the sizes, geometry, angular declination of part and shaft axes, and the frictional factor.
   Findings - The equation for angular positional tolerance of coaxial parts and shafts, based on their geometry and sizes and leading to jamming, was derived.
   Research limitations/implications - A mathematical model of parts jamming on the shaft is developed for assembly mechanisms. This research does not consider flexible deformations of components in assembly mechanisms, which results in the axis concentricity of part and shaft in the assembly process.
   Practical implications - The results presented in the form of angular positional tolerance for coaxial parts and shafts based on their geometry and sizes make it possible to avoid the jamming of the parts. The results allow for formulating the angular positional tolerance of the assembly mechanisms that clamp the parts.
   Originality/value - The proposed method for calculating the angular positional tolerance of coaxial parts and shafts for the assembly process should allow for increasing the reliability of the assembly process in the manufacturing industry.

AB  - Hamstring muscle strains are one of the most frequent injuries in sports and will result in missed game time by athletes. A sudden and forceful eccentric muscle contraction during the later swing phase of sprinting may directly induce hamstring injury, so does a fast change between eccentric and concentric actions in the foot contact phase. Based on the biomechanical analysis of the hamstring muscle activities during sprinting and the studies focused on hamstring strength training, the purpose of this study is to design a strength training machine specific for hamstring. The activity of hamstring muscles during training simulated the key phase of sprinting in terms of contraction modes and loads. The design principle and usage of the machine, as well as the points for attention, are illustrated in this paper.

AB  - A flexible and accurate camera calibration algorithm with circles and concentric circle patterns is proposed for hand-held camera for multiview stereo (MVS) application, which can avoid user interaction for feature extraction in traditional planar pattern based camera calibration method. In order to automatically identify the features in image, we encode the circular patterns according to the size of the patterns. The unique code can be used to match features in images and planar patterns. We use three methods to extract the circle centers, e.g. ellipse fitting, perspective correction and circle chord midpoint approximation methods. Both simulation and real image data are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We use this method in multiview stereo(MVS) to reconstruct three visual hull models from image sequences. The experiments demonstrate that the concentric circle patterns have most accurate results.

AB  - Parallel imaging presents a promising approach for MRI of hyperpolarized nuclei, as the penalty in signal-to-noise ratio typically encountered with H-1 MRI due to a reduction in acquisition time can be offset by an increase in flip angle. The signal-to-noise ratio of hyperpolarized MRI generally exhibits a strong dependence on flip angle, which makes a homogeneous B-1(+) transmit field desirable. This paper presents a flexible 32-channel receive array for 3 He human lung imaging at 1.5T designed for insertion into an asymmetric birdcage transmit coil. While the 32-channel array allows parallel imaging at high acceleration factors, the birdcage transmit coil provides a homogeneous B-1(+) field. Decoupling between array elements is achieved by using a concentric shielding approach together with preamplifier decoupling. Coupling between transmit coil and array elements is low by virtue of a low geometric coupling coefficient, which is reduced further by the concentric shields in the array. The combination of the 32-channel array and birdcage transmit coil provides He-3 ventilation images of excellent quality with similar signal-to-noise ratio at acceleration factors R = 2 and R = 4, while maintaining a homogeneous B-1(+).

AB  - The Tunk Lake pluton of coastal Maine, USA is a concentrically zoned granitic body that grades from an outer hypersolvus granite into subsolvus rapakivi granite, and then into subsolvus non-rapakivi granite, with gradational contacts between these zones. The pluton is partially surrounded by a zone of basaltic and gabbroic enclaves, interpreted as quenched magmatic droplets and mushes, respectively, as well as gabbroic xenoliths, all hosted by high-silica granite. The granite is zoned in terms of mineral assemblage, mineral composition, zircon crystallization temperature, and major and trace element concentration, from the present-day rim (interpreted as being closer to the base of the chamber) to the core (interpreted as being closer to the upper portions of the chamber). The ferromagnesian mineral assemblage systematically changes from augite and hornblende with augite cores in the outermost hypersolvus granite to hornblende, to hornblende and biotite, and finally, to biotite only in the subsolvus granite core of the pluton. Sparse fine-grained basaltic enclaves that are most common in the outermost zone of the pluton suggest that basaltic magma was present in the lower portions of the magma chamber at the same time that the upper portions of the magma chamber were occupied by a granitic crystal mush. However, the slight variations in initial Nd isotopic ratio in granites from different zones of the pluton suggest that contamination of the granitic melt by basaltic melt played little role in generating the compositional gradation of the pluton. The zone of basaltic and gabbroic chilled magmatic enclaves, and gabbroic xenoliths, hosted by high-silica granite, that partially surround the pluton is interpreted as mafic layers at the base of the pluton that were disrupted by invading late-stage high-silica magma. These mafic layers are likely to have consisted of basaltic lava layers and basalt that chilled against granitic magma to produce coarse-grained gabbroic mush. Basaltic and gabbroic magmatic enclaves and gabbroic xenoliths are hornblende-bearing, suggesting that their parent melts were relatively hydrous. The water-rich nature of the underplating mafic magmas may have prevented extensive invasion of the granitic magma by these magmas, owing to the much greater viscosity of the granitic magma than the mafic magmas in the temperature range over which magma interaction could have occurred.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of an acute bout of eccentric exercise on maximal isokinetic concentric peak torque (PT) of the leg flexors and extensors and the hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio. Sixteen male (mean+/-SD: age=20.9+/-2 years; stature=177.0+/-4.4 cm; mass=76.8+/-10.0kg) volunteers performed maximal, concentric isokinetic leg extension and flexion muscle actions at 60 degrees.sec(-1) before and after (24-72h) a bout of eccentric exercise. The eccentric exercise protocol consisted of 4 sets of 10 repetitions for the leg press, leg extension, and leg curl exercises at 120% of the concentric one repetition maximum (1-RM). The results indicated that the acute eccentric exercise protocol resulted in a significant (P<0.05) decrease in isokinetic leg flexion (13-19%) and leg extension (11-16%) PT 24-72h post-exercise. However, the H:Q ratios were unaltered by the eccentric exercise protocol. These findings suggest that an acute bout of eccentric exercise utilizing both multi - and single - joint dynamic constant external resistance (DCER) exercises results in similar decreases in maximal isokinetic strength of the leg flexors and extensors, but does not alter the H:Q ratio.

AB  - The slate sweetlips, Diagramma labiosum Macleay, 1883 (Perciformes: Haemulidae), off Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, hosts 2 new species of Benedenia Diesing, 1858 (Monogenea: Monopisthocotylea: Capsalidae). Benedenia beverleyburtonae n. sp. infects proximal regions of the primary gill lamellae and gill arches. The adult is characterized by a dorsal vaginal pore anterior to the common genital pore and a voluminous, highly coiled vas deferens. This species also has fine muscle fibrils concentrically arranged in the haptor. Its ciliated oncomiracidium differs little from larvae of other Benedenia species, with the exception of at least 4 gland cells containing a granular secretion on each side of the body at the level of the excretory bladders, with fine ducts opening anterior to the eyes. Benedenia disciliata n. sp. infects gill arches and gill rakers, and the adult is characterized by its small total length, anterior hamuli with a small proximal notch, posterior hamuli with a broad, triangular shape proximally, a conspicuous internal fertilization chamber, and asymmetrical eggs. None of the 5 specimens collected had testes, but their definite absence is undetermined. Their absence and the fact that the vas deferens was discernable only distally in the specimens of B. disciliata examined may represent atrophying of the male organs. Benedenia disciliata is unique among Benedenia species because eggs are attached to the host's gill arches by tight wrapping of the appendages around spines on the gill rakers and the larva is not ciliated. Among Capsalidae species, these features are shared only with species of Dioncus Goto, 1899. Recent molecular evidence has indicated Benedenia is polyphyletic, but with no clear morphological characters available to divide the genus, the 2 new species fit the current concept for the genus more closely than other capsalid genera. Proposal and description of these taxa and accounts of their oncomiracidia and other aspects of their biology indicate potentially useful characters for division of the genus in the future.

AB  - There are concerns that genetically modified soybean might threaten the genetic diversity of the wild soybean populations that are distributed in East Asia because genetically modified soybean has no crossing barrier with wild soybean. A simple and effective method to prevent hybridization via pollen flow is spatial separation between the two species because their hybridization occurs only when they grow in close proximity. Therefore, the invasiveness of wild soybean needs to be known in order to secure the appropriate distances. As wild soybean seeds are dispersed mechanically by pod dehiscence, an experiment was conducted in which white sheets were placed on the ground, concentric circles were drawn around the parent plants, and the number of dispersed seeds within each 0.5 m-wide zone were counted. About 40% of the produced seeds were dispersed and the number of dispersed seeds gradually declined as the distance from the parent plants increased. The model that explained the relationship between the number and distance of the dispersed seeds was produced by using a generalized linear model procedure. More than 95, 99, and 99.9% of the produced seeds stayed within 3.5, 5.0, and 6.5 m after natural pod dehiscence. Knowing these values is useful for evaluating the level of invasive risk by mechanical seed dispersal. The goal of the work is to efficiently and deliberately prevent hybridization by isolating genetically modified soybean fields and wild soybean populations by vegetation management, including weeding and setting up specific-width buffer zones.

AB  - Within the context of the preparation of a flora for the identification of freshwater dinoflagellates, the identity of Glenodinium edax and the affinities of a group of phagotrophic species with a conspicuous eyespot not associated with plastids (eyespot type C) currently classified in Katodinium were re-evaluated. The original description and illustrations of the phagotrophic G. edax suggest affinity with the Pfiesteriaceae. Whereas the tabulation currently associated with G. edax is based on a probable misidentification, the similarity to Tyrannodinium berolinense suggests that the two names can be regarded as synonyms and T. edax comb. nov. is proposed. As presented in modern floras, Katodinium is artificially defined on the basis of the position of the cingulum at or below the posterior third of the cell, and includes widely different forms. The presence of an eyespot of type C in the phagotrophic Katodinium vorticella and related species combines with a general cell morphology reminiscent of Esoptrodinium gemma and the formation of Tovellia-like cysts to mark this group of species as belonging to the Tovelliaceae. The type species of Katodinium, K. nieuportense, is morphologically quite different from these species and does not display tovelliacean characters. None of the known genera of Tovelliaceae matches the characters of K. vorticella and its close relatives. Opisthoaulax gen. nov. is described and new combinations are proposed for K. vorticella and six other species.

AB  - The presence of shrub vegetation is very significant in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the difficulty involved in shrub management and the lack of information about behavior of this vegetation means that these areas are often left out of spatial planning projects. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) has been used successfully in forestry to estimate dendrometric and dasometric variables that allow to characterize forest structure. In contrast, little research has focused on shrub vegetation. The objective of this study was to estimate dry biomass of shrub vegetation in 83 stands of radius 0.5 m using variables derived from LiDAR data. Dominant species was Quercus coccifera, one of the most characteristic species of the Mediterranean forests. Density of LiDAR data in the analyzed stands varied from 2 points/m(2) to 16 points/m(2), being the average 8 points/m(2) and the standard deviation 4.5 points/m(2). Under these conditions, predictions of biomass were performed calculating the mean height, the maximum height and the percentile values 80th, 90th, and 95th derived from LiDAR in concentric areas whose radius varied from 0.50 m to 3.5 m from the center of the stand. The maximum R(2) and the minimum RMSE for dry biomass estimations were obtained when the percentile 95th of LiDAR data was calculated in an area of radius 1.5 m, being 0.48 and 1.45 kg, respectively. For this radius, it was found that for the stands (n = 39) where the DTM is calculated with high accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.20 m) and with a high density of LiDAR data (more than 8 points/m(2)) the R(2) value was 0.73. These results show the possibility of estimating shrub biomass in small areas when the density of LiDAR data is high and errors associated to the DTM are low. These results would allow us to improve the knowledge about shrub behavior avoiding the cost of field measurements and clear cutting actions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Artificially induced changes of butterfly wing colour patterns: dynamic signal interactions in eyespot development
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - EVOLUTION
KW  - GRADIENT
AB  - Eyespot formation in butterfly wings has been explained by the concentration gradient model. However, this model has recently been questioned, and dynamic interactions between the black-inducing signal and its inhibitory signal have been proposed. Here, the validity of these models was examined using a nymphalid butterfly Junonia almana. Early focal damage to the major eyespots often made them smaller, whereas the late damage made the outer ring larger and the inner ring smaller in a single eyespot. Non-focal damage at the outer ring not only attracted the whole eyespot structure toward the damaged site but also reduced the overall size of the eyespot. Surprisingly, a reduction of the major eyespot was accompanied by an enlargement of the associated miniature eyespots. These results demonstrate limitations of the conventional gradient model and support a dynamic interactive nature of morphogenic signals for colour-pattern determination in butterfly wings.

AB  - A spontaneous mutation, 'Pseudozorro', has arisen in 1998 in a captive brood of P. apollo maintained by the authors. It induces (i) the production of additional wing veins, (ii) the distortion and confluence of the black spots of the forewing discal cell and (iii) a reduction of the hindwing eyespots and, more generally, of all red components of the wing pattern. Various crosses demonstrated that 'Pseudozorro' is dominant and lethal when homozygote. Its expression is quite variable, probably due to epistatic interactions with other loci. When combined with the recessive mutation 'wiskotti', it rather attenuates its manifestations; the two loci are not linked.

AB  - Purpose: We investigated deficits in postural control and fall risk in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Method: Twenty people with moderate to severe COPD (mean age 72.3 years, standard deviation [SD] 6.7 years) with a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 46.7% (SD 13%) and 20 people (mean age 68.2 years, SD 8.1) who served as a comparison group were tested for postural control using the Sensory Organization Test (SOT). A score of zero in any trial of the SOT was registered as a fall. On the basis of the SOT results, participants were categorized as frequent fallers (two or more falls) or as fellers (one fall). To explore the potential influence of muscle weakness on postural control, knee extensors concentric muscle torque was assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer. Physical activity level was assessed with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly.
   Results: People with COPD showed a 10.8% lower score on the SOT (p = 0.016) and experienced more falls (40) than the comparison group (12). The proportion of frequent fellers and fallers during the SOT was greater (p = 0.021) in the COPD group (four of 10) than in the comparison group (two of seven). People with COPD showed deficits in knee extensors muscle strength (p = 0.01) and a modest trend toward reduced physical activity level. However, neither of these factors explained the deficits in postural control observed in the COPD group.
   Conclusions: People with COPD show deficits in postural control and increased risk of falls as measured by the SOT. The deficits in postural control appear to be independent of muscle weakness and level of physical activity. Postural control interventions and fall risk strategies in the pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD are recommended.

AB  - The processes governing the evolution of sexual dimorphism provided a foundation for sexual selection theory. Two alternative processes, originally proposed by Darwin and Wallace, differ primarily in the timing of events creating the dimorphism. In the process advocated by Darwin, a novel ornament arises in a single sex, with no temporal separation in the origin and sex-limitation of the novel trait. By contrast, Wallace proposed a process where novel ornaments appear simultaneously in both sexes, but are then converted into sex-limited expression by natural selection acting against showy coloration in one sex. Here, we investigate these alternative modes of sexual dimorphism evolution in a phylogenetic framework and demonstrate that both processes contribute to dimorphic wing patterns in the butterfly genera Bicyclus and Junonia. In some lineages, eyespots and bands arise in a single sex, whereas in other lineages they appear in both sexes but are then lost in one of the sexes. In addition, lineages displaying sexual dimorphism were more likely to become sexually monomorphic than they were to remain dimorphic. This derived monomorphism was either owing to a loss of the ornament ('drab monomorphism') or owing to a gain of the same ornament by the opposite sex ('mutual ornamentation'). Our results demonstrate the necessity of a plurality in theories explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism within and across taxa. The origins and evolutionary fate of sexual dimorphism are probably influenced by underlying genetic architecture responsible for sex-limited expression and the degree of intralocus sexual conflict. Future comparative and developmental work on sexual dimorphism within and among taxa will provide a better understanding of the biases and constraints governing the evolution of animal sexual dimorphism.

AB  - This paper considers two novel controller synthesis methodologies using a feedforward control structure for performing concentric self-servo track writing in hard disk drives. In the first methodology, it is assumed that a conventional causal track-following controller has been designed and a non-causal feedforward controller, which utilizes the stored error signal from writing the previous track, is designed using standard H-infinity control synthesis techniques, in order to prevent the track errors from propagating and to achieve good disturbance attenuation. In the second methodology, both the track-following feedback controller and the feedforward controller are simultaneously designed via a mixed H-2/H-infinity control scheme, which involves the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities and achieves good disturbance attenuation while preventing the propagation of track errors from the previous tracks. Simulation results confirm that the two proposed control synthesis methodologies prevent error propagation from the previously written tracks and significantly improve concentric self-servo track writing performance.

AB  - Crop rotation, soil tillage, variety and fungicide protection in cereal production
   Within the framework of long-term experiment devoted to cereal production, the factors variety and fungicide protection were added during three years (2006, 2008 and 2010) to the factors crop rotation and soil tillage already studied since 1967. This complement aimed at evaluating the influence of the cropping system on the development of diseases on winter wheat and discussing the impacts on yield.
   The favorable effect of sanitation measures such as crop rotation and ploughing was raised for eyespot, septoria leaf blotch and fusarium head blight. These preventive measures could be reversed by environmental conditions favorable to the later disease development. Powdery mildew and brown rust were further influenced by the environmental conditions favorable to their development. The concentration in fusarium mycotoxins depended more on the presence of previous maize than on winter wheat in mono-culture. The importance of the ploughing or a tolerant variety such as Anna could be underlined. The variety resistance constituted a crucial and stable factor for the diseases control. The efficiency of fungicide protection depends on these initial cropping measures as well as on current environmental conditions.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns consist of many color-pattern elements such as eyespots. It is believed that eyespot patterns are determined by a concentration gradient of a single morphogen species released by diffusion from the prospective eyespot focus in conjunction with multiple thresholds in signal-receiving cells. As alternatives to this single-morphogen model, more flexible multiple-morphogen model and induction model can be proposed. However, the relevance of these conceptual models to actual eyespots has not been examined systematically. Here, representative eyespots from nymphalid butterflies were analyzed morphologically to determine if they are consistent with these models. Measurement of ring widths of serial eyespots from a single wing surface showed that the proportion of each ring in an eyespot is quite different among homologous rings of serial eyespots of different sizes. In asymmetric eyespots, each ring is distorted to varying degrees. In extreme cases, only a portion of rings is expressed remotely from the focus. Similarly, there are many eyespots where only certain rings are deleted, added, or expanded. In an unusual case, the central area of an eyespot is composed of multiple "miniature eyespots", but the overall macroscopic eyespot structure is maintained. These results indicate that each eyespot ring has independence and flexibility to a certain degree, which is less consistent with the single-morphogen model. Considering a "periodic eyespot", which has repeats of a set of rings, damage-induced eyespots in mutants, and a scale-size distribution pattern in an eyespot, the induction model is the least incompatible with the actual eyespot diversity.

AB  - Aim. The aim was to assess the effects of a 12-week "rope jumping" and "weighted rope jumping" training programs on functional parameters including multi-joint coordination and proprioception, strength, endurance in adolescent female volleyball players.
   Methods. Pretest posttest experimental design. Intervention: Weighted Rope Training group (N.=9; 15+/-1 years), Rope Training group (N.=9; 14.1+/-1.3 years) and Controls (N.=7; 14.4+/-1.3 years). Main Outcome Measures: Motor coordination, proprioception, strength and endurance of the lower extremities with concentric and eccentric performances in closed kinetic chain on multi joint system assessed by the Monitorized Squat system. Absolute average error (cm) and the standard deviation for coordination and proprioception, Peak Force (N), Total Work (Nm), Average Power (Nm/s), Maximal Speed for strength and endurance tests were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U test were utilized.
   Results. Weighted rope jump group had significant decrease for the deviation results of coordination on the concentric and eccentric phases for both legs (P<0.05). Rope jump and weighted rope jump groups had significantly lower results on non visible second movement deviation (P<0.05). In strength tests, the difference was found for total work that there was difference on the post assessment within groups in favour of Weighted Rope Training group in comparison to controls (P<0.05). Weighted Rope Training and control groups improved in concentric maximal speed (P<0.05). Most significant changes occured on eccentric phaese of the endurance tests that peak force increased in Weighted Rope Training group (P<0.05).
   Conclusions. Adding rope jump to training programs improves joint repositioning and coordination. Weighted Rope Training group got greater gains for coordination and eccentric endurance parameters for lower extremities in a closed kinetic chain.

AB  - Introduction and objective: Studies that relate parameters of muscular performance in different sports, and especially in soccer, have been frequently reported in the literature. However, the methodological variations among studies, the type of dynamometer used in each search and placement of each subject during the evaluations results in the divergence of the data collected. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a data collection to provide figures on the muscular profile and establish normative parameters for the professional soccer players' muscular performance, supporting scientific research and future studies. Methods: The sample consisted of 39 athletes from a professional soccer club in Porto Alegre. In order to evaluate muscular performance, an isokinetic dynamometer was used and the tests consisted of maximal concentric contractions, being knee flexors and extensors muscles tested at 60 degrees/s and 240 degrees/s velocities. Analysis of means by t test (independent samples) was used to investigate significant differences between legs considering the parameters evaluated in this study. For all statistical procedures the confidence interval was 95% (p < 0.05). Results: The results of this study characterized the muscular profile of professional soccer players on the capacity of torque, work and maximum power, normalized by body weight. Moreover, significant differences were observed between legs considering some of the study's variables. Conclusion: The normative data set can be used as reference values for prevention, training and rehabilitation of athletes, and serve as reference for future studies with the aim to relate parameters of muscular performance and incidence of injuries in soccer.

AB  - Argopecten irradians concentricus has been cultivated along the southern coast of China for about 16 generations since its first introduction in 1991. To determine the effects of self-fertilization on the production traits of this isolated bay scallop population, 12 self-fertilized families and a mass-spawned group were produced and studied. The hatching success and survival at larvae, juvenile, and adult stages of the offspring of the mass-mated group were all significantly greater than that of 10 of the 12 self-fertilized families examined, and not significantly different from that of other 2 self-fertilized families. For newly hatched larvae on day 1, no significant difference in size was found among the self-fertilized families and the mass-spawned group. The shell length of the mass-mated group on days 9, 30, 75 and 230, and the live weight on days 75 and 230 were always significantly larger than that of 9 of the 12 self-fertilized families, and not significantly different from that of the other 3 self-fertilized families. In addition, a significant difference in survival, shell length, and live weight was seen among the 12 self-fertilized families at all development stages. The current study demonstrated the occurrence of inbreeding depression for production traits in the closed population of A. irradians concentricus and the necessity of avoiding inbreeding when creating a breeding production, although not all families are significantly affected by inbreeding.

AB  - Issues of poor circumareolar scars and asymmetry or malposition of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) are frequently associated with those breast reduction or pexy techniques that rely on an ample excision of skin around the areola, either alone or associated with a vertical scar in a circumvertical approach. To prevent such problems, in 2007 Hammond et al. introduced the "interlocking suture." The objective of this study was to demonstrate the true ability of this suture to reduce the common complications of periareolar surgery simply by managing the existing contrast between NAC centripetal and outer breast tegument centrifugal forces.
   By using finite element method (FEM) software, the NAC traditional interrupted stitches were compared with both round-block and interlocking sutures, and the skin strain in all three procedures was qualified.
   The contribution of circuitous stitches in the interlocking suture leads to a more advantageous distribution of forces. FEM analysis shows that the interlocking suture reduces skin stress on peripheral breast teguments by 14% compared to the round-block suture and by 15% compared to the traditional (radial) suture. When evaluating the areolar edge, the interlocking suture leads to a reduction in skin stress of 9.9% compared with traditional interrupted stitches.
   The efficient, long-lasting results of the interlocking suture are directly due to its unique design, which effectively reduces the tension between the NAC and breast tegument edges in periareolar surgery, thus improving the quality of the scar.

AB  - An epidemiological investigation was undertaken of 41 bovine brucellosis outbreaks that occurred within a 10-month period, in a region where eradication measures appeared to be succeeding. The primary outbreak comprised three herds with significant within-herd spread and a high probability of multiple abortions. Direct contact between cattle at pasture was the most likely means of between-herd transmission for most (71%) outbreaks, with an attack rate of 28.1% in herds immediately neighbouring the primary outbreak herds and 11.3% in the next concentric ring of farms. Resolution of the incident was attributed to a rapid response by the veterinary authorities, detailed epidemiological investigations, repeated, prolonged testing of contact herds and employment of parallel testing.

AB  - In a wireless network, when a single channel is employed, hidden terminal and radio interference problems may occur. The two problems are the main factors that cause low network throughput. In fact, the hidden node problem results from radio interference. Up to the present, many researchers have used multi-channel schemes to solve the interference problem. However, a multi-channel system causes other problems, e.g., the multi-channel hidden terminal problem, and the channel assignment problem. Actually, a well-defined channel assignment can effectively solve the former problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-channel assignment system, called a corona-oriented multi-channel assignment system (COMAS for short), which as a metropolitan scale system coordinates channel usage for wireless networks to mitigate radio interference among APs and nodes so as to improve network throughput and efficiency, particularly when many nodes are connected to APs. In the COMAS, APs are deployed as concentric circles, named coronas, and channels are grouped and then allocated to coronas. We also cluster APs into groups, and schedule available channels to avoid radio interference and multi-channel hidden terminal problems among adjacent AP groups and among APs in a group. Simulation results show that the COMAS can effectively improve wireless-network throughput, drop rate, packet delivery delay and jitter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a new type of composites structural insulated panels (CSIPs) for structural wall applications. The proposed composite panel is made of low-cost thermoplastic orthotropic glass/poly-propylene (glass-PP) laminate as a facesheet and expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) as a core with very high facesheet/core moduli ratio. The proposed CSIP walls are intended to overcome problems of traditional Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) such as termite attack, mold buildups and poor penetration resistance against wind borne debris. This paper investigates the behavior of CSIPs under concentric and eccentric loading. CSIPs specimens failed by global buckling mode in which no debonding was observed. The eccentric specimens failed at load 35% lower than that of the concentric ones. Global buckling formulas for concentric and eccentric loading were presented and validated using the experimental results and were in a good agreement. An equivalent stiffness formula was also developed for sandwich wall under in-plane loading considering the shear deformations effect of the core. Design study for CSIP walls is also presented to help in designing this new type of composite panels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Higher Diptera (Schizophora) are taxonomically and ecologically diverse, and include bog specialist and bog-associated species known to respond to peatland disturbance. We examined the effects of three factors (habitat size, vegetation cover and surrounding land use measured in concentric circles of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 m radii from the sampling location) on Schizophora species richness, diversity, and composition in six temperate eastern Nearctic bogs. A total of 381 species of Schizophora were collected with observed species richness among sites ranging from 96 to 182. Assemblages in apparently similar peatlands were highly variable, but characterized by a few highly dominant species, most of which are not peatland specialists. Bog size had no influence on species richness or diversity. Vegetation cover at the sampling sites and surrounding land use at the largest scales measured (1500 and 2000 m) both influenced species assemblages.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an eccentric hamstring specific training programme on the percentage of bilateral muscle strength imbalance and maximal vertical jump height. Twenty-four, injury free female rugby union players took part in this study. Participants were split into two groups; intervention group (Nordic Hamstring (NH) (n = 13) and control group (n = 11)). Both groups completed normal training; the NH group completed a concurrent NH programme for 10 weeks. Pre and post-training concentric/concentric isokinetic testing of peak torque was performed for hamstrings of both legs at 60 degrees/s. Vertical jump height was also assessed. In the NH group, there was a significant decrease in mean percentage bilateral hamstring strength imbalance (pre = 10.39 +/- 3.53, post = 4.63 +/- 2.81, p < 0.05). There was also a significant increase in vertical jump height for the NH group (pre = 31.22 +/- 4.8 cm, post = 35.93 +/- 4.5 cm, p < 0.05). The NH programme caused favourable adaptations to bilateral hamstring strength imbalance and dynamic lower body performance. A programme based on NH exercise is potentially an effective preventive and rehabilitation tool for hamstring injury.

AB  - In this paper, free convection heat transfer between two elliptical cylinders having different elliptical ratios in blunt and slender situations was studied experimentally. Three pairs of elliptical cylinders having the same radius ratio of 2.0, the same surface area and different elliptical ratios of 0.662, 0.866 and 0.968 were cut using the computed numerically controlled wire-cut machining. The tests were carried out by keeping a constant heat flux on the inner cylinder while cooling the outer one to be isothermal. The effects of vertical eccentricity, lateral eccentricity, angle of attack of the inner cylinder on natural convection for both blunt and slender situations of each pair were investigated. Empirical correlation was deduced within an acceptable uncertainty for the experimental results. Compatible and satisfactory to the conscience agreement was found in the comparison among the results of present and previous works. In the vision of the comparison, it was found that; the vertical eccentricity can enhance free convection by about 15% than the concentric case, the horizontal eccentricity can enhance natural convection by about 10% than concentric case and slender situation offers about 40% enhancement in free convection than the blunt situation for the same elliptical ratio.

AB  - Enclosures around single-settlement sites are the products of the countryside rangeland contract system in China, and their recent establishment allows for the investigation of grazing gradients and corresponding rangeland degradation from single focal points. In the present study, which was conducted in an enclosure around a single settlement site in a semi-arid Leymus chinensis-dominated steppe area within the Xilingol Steppe, we analyzed vegetation changes at five distances (concentric half-circles at 250-m intervals that radiated out from the settlement). Our results show a clear trend in small-scale vegetation changes. Based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), the five stages of vegetative degradation from the least to the most degraded were identified in the following order: L. chinensis, L. chinensis + S. grandis. L. chinensis + C. squarrosa (A. cristatum), P. acaulis + A. frigida and A. frigida. Based on indicator species and their above-ground biomass changes, the decreasing rates of the total above-ground biomass in the five stages were 51.5, 50.9, 41.6, 30.2 and 35.9%, respectively, in comparison to the baseline biomasses of selected non-degraded communities. These data indicate that the degradation gradient attenuated from medium to slight as the distance from the settlement in the enclosure increased. This research provides deeper insight into grazing and degradation patterns and processes in enclosures around single settlement sites and reveals that herder-related participatory recovery measures need to be implemented by local rangeland management departments to prevent further land deterioration or an acceleration of currently observed degradation patterns.

AB  - Hamstring injuries are common in many sports involving high-load eccentric hamstring activation, including Gaelic football. Eccentric hamstring peak torque (PT) and hamstring angle to peak torque (AngPT) have not been examined in previously injured Gaelic footballers. This study aimed to determine whether significant hamstring and quadriceps PT deficits were present in Gaelic footballers after a hamstring injury. Concentric hamstring and quadriceps PT at 60 and 180 degrees/second (degrees/s) and eccentric hamstring PT at 30 degrees/s were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer in 18 male Gaelic footballers (nine previously injured, nine controls). Hamstring AngPT, as well as hamstring and quadriceps PT and PT ratios were analysed. For previously injured limbs, hamstring AngPT occurred at significantly shorter muscle lengths (p = 0.038) than for the contralateral uninjured limbs in eccentric testing only. There were no other significant differences (p > 0.05) at any velocity, for within-subject or between-subject comparisons. The results showed that the previously injured hamstrings generated their eccentric hamstring AngPT at significantly shorter muscle lengths than the contralateral hamstrings. The results imply footballers with a previous hamstring injury who have returned to full participation may remain at increased risk of re-injury because of an alteration in their eccentric hamstring AngPT.

AB  - In insects the antennal lobes (AL) constitute the brain deutocerebrum. In bees they consist of two neuropil regions, each associated with one antenna, delimited by a layer of glial cells and somata of neurons. The neuropil is organized in distinct globular structures of dense synaptic axons coming from the olfactory organs of the antennae, known as glomeruli. In Apis mellifera, as in other eusocial species of bees, queens, workers, and drones perform different functions in the colony and consequently the organs associated with these functions undergo a differential development. In this paper we analyzed the structure and size of the differentiating AL of queens, workers, and drones during metamorphosis using light microscopy. During metamorphosis the neuropil enlarge and differentiates into concentric structures known as glomeruli. The results showed size, structural and temporal differences in the glomeruli development among the classes of individuals of the colony. The neuropil differentiation starts early and is faster in drones and newly emerged worker is the colony individual class with greater neuropil area in AL. These results are discussed taking in account the functions of the individuals in the colony. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011.

AB  - Objective: To compare knee extension-flexion isokinetic performance between elite swimmers of simultaneous (SS butterfly and breaststroke) and alternated swimming (AS - front crawl and backstroke) styles.
   Method: Nineteen short distance elite swimmers (50 m, 100 m and 200 m events), divided into SS (n = 7; 23.3 +/- 5.6 years) and AS (n = 12; 22.6 +/- 1.4 years) were tested for knee extension-flexion isokinetic strength at 60 degrees/s (4 repetitions) and endurance at 300 degrees/s (30 repetitions).
   Results: There were no significant differences between groups or legs for concentric knee extension and flexion variables. However, the agonist/antagonist (HQ) ratio was lower (p = 0.032) in AS than SS group for both legs.
   Conclusion: These results indicate the need for training programs to improve strength balance between hamstrings and quadriceps muscles in short distance elite swimmers.

AB  - Seismic performance of a 3-story single-bay full-scale buckling-restrained braced frame (BRBF) specimen and a 3-story single-bay full-scale special concentrically braced frame (SCBF) specimen were evaluated by hybrid tests at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering. The BRBF specimen adopted two newly developed buckling-restrained braces (BRB) including the thin and end-slotted BRBs. The 10/50 LA03 earthquake with peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 530gal was applied for two BRBF hybrid tests. During the tests, the inter-story drifts reached about 0.03 radians for the 1(St) and 2(nd) stories. One of the thin BRB steel casings in the 1(st) story local bulged out in the first hybrid test. In the second hybrid test, the 1(St) story BRB specimens were replaced with new ones using thicker steel tubes and worked properly. It is illustrated that the local bulging failure of the steel casing can be prevented if the steel casing is properly designed. This paper presents the BRBF and SCBF specimens' experimental responses and concludes with the seismic design of the thin BRB to prevent local bulging failure.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that wearing a patellofemoral brace during strenuous training resulted in a decreased incidence of anterior knee pain (AKP). However whether this effect is derived from quadriceps enhancement remains unknown.
   Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Methods: Ninety-eight military recruits, 35 'with-brace' and 63 without, underwent concentric isokinetic tests at 60 and 240 degrees/s of the quadriceps prior to and following a 6-week basic military training (BMT). The randomly selected 35 subjects 'with brace' received a pair of patellofemoral braces (On-Track, DJ Ortho) and were instructed to wear these braces throughout training.
   Results: Baseline strength characteristics of the quadriceps were not significantly different between the braced and non-braced group (p > 0.05). No significant time-effect was observed in the braced group. There was a significant decrease in quadriceps strength at 60 degrees/s after BMT in the non-braced subjects (p < 0.001) while at this speed these subjects had a significantly (p = 0.02) lower strength compared to their non-braced counterparts.
   Conclusion: Patellofemoral bracing may be effective in preventing a decrease in quadriceps strength after prolonged strenuous training.

AB  - The current large-eddy simulation (LES) research makes use of the contravariant components as the dependent variables on a staggered grid system for the discretisation of the governing equations in curvilinear coordinates. This technology provides a possibility to investigate efficiently turbulent flows in complex geometries. To test and validate the recently developed in-house LES code, LESSGA (Large-Eddy Simulation on a Staggered Grid Arrangement), numerical simulations were performed for turbulent flows in a concentric annular pipe and transitional flows past an airfoil. In this article, the computed results of flows in a concentric annular pipe with a radius ratio of a=Rinner/Router=0.5 at [image omitted] and flows past an SD7003 airfoil at Rec=60,000 and angle of attack =4 degrees are compared with available experimental and DNS data. Technical difficulties experienced are also discussed.

AB  - Aim. Soccer players possess various degrees of functional footedness. Their lower limbs are subjected to consistent asymmetrical workloads and neuromuscular adaptations, and as a result develop asymmetrical patterns of musculoskeletal function. This study focused on the myodynamic profile of the knee and ankle joint in professional soccer players. Special emphasis was put on the multivariate quantification of three types of asymmetry: directional (left vs. right), fluctuating (dominant vs. non dominant) and absolute (left vs. right).
   Methods. One-hundred professional soccer players (mean age 23.4 years, weight 73.3, height 177.6) were tested isokinetically for concentric and eccentric isokinetic muscle strength (1) of the knee flexors and extensors, and (2) of the ankle dorsal and plantar flexors. Knee flexion-extension was tested at 60 degrees, 180 degrees and 300 degrees/s for the concentric mode of contraction and at 60 degrees and 180 degrees/s for the eccentric. The ankle joint was tested only at 60 degrees/s for both the concentric and eccentric action.
   Results. MANOVA showed significances for all three types of strength asymmetry (joint and action combined): directional (Wilks' Lambda=0.66, F=2.957, P=0.001), fluctuating (Wilks' Lambda=0.611, F=2.957, P=0.007), and absolute asymmetry (Wilks' Lambda=0.47, F=116.26, P=0.000). Several significant asymmetries were also revealed at the univariate level of analysis (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion. It seems that the lower limbs of professional soccer players are characterized by significant compound muscle strength asymmetries. These findings substantiate the idea of asymmetry in the myodynamic adaptations that take place at the knee and ankle joint of soccer players during the game. Individual modification of the training load, targeting in strength asymmetry correction, should be taken into consideration for injury prevention.

AB  - Groin injuries cause major problems in sports and particularly in football. Exercise is effective in treating adductor-related groin pain, but no trials have been published regarding the specific prevention of groin pain or prevention specifically targeting overuse injuries in sport using exercise programs. We performed a cluster-randomized trial including 55 football clubs representing 1211 players. The clubs were randomized to an exercise program aimed at preventing groin injuries (n=27) or to a control group training as usual (n=28). The intervention program consisted of six exercises including strengthening (concentric and eccentric), coordination, and core stability exercises for the muscles related to the pelvis. Physiotherapists assigned to each club registered all groin injuries. Twenty-two clubs in each group completed the study, represented by 977 players. There was no significant effect of the intervention (HR=0.69, 95% CI 0.40-1.19). The risk of a groin injury was reduced by 31%, but this reduction was not significant. A univariate analysis showed that having had a previous groin injury almost doubles the risk of developing a new groin injury and playing at a higher level almost triples the risk of developing a groin injury.

AB  - The geometric pattern of Amsterdam's canals was iconic of its nineteenth-century social order. The spider's web of canals fanned out along the Amstel river in concentric rings, its barge traffic linking the city to its hinterland, the province of Holland, and to the wider Netherlands of which it is the nominal capital. These canals divided the "Veniceof the North" into ninety islands linked by more than a thousand bridges. Imposing aristocratic and merchant houses stretched along the innermost canal ring, the Golden Curve of the Gentleman's Canal. At the center of the web lay de Dam, the 200 m long market square built on the first medieval dike protecting the city from the encroaching sea. The three pillars of the Dutch state framed the market square: the Royal Palace of the Merchant King, the Dutch Reformed New Church, and in the nineteenth century, the Amsterdam stock market, the world's oldest exchange. By the century's end, the site of the stock exchange was to become Industria, the majestic home of the Industrialist Great Club. This article traces the transformation of these aristocratic financiers into Saint-Simonian-inspired industrialists under the leadership of their Merchant King over the course of the nineteenth century, as they replaced this network of canals with an equally dense national network of railways. These gentlemanly capitalists staged a "coup d'corporation." Legitimated by a technocratic ideology they co-opted the corporate form utilized by the Crown to rule while avoiding parliamentary oversight, and thereby shifted the Dutch state from autocracy to oligarchy.

AB  - A push-pull sampling system interfaced on-line to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for micro-volume real-time monitoring of reaction mixtures The device consists of concentric tubes wherein sample was continuously withdrawn through the outer tube and reaction quenchant continuously delivered through a recessed inner tube The device allowed sampling rates of 0 1-60 mu L/min from a reaction vessel and stopped the reaction by passive mixing with quenchant to preserve the conditions observed in the reaction vessel A finite element model of the system showed that reaction mixtures could be completely mixed with quenchant within 43 s at a flow rate of 1 0 mu L/min The model also showed that an offset distance of 1 mm between the push capillary and sample capillary tips is sufficient to avoid leakage of quenchant/diluent into the bulk sample for push flow rates up to 95% of the pull flow rate The maximum relative push flow rate was determined to be 90% of the pull flow rate experimentally Delay between sampling and delivery to the HPLC was from 111 +/- 3 s to 317 +/- 9s for pull flow rates from 1 0 to 3 0 mu L/min in agreement with expected delays based on tubing volume Response times were from 27 +/- 1 s to 52 +/- 6 s over the same flow rate range The sampler was tested to determine the effects of sample viscosity The sampler was also used to demonstrate periodic sampling capabilities As a test of the system it was used to monitor the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of aspirin for 1 5 h demonstrating its utility for monitoring an ongoing reaction (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - Effect of stimulus opening size in global dominance with orientation classification task. The aims of this study is to examine whether global dominance depends on the opening size of the stimulus with concentric hierarchical figures and orientation classification task and to determine the role of the salience of global opening and its coincidence with vertical symmetry axis of context. In the first experiment, participants had to indicate the opening direction of stimuli, which were open-left and open-right figures. Three openings were included: 10, 25 and 50% of the total circle perimeter. The results showed a local advantage with stimuli of 10%, absence of global or local advantage with stimuli of 25% and global advantage with stimuli of 50%. In the second experiment. stimuli with an opening of 50% were presented randomly in several positions in the visual field in order to avoid the coincidence of global opening with the vertical symmetry axis of context. The results showed an absence of global or local advantage. These findings indicate that global dominance with orientation classification task depends on stimulus characteristics such as opening size, and strategies used in visual recognition.

AB  - A bronze fibula in the form of a bird (length: 5,3 cm; width: 1,1 cm at the tale, 0.9 cm at the front of the body; height: 1.5 cm at the needle's leg) was accidentally found at the site of Sladinac in Bacina, a border settlement of the upper Makarska coastline near the lakes at Ploce . The setting was not preserved, and the corroded thread was made of iron. The elongated bird's body has an emphasized ridge, thus giving the fibula a trapezoid cross section. The bird's head, curved beak, and dominant eyes - two incised circles inserted one into another - within the circular head section, show that the fibula was additionally processed.
   Analogies to this fibula are found in northern Dalmatia and the coastal hinterland. A similar specimen was found in Novalja on the island of Pag, with two bulges on the neck and the tail decoration not present in the Sladinac specimen. The Novalja fibula's bird does not have a pronounced beak, but the solution employed for the execution of round head and eyes are the same. Both fibulas belong to the same type of bird with folded wings. The Novalja fibula can be dated to the 5th-6th c., which also applies to the silver fibula of the same type from a tumulus on Skornica (Privlaka) near Nin, closer to the Novalja example, but with a richer ornamentation of the tale. It is dated to the 6th c., analogous with the specimens from Mogorjelo and Mazlum near Gacko (BiH), placed in a somewhat wider time frame (4th-7th c.). The Sladinac fibula is more similar in form to the coastal examples. It is similar to the Skornice fibula with regards to the cross section of the body, that is, the pronounced ridge. But the closest analogy to the Sladinac fibula is the one from Rotimlja near Stolac, alto dated from the 4th to the 7th c.
   Two accidentally found birdlike fibulae from the Sibenik hinterland are also analogous to the Sladinac fibula. The one from Danilo has a round head whose outline ends in a curved beak, while the front part of the body, "the breast", is bulged. Other marks are typical for this type of fibulae eyes as concentric circles and ribs on the join of the decorated tail and body. It is analogous to the Pudumci fibula through the outline of the head made as a segment of a circle. The discussion of the Sibenik hinterland and the Sladinac examples also includes the analogous Langobardic fibulae from the Apennine peninsula (late 6th-7th c.). A fibula from an unknown site, now in the Museo Civico in Bologna, is the one most similar to the Sladinac example, and its tail is almost in line with its body. The fibula from the Donicko brdo in Serbia, inconvincibly dated to a later period of the Middle Ages, is similar to the Sladinac fibula in its inconspicuous front part.
   One specimen of birdlike fibulae from Sisak is dated to the 4th-5th c., and others to the 5th. The somewhat earlier fibula appears more "classical" in form, which is uncharacteristic for the barbarian taste, and so these finds are interpreted as of an autochthon origin.
   It is obvious that the birdlike plastic fibula from Sladinac in Bacina cannot be securely dated to the turbulent intermediate period of the 4th/5th-7th c. Besides, the analysis of analogies raised some uncertainties, such as the retrospective dating of the Salona fibula to the 5th or 6th c., previously dated to the 2nd. The later date was not inferred from the characteristics of style - concentric circles on the bird's tail, which could be fitted into the appearance of a miscellaneous Late Antiquity material.
   A methodological inconsistency in a discussion on the well-known birdlike fibulae from the Bosnia and Herzegovina Land museum in Sarajevo is glaringly obvious. We are referring to an objection to the 2nd-c. dating. A lack of references supporting a later date is rather strange, and it is now regarded as something almost extraordinary. This kind of latent indifference in dating of the birdlike fibulae from the Bosnia and Herzegovina Land museum makes a chronological connection of the Grude near Ljubuski specimen with the Sladinac fibula very hard, and this connection is supported by a very similar acute break of the figure outline and the marking of birds' eyes with larger circles.
   A circular fibula from Podumci in the Sibenik hinterland (late 5th-first half of the 6th c.) has four bird's heads very similar to the bird's head on the Sladinac specimen. The greatest similarity lies in the curved beak and the dominant circle of head and eyes, despite the former being of a different type and being affiliated to a Germanic ethnic. This makes a similar chronological context of Eastern Gothic supremacy possible in the case of the Sladinac fibula too.
   The Late Antiquity fibula from Sladinac in Bacina cannot be securely associated with a destroyed grave. The area encompassing the Early Christian church of St Andrew had a role as a cemetery, and the origin of the fibula should be looked for in this context. The level of devastation of the site is signified by the destruction of a large cemetery with marbles during the construction of the Adriatic highway (in 1930s), but also later, and the devastations also destroyed an earlier layer of cemetery. A secure burial spot - besides the graves of the Early Christian church of St Andrew with its burial complex - was a Late Antiquity burial covered with tegulae in two canopies, some 80 m to the south of the spot where the fibula was found, some 10 m above the Adriatic highway, and somewhat more distant from the church remains. The complexity of the situation is apparent in the secure presence of a burial area on this site, with architectural remains and parts of Roman sculpture being found - but not investigated - during the road construction. The construction of the church of St Andrew took place from the late 5th to the early 6th c., as determined by the characteristics of the sculpture. Considering the above, we might date the Sladinac fibula to the period from the 5th to the 7th c., which corresponds to the time frame of analogous examples, and is almost contemporaneous with the construction of the St Andrew's church (late 5th or early 6th c.). It is most probable that the fibula had a burial character with a clear Christian meaning for the person buried within the church's perimeter. A touch of certain Germanic demands could be added to what is an undoubtedly Romanic origin of the fibula, especially with regards to the fibula's form. These are for the time being subtly suggested by a diversity of details in the same type of fibula within the discussed specimens. But material evidence for this fact within a wholesale appearance of a Late Antiquity cemetery in Sladinac is lacking, as well as a faithful image of the site's ethnic composition.

AB  - Background: Despite early recognition and appropriate treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip, there are a number of cases that subsequently require further surgery to prevent progressive dysplasia, instability, and eventual early osteoarthritis. This study aimed (1) to determine the incidence of pelvic osteotomy (PO) after late open (OR) or closed (CR) reduction for failed initial conservative treatment or late presentation; (2) study potential radiologic predictors of those that will require a secondary procedure; (3) and to evaluate the effect of potential confounding variables including age of reduction, Pavlik harness treatment, and surgical experience on PO rate.
   Methods: All cases of congenital dislocation of the hip that presented late or had failed conservative treatment with subsequent late OR versus CR, that were carried out during 1988 to 2003, by the lead surgeon were included. Dislocations secondary to neuromuscular causes or teratologic causes were excluded. Intraoperative arthrograms confirmed the concentric or eccentric reduction and determined subsequent intervention. The AP pelvis plain radiograph was used to measure the height of dislocation, as described by Tonnis, and monitor Acetabular index, and ossific nucleus width and height postreduction.
   Results: After 134 OR's, 24 hips (19%, 95% CI: 16-23%) later required a pelvic osteotomy compared with 59 out of 104 hips (58%, 95% CI: 49-68%) in the CR cohort. There was no statistical difference in avascular necrosis rates between late OR (10.9%, 95% CI: 4.8-17%) and CR (11.4%, 95% CI: 5.8-17%). Acetabular index was a reliable predictor for the need of subsequent PO becoming significantly different in those that did (PO group) and did not (non-PO group) require further surgery approximately 1.5 years postreduction. There was no difference in the ON development after reduction in both PO and non-PO groups. The PO requirement was not affected by earlier failed Pavlik harness treatment but did change with ongoing surgical experience. Late OR produced the lowest secondary procedure rate without an increase in the incidence of avascular necrosis. There is a learning curve to this procedure that will affect these outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: The use of dual mobility cups is an effective method to prevent dislocations. However, the specific design of these implants can raise the suspicion of increased wear and subsequent periprosthetic osteolysis.
   Hypothesis: Using radiostereometric analysis (RSA), migration of the femoral head inside the cup of a dual mobility implant can be defined to apprehend polyethylene wear rate.
   Study objectives: The study aimed to establish the precision of RSA measurement of femoral head migration in the cup of a dual mobility implant, and its intra- and interobserver variability.
   Material and methods: A total hip prosthesis phantom was implanted and placed under weight loading conditions in a simulator. Model-based RSA measurement of implant penetration involved specially machined polyethylene liners with increasing concentric wear (no wear, then 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mm). Three examiners, blinded to the level of wear, analyzed (10 times) the radiostereometric films of the four liners. There was one experienced, one trained, and one inexperienced examiner. Statistical analysis measured the accuracy, precision, and intra- and interobserver variability by calculating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), Intra Class correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots.
   Results: Our protocol, that used a simple geometric model rather than the manufacturer's CAD files, showed precision of 0.072mm and accuracy of 0.034mm, comparable with machining tolerances with low variability. Correlation between wear measurement and true value was excellent with a CCC of 0.9772. Intraobserver reproducibility was very good with an ICC of 0.9856, 0.9883 and 0.9842, respectively for examiners 1, 2 and 3. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent with a CCC of 0.9818 between examiners 2 and 1, and 0.9713 between examiners 3 and 1.
   Discussion: Quantification of wear is indispensable for the surveillance of dual mobility implants. This in vitro study validates our measurement method. Our results, and comparison with other studies using different measurement technologies (RSA, standard radiographs, Martell method) make model-based RSA the reference method for measuring the wear of total hip prostheses in vivo.

AB  - Kicking and cutting skills in soccer are clearly unilateral, require asymmetrical motor patterns and lead to the development of asymmetrical adaptations in the musculoskeletal function of the lower limbs. Assuming that these adaptations constitute a chronicity-dependent process, this study examined the effects of professional training age (PTA) on the composite strength profile of the knee and ankle joint in soccer players. One hundred soccer players (n = 100) with short (5-7 years), intermediate (8-10 years) and long (> 11 years) PTA were tested bilaterally for isokinetic concentric and eccentric strength of the knee and ankle muscles. Knee flexion-extension was tested concentrically at 60 degrees, 180 degrees and 300 degrees/sec and eccentrically at 60 degrees and 180 degrees/sec. Ankle dorsal and plantar flexions were tested at 60 degrees/sec for both the concentric and eccentric mode of action. Bilaterally averaged muscle strength [(R+L)/2] increased significantly from short training age to intermediate and stabilized afterwards. These strength adaptations were mainly observed at the concentric function of knee extensors at 60 degrees/sec (p = 0.023), knee flexors at 60 degrees/sec (p = 0.042) and 180 degrees/sec (p = 0.036), and ankle plantar flexors at 60 degrees/sec (p = 0.044). A linear trend of increase in isokinetic strength with PTA level was observed for the eccentric strength of knee flexors at 60 /sec (p = 0.02) and 180 degrees/sec (p = 0.03). Directional (R/L) asymmetries decreased with PTA, with this being mainly expressed in the concentric function of knee flexors at 180 degrees/sec (p = 0.04) and at 300 degrees/sec (p = 0.03). These findings confirm the hypothesis of asymmetry in the strength adaptations that take place at the knee and ankle joint of soccer players mainly along with short and intermediate PTA. Players with a longer PTA seem to adopt a more balanced use of their lower extremities to cope with previously developed musculoskeletal asymmetries and possibly reduce injury risk. This has certain implications regarding proper training and injury prevention in relation to professional experience in soccer.

AB  - Although some nymphalid butterflies have been intensively used to study mechanisms of the colour pattern formation on butterfly wings, lycaenid butterflies are equally attractive, having easily identifiable distinct spot patterns and highly diverse colour patterns among species. To establish a lycaenid model system for physiological and genetic experiments, we here describe a series of methods for rearing the Japanese pale grass blue Zizeeria maha (Kollar) (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) in a small laboratory space with an artificial diet for generations. Adult individuals readily mated and oviposited in a small cage with sufficient light, flowers, and host plants. Eggs were harvested in the cage, and larvae were successfully reared to normal adults with an artificial diet made from fresh leaves (AD-F), although they were smaller than those reared with a natural diet. Feeding an artificial diet made from dried leaves (AD-D) frequently produced adult individuals with aberrant wing colour patterns. Using our rearing methods, it is now possible to rear this species in a laboratory and to establish specific strains for physiological and genetic experiments on the wing colour pattern development, diversity, and evolution.

AB  - Aim. The lunge movement in fencing generates a different force to the two lower extremities. Knowledge of this difference holds importance for reducing the risk of injury, especially among young fencers. The aim of this study was to measure the forces generated to the lower limbs and to determine whether they differed by gender.
   Methods. The forces generated by the fencing lunge and the countermovement jump were measured using two force platforms and an accelerometer, supported by dedicated software for data analysis.
   Results. Statistically significant differences in peak concentric force and the ground reaction force emerged between the male and female fencers (P <0.05). Comparison of the values recorded for the two movements showed that values for the push leg differed on both the lunge (an asymmetrical movement) and the CM) (a symmetrical movement).
   Conclusion. Fencing is an asymmetrical sport that produces differences in neuromuscular and functional adaptations in the lower limbs which can influence strength and control demanded by the lunge movement. With muscle conditionning and specific training, this functional asymmetry can be reduced in fencers.

AB  - With the rapid growth of networked data communications in size and complexity, network administrators today are facing more challenges to protect their networked computers and devices from all kinds of attacks. This paper proposes a new concentric-circle visualization method for visualizing multi-dimensional network data. This method can be used to identify the main features of network attacks, such as DDoS attack, by displaying their recognizable visual patterns. To reduce the edge overlaps and crossings, we arrange multiple axes displayed as concentric circles rather than the traditional parallel lines. In our method, we use polycurves to link values (vertexes) rather than polylines used in parallel coordinate approach. Some heuristics are applied in our new method in order to improve the readability of views. We discuss the advantages as well as the limitations of our new method. In comparison with the parallel coordinate visualization, our approach can reduce more than 15% of the edge overlaps and crossings. In the second stage of the method, we have further enhanced the readability of views by increasing the edge crossing angle. Finally, we introduce our prototype system: a visual interactive network scan detection system called CCScanViewer. It is based on our new visualization approach and the experiments have showed that the new approach is effective in detecting attack features from a variety of networking patterns, such as the features of network scans and DDoS attacks.

AB  - The African butterfly Bicyclus anynana is an emerging model in evo-devo and eco-evo-devo. Much has been learned about the development, genetics, and evolution of wing eyespot patterns and about how seasonal polyphenism in this species provides an adaptive response to the wet-dry environments it inhabits. Recent work is also examining the role of male secondary sexual traits, the wing scent brushes, and associated sex pheromones in mate choice and sexual selection. However, B. anynana is but one member of a spectacular radiation amounting to some 250 extant species in the subtribe Mycalesina in the Old World tropics. Therefore, it is appropriate timing to consider whether the experimental work on a single species can help in analyzing pattern and process in the spectacular expansion of this whole clade of mycalesine butterflies. The most recent molecular phylogenetics (Kodandaramaiah et al. 2010) underpins the occurrence of several parallel geographical radiations on the African mainland, on Madagascar, and in Asia. Expansions of the mycalesine butterflies into more seasonal environments may have occurred in tandem with those of their larval host plants, the grasses, around 25 million years ago. This article examines how the findings from multidisciplinary work on B. anynana could be the basis for a comparative approach to unravel the processes of adaptation and speciation that have yielded patterns of occupancy of trait space in the mycalesines. The parallel nature of radiations in at least three geographical regions provides exceptional power for such an analysis. I argue that research on B. anynana has provided an invaluable backbone for such an endeavor by revealing candidate suites of traits involved in adaptation to new ecological opportunities and in the evolution of reproductive isolation.

AB  - Background: The ability to identify pitchers at risk for injury could be valuable to a professional baseball organization. To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies examining the predictive value of preseason strength measurements.
   Hypothesis: Preseason weakness of shoulder external rotators is associated with increased risk of in-season throwing-related injury in professional baseball pitchers.
   Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: Preseason shoulder strength was measured for all pitchers in a professional baseball organization over a 5-year period (2001-2005). Prone internal rotation (IR), prone external rotation (PER), seated external rotation (SER), and supraspinatus (SS) strength were tested during spring training before each season. The players were then prospectively followed throughout the season for incidence of throwing-related injury. Injuries were categorized on an ordinal scale, with no injury, injury treated conservatively, and injury resulting in surgery delineated 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Subset analyses of shoulder injuries and of players with prior surgery were also performed. The association between strength measurements and injury was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation.
   Results: A statistically significant association was observed for PER strength (P=.003), SEA strength (P=.048), and SS strength (P=.006) with throwing-related injury requiring surgical intervention. Supraspinatus strength was also significantly associated with incidence of any shoulder injury (P=.031). There was an association between the ratio of PER/IR strength and incidence of shoulder injury (P=.037) and some evidence for an association with overall incidence of throwing-related injury (P=.051). No associations were noted in the subgroup of players with prior surgery.
   Conclusion: Preseason weakness of external rotation and SS strength is associated with in-season throwing-related injury resulting in surgical intervention in professional baseball pitchers. Thus, preseason strength data may help identify players at risk for injury and formulate strengthening plans for prevention.

AB  - Well-preserved pillow lavas in the uppermost part of the Early Archean volcanic sequence of the Hooggenoeg Formation in the Barberton Greenstone Belt exhibit pronounced flow banding. The banding is defined by mm to several cm thick alternations of pale green and a dark green, conspicuously variolitic variety of aphyric metabasalt. Concentrations of relatively immobile TiO2, Al2O3 and Cr in both varieties of lava are basaltic. Compositional differences between bands and variations in the lavas in general have been modified by alteration, but indicate mingling of two different basalts, one richer in TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, FeOt and probably Ni and Cr than the other, as the cause of the banding. The occurrence in certain pillows of blebs of dark metabasalt enclosed in pale green metabasalt, as well as cores of faintly banded or massive dark metabasalt, suggest that breakup into drops and slugs in the feeder channel to the lava flow initiated mingling. The inhomogeneous mixture was subsequently stretched and folded together during laminar shear flow through tubular pillows, while diffusion between bands led to partial homogenisation. The most common internal pattern defined by the flow banding in pillows is concentric. In some pillows the banding defines curious mushroom-like structures, commonly cored by dark, variolitic metabasalt, which we interpret as the result of secondary lateral flow due to counter-rotating, transverse (Dean) vortices induced by the axial flow of lava towards the flow front through bends, generally downward, in the tubular pillows. Other pillows exhibit weakly-banded or massive, dark, variolitic cores that are continuous with wedge-shaped apophyses and veins that intrude the flow banded carapace. These cores represent the flow of hotter and less viscous slugs of the dark lava type into cooled and stiffened pillows.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 42, No. 6, pp. 1209-1214, 2010. Purpose: This study analyzed changes in neuromuscular, body composition, and endurance markers during 4 wk of tapering and subsequent 5 wk of reduced training (RT) or training cessation (TC). Methods: Fourteen world-class kayakers were randomly assigned to either a TC (n = 7) or an RT group (n = 7). One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength, mean concentric velocity with 45% 1RM (V-45%) in the bench press (BP) and prone bench pull (PBP) exercises, and body composition assessments were conducted at the start (T0) and end (T1) of a 43-wk training program, after tapering for the world championships (T2) and after TC or RT (T3). A graded exercise test on a kayak ergometer for determination of maximal oxygen uptake at T0, T1, and T3 was also performed. Results: After tapering, no significant changes were observed in 1RM or V-45%. TC resulted in significantly greater declines in 1RM strength (-8.9% and -7.8%, P < 0.05, respectively, for BP and PBP) than those observed for RT (-3.9% and -3.4%). Decreases in V-45% in BP and PBP were larger for TC (-12.6% and -10.0%) than for RT (-9.0% and -6.7%). Increases in sum of eight skinfolds were observed after both TC and RT, whereas declines in maximal aerobic power were lower for RT (-5.6%) than for TC (-11.3%). Conclusions: Short-term TC results in large decreases in maximal strength and especially V-45% in highly trained athletes. These results suggest the need of performing a minimal maintenance program to avoid excessive declines in neuromuscular function in cases where a prolonged break from training is required.

AB  - Measurements and predictions are made of a short-cowl coflowing jet with a bypass ratio of 8:1. The Reynolds number is 300,000, and the inlet Mach numbers are representative of aeroengine conditions. The low Reynolds number of the measurements makes the case well suited to the assessment of large-eddy-simulation-related strategies. The nozzle concentricity is carefully controlled to deal with the emerging metastability issues of jets with coflow. Measurements of mean quantities and turbulence statistics are made using both laser Doppler anemometry and particle image velocimetry. The simulations are completed on 6 x 10(6), 12 x 10(6), and 50 x 10(6) cell meshes. To overcome near-wall modeling problems, a hybrid large-eddy-simulation Reynolds-averaged-Navier Stokes-related method is used. The near-wall Reynolds-averaged-Navier Stokes layer is helpful in preventing nonphysical separation from the nozzle wall.

AB  - In this paper, a new technology for a tangential firing pulverized coal boiler, high efficiency and low NO, combustion technology with multiple air-staged and a large-angle counter flow fuel-rich jet (ACT for short) is proposed. To verify the characteristics of this technology, experiments of two combustion technologies, ACCT and CFS-1 (Concentric Firing System-1), are carried out under a cold model of a 1025 t/h tangential firing boiler with a PDA (particle dynamics anemometer). The distributions of velocity, particle concentration, particle diameters and the particle volume flux of primary air and secondary air are obtained. The results show that the fuel-rich primary air of ACCT can go deeper into the furnace and mix with the main flow better, which means that the counter flow of fuel-rich jets in ACCT can realize stable combustion, low NO(x) emission and slagging prevention.

AB  - This paper proposes a frequency compounding method to reduce speckle interferences, where a concentric annular type high-frequency dual element transducer is used to broaden the bandwidth of an imaging system. In frequency compounding methods, frequency division is carried out to obtain sub-band images containing uncorrelated speckles, which sacrifices axial resolution. Therefore, frequency compounding often deteriorates the target-detecting capability, quantified by the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), when the speckle's SNR (SSNR) is not improved as much as the degraded axial resolution. However, this could be avoided if the effective bandwidth required for frequency compounding is increased. The primary goal of the proposed approach, hence, is to improve SSNR by a factor of two under the condition where axial resolution is degraded by a factor of less than two, which indicates the total SNR improvement to higher than 40% compared to that of an original image. Since the method here employs a dual element transducer operating at 20 and 40 MHz, the effective bandwidth necessary for frequency compounding becomes broadened. By dividing each spectrum of RF samples from both elements into two sub-bands, this method eventually enables four sets of the sub-band samples to contain uncorrelated speckles. This causes the axial resolution to be reduced by a factor of as low as 1.85, which means that this method would improve total SNR by at least 47%. An in vitro experiment on an excised pig eye was performed to validate the proposed approach, and the results showed that the SSNR was improved from 2.081 +/- 0.365 in the original image to 4.206 +/- 0.635 in the final compounding image.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated the effects of a combined endurance and strength training on the physiological and neuromuscular parameters during a 2-h cycling test.
   Methods: Fourteen triathletes were assigned to an endurance-strength training group and an endurance-only training group. They performed three experimental trials before and after training: an incremental cycling test to exhaustion, a maximal concentric lower-limbs strength measurement and a 2-h cycling exercise. Physiological parameters, free cycling chosen cadence and the EMG of Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Rectus Femoris (RF) were analysed during the 2-h cycling task before and after a strength training programme of 5 weeks (three times per week).
   Results: The results showed that the maximum strength and the isometric maximal voluntary contraction (isoMVC) after training were significantly higher (P < 0.01) and lower (P < 0.01) than those before training, respectively, in endurance-strength training group and endurance-only group. The physiological variables measured during the cycling tests and the progressive increase (P < 0.01) in EMGi((VL)) and EMGi((RF)) throughout the 2-h cycling test did not differ between the two groups before and after training, except for the variation of EMGi((VL)) over the cycle time which was stabilized during the second hour of the 2-h cycling test due to training in endurance-strength training group. The decrease in free cycling chosen cadence observed in pre-training (P < 0.01) was also replaced by a steady free cycling chosen cadence for the endurance-strength training group during the second hour of exercise.
   Conclusion: This study confirmed the decrease in the free cycling chosen cadence with exercise duration and demonstrated that a specific combined endurance and strength training can prevent this decrease during a 2-h constant cycling exercise. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The use of a geographic information system to identify a dairy goat farm as the most likely source of an urban Q-fever outbreak
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA  - English
AB  - Background: A Q-fever outbreak occurred in an urban area in the south of the Netherlands in May 2008. The distribution and timing of cases suggested a common source. We studied the spatial relationship between the residence locations of human cases and nearby small ruminant farms, of which one dairy goat farm had experienced abortions due to Q-fever since mid April 2008. A generic geographic information system (GIS) was used to develop a method for source detection in the still evolving major epidemic of Q-fever in the Netherlands.
   Methods: All notified Q-fever cases in the area were interviewed. Postal codes of cases and of small ruminant farms (size >40 animals) located within 5 kilometres of the cluster area were geo-referenced as point locations in a GIS-model. For each farm, attack rates and relative risks were calculated for 5 concentric zones adding 1 kilometre at a time, using the 5-10 kilometres zone as reference. These data were linked to the results of veterinary investigations.
   Results: Persons living within 2 kilometres of an affected dairy goat farm (>400 animals) had a much higher risk for Q-fever than those living more than 5 kilometres away (Relative risk 31.1 [95% CI 16.4-59.1]).
   Conclusions: The study supported the hypothesis that a single dairy goat farm was the source of the human outbreak. GIS-based attack rate analysis is a promising tool for source detection in outbreaks of human Q-fever.

AB  - Introduction and purpose: The shoulder complex muscles play an important role in force, power and endurance production in volleyball, allowing the accomplishment of movement in a coordinated manner. The objective written account produced by isokinetic evaluations assists in the diagnosis and prevention of shoulder complex injuries. In addition, it is a useful tool in promoting safe and fast return of the injured athlete to sports practice. The purpose of this study was to analyze the isokinetic muscle performance of the lateral and medial rotators of the glenohumeral joint in Brazilian male volleyball teams (under-19 and under-21). Methods: The protocol used during the test included five maximum repetitions of shoulder lateral and medial rotation in concentric-concentric mode at 60 degrees/s and 30 repetitions at 360 degrees/s. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the dependent variables: maximum work and maximum torque of shoulder lateral and medial rotators normalized by body mass, antagonist/agonist ratio at the two speeds and muscular fatigue index. Results: Data analysis demonstrated an imbalance between the shoulder lateral and medial rotators (antagonist/agonist ratio) in the under-21 category of the Brazilian volleyball athletes, demonstrating relative weakness of the lateral rotators. Conclusion: It was possible to identify changes in volleyball players, which added to specific demands of the sport, can lead to symptoms in the shoulder complex and / or decrease of performance.

AB  - Objectives: Paraplegia remains a serious complication after endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms, and it has been reported that paraplegia might be due to ischemia of the artery of Adamkiewicz. This study investigates the feasibility of an Inoue stent graft with a side branch of a small caliber for the reconstruction of the intercostal artery branching the artery of Adamkiewicz.
   Methods: Branched Inoue stent grafts were implanted into the thoracic aorta and 11th intercostal artery of 5 mongrel dogs. The side branch measured 3 3 5 mm and contained a bare-metal coronary stent for fixing to the intercostal arterial wall. Aortography and selective angiography of the 11th intercostal artery were performed before and immediately after implantation and after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The luminal diameter of the intercostal artery before implantation was 2.4 +/- 0.3 mm.
   Results: All stent grafts were successfully deployed. The main body of the graft did not develop endoleak or migrate, and the side branch remained patent for 12 weeks. Angiography performed 1 week postoperatively revealed smooth flow with slight stenosis (4.2% +/- 1.7%) along the side branches and the intercostal arteries in all dogs. Four weeks postoperatively, however, mild concentric stenosis (38% +/- 16%) along the side branch was observed in 4 of the 5 dogs. The percent stenosis at 8 and 12 weeks was 38% +/- 15% and 33% +/- 11%, respectively; these values were not significantly different from the value at 4 postoperative weeks.
   Conclusions: A novel Inoue stent graft with a side branch of small caliber was successfully deployed into the canine thoracic aorta and intercostal artery; the side branch remained patent for 12 weeks. This novel technique may enable endovascular reconstruction of the Adamkiewicz artery. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2010; 139: 655-9)

   Main outcome measures: Strength variables of external (ER) and internal rotators (IR) in concentric and eccentric modes were considered. For the peak torque functional ratio, the eccentric strength of the ER and the concentric strength of the IR were calculated.
   Results: All variables related to IR were significantly higher on the dominant compared to the non-dominant side in males and females (p < 0.05), but only boys exhibited this dominance effect in ER (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001). Regarding functional ratios, they were significantly lower for the dominant shoulder (p < 0.001) and below 1.00 for both groups, indicating that the eccentric strength of the ER was not greater than the concentric strength of the IR.
   Conclusion: Elite junior tennis players without shoulder injury have Shoulder rotation muscle strength imbalances that alter the normal functional ratio between rotator cuff muscles, Although these differences do nor seem to affect the athletic performance, detection and prevention with exercise programs at an early age are recommended.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish the isokinetic profile of shoulder rotator muscles strength in female handball players. Twenty-seven handball players performed concentric and eccentric strength tests of both dominant and non-dominant upper limbs on an isokinetic dynamometer. Internal and external rotator muscles peak torque was assessed at 1.05, 3.14, and 5.23 rad center dot s-1 in concentric mode and at 3.14 and 5.23 rad center dot s-1 in eccentric mode. Concentric balance ratio and functional ratio were obtained. Bi-lateral deficiency was compared. Concentric strength for internal and external rotation was significantly greater for the dominant than for the non-dominant limb for all speeds (P0.0001). For eccentric actions, internal rotator muscles were stronger in the dominant than the non-dominant limb (P0.0001) at both speeds. Concentric balance and functional balance ratios did not differ between sides at 3.14 rad center dot s-1 (P=0.1631), but at 5.23 rad center dot s-1 the functional balance ratio in the dominant limb was lower than for the non-dominant limb (P=0.0500). Although the dominant side was stronger than the non-dominant side, balance concentric ratios remained the same, with only the functional strength ratio different at 5.23 rad center dot s-1. Our results suggest that concentric strength exercises be used for internal and external rotators on the non-dominant side, and functional exercise that improves eccentric rotation strength for prevention programmes.

TI  - FACTION STRUGGLE IN LATE-MEDIEVAL FLANDERS
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR GESCHIEDENIS
LA  - German
AB  - During the Late Middle Ages, faction formation in Flemish cities was largely determined by both international and local political and socio-economic relationships or oppositions and conflicts concerning honour and interests between rivalling elite networks. The 'factions' of the Flemish patricians often had a concentric pattern, with a core usually closely interconnected by means of family ties and a sympathising periphery, supporting the core for economic, political, or ideological reasons. The reasons why corporative middle groups supported factions are sometimes hard to fathom. The sources show that patrician factions often feared the middle classes and manual workers. These were able to punish newly elected leaders severely if they did not live up to their sometimes great expectations. The stakes of such conflicts were high, which probably explains their intensity as well as the increasingly frequent interventions by the state. Although the growing political influence of the Burgundian dynasty in the urban faction struggle in Flanders must be recognized, it can be disputed whether growing state power ensured less 'private violence'. On the contrary, it seems that the Dukes often consciously 'participated' in faction struggles in order to reinforce sovereign power in the city.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether FIFA'sMedical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) injury prevention programme, "The 11+", improves isokinetic strength of the knee extensor and flexor muscles in sub-elite soccer players. Twenty players aged 22.3 +/- 4.2 yr performed "The 11+" 3 times a week for 10 weeks. Isokinetic measurements were performed on the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles on both lower extremities at concentric 60 and 180 degrees/s and eccentric 30 degrees/s. The peak torque (PT) as well as conventional and dynamic control ratios (DCR) were calculated. Hamstrings PT in the non-dominant limb increased by 14.6%, 15.0% and 14.3% during the above contractions/velocities, respectively (p < 0.05). In the dominant limb the concentric PT of the quadriceps increased by 6.9% (60 degrees/s) and 8.3% (180 degrees/s) whereas that of the hamstring increased by 20.4% (60 degrees/s), (p < 0.05). The training programme significantly improved the conventional H/Q ratio at 60 degrees/s by 14.8% and the DCR by 13.8% in the non-dominant limb (p < 0.05). Therefore, the "The 11+" training programme appears to be adequate and effective for soccer training and conditioning by improving strength and muscle balance around the knee joint.

AB  - Endoluminal therapy is indicated in lower extremity ischaemia with Fontaine grades IIb, III and IV. In the presence of significant limitations, interventions are carried out even in grade IIa claudicants. In addition to the TASC A and B lesions, TASC C and D lesions are increasingly being treated endoluminally as well. Presently, technical success rates of revascularization procedures are above 90% in the iliac vessels and between 79% and 95% in the femoro-popliteal segments.
   Concentric, non-calcified iliac stenoses are primarily treated with balloon angioplasty (PTA) followed by optional stenting when necessary. For occlusions and heavily calcified lesions, primary stenting is recommended.
   Primary PTA is the mainstay of treatment in femoro-popliteal vessels with stents being used as a "bail-out" option in case of suboptimal PTA. However, initial reports proving the superiority of primary stenting over PTA with optional stenting have already appeared. Results of PTA with drug-coated balloons for prevention of early restenosis are promising. In the near future, primary PTA with optional stenting in the femoro-popliteal segments may give way to drug-coated balloon angioplasty or primary stenting.

AB  - Sammon mapping is an approach of nonlinear dimension reduction and can be used for visualization. To avoid numerical complexity of the algorithm of traditional Sammon mapping, Kovacs and Abonyi (2004) proposed a modified Sammon mapping method. However, this improvement can only be applied to fuzzy clustering results. By using the property of Fermat point, we develop a new method in this article that can be applied to any clustering results. Different from other methods of visualization, we transfer information of clustering results into concentric circles around the Fermat points. So our procedure can demonstrate the data structure in a more informative way and the clustering results become easier to understand, especially for nonprofessionals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is studied by application to a real data in this article.

AB  - Knowledge of lower-extremity strength can be used in injury prevention, conditioning and rehabilitation of volleyball players. The goals were: (1) to describe the bilateral concentric and eccentric quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H) muscle function in volleyball players, (2) to evaluate the differences in Q and H strength, strength ratios and bilateral strength asymmetry among age groups, playing positions and playing levels, (3) to compare bilateral strength asymmetry in Q and H muscles in two different contraction modes. Ninety five professional male volleyball players were tested on an isokinetic machine at 60 degrees/s to assess concentric and eccentric Q and H strength. We also calculated strength ratios and bilateral strength asymmetries. MANOVAs indicated significant main effect of playing level on relative PT (p = 0.001) and strength ratios (p < 0.05). International-level players had significantly (p < 0.05) higher H strength and dynamic control ratio (DCR) of the right leg compared to the 1st and/or 2nd national division players. There were no signs of bilateral strength asymmetry regardless of muscle group tested and contraction mode. Our results suggest that right H strength and DCR could be important for successful volleyball performance. Descriptive data about Q and H muscle function can be used as guidelines for coaches and therapists during training and rehabilitation of male volleyball players.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of concentric warm-up exercise on eccentrically induced changes in muscle strength, range of motion, and soreness of the elbow flexors. Ten resistance-exercise naive participants performed intermittent incremental eccentric actions (42 in total) of the elbow flexor muscles of each arm to induce muscle damage. The arms of each participant were randomly assigned either to a pre-eccentric exercise warm-up involving intermittent concentric exercise (warm-up) or no prior exercise (control). Strength, range of motion, and ratings of soreness were recorded before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days after exercise. Strength, range of motion, and soreness during muscular movements changed over time (P at most 0.01; Cohen's d at least 0.51, medium). There was an interaction (P0.001) for strength, showing a smaller reduction after exercise for warm-up than control (P0.001, d=2.44, large effect). The decreased range of motion was less for warm-up than control for the arm while extended (P0.001), flexed (P=0.002), and relaxed (P=0.004). Muscle soreness was reduced for the warm-up group, while the muscle was flexed, extended, and relaxed compared with control (P0.001). The results demonstrate that a concentric warm-up exercise attenuates the reduction in loss of strength, range of motion, and muscle soreness after eccentric-exercise-induced muscle damage and might allow higher intensities of training to be performed.

AB  - In this paper, thermomechanical coupling analysis of two concentric cylinders with initial gap is investigated by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method. The thermomechanical coupling analysis is divided into a thermal subproblem and a mechanical subproblem in the sequencial coupling algorithm. The Picard iteration procedure with a relaxation technique is also employed to accelerate the rate of convergence of the iterative procedure and avoid numerical instability. Due to the existence of the thermal contact resistance (TCR) between these two cylinders, some interesting thermomechanical coupling phenomena appeared. It is found that a proper initial gap may greatly reduce the maximum equivalent stress in structures. Moreover, the DG finite element method not only can be used to simulate the thermomechanical coupling problems effectively, but also can find out this proper initial gap, which is valuable in engineering design and structural safety assessment.

AB  - Hamstring strains are common injuries in sports, especially in sprinting Through the analysis of the mechanisms of hamstring injury in running, the study was to design a specific training machine for hamstring, and to test the effects of 6 weeks' strength training program on knee joint strength as well as low extremities power output The designed machine may provide the athletes neuromuscular system, especially hamstrings, an opportunity to adapt to the training load as well as the mode which is analogous with the hamstring muscle action during sprinting 12 male subjects with no history of hamstring injury completed the training on the designed machine, 3x7 repetitions-3 times a week The comparison of results showed a significant increase in maximal isometric torque of hamstrings at knee position toward full extension but not flexion Both concentric and eccentric peak torque (PT) increased in hamstrings whereas only the eccentric PT rose in quadriceps Significant increase was also observed in vertical jump height These results suggest that 6 weeks of hamstrings strength training is sufficient to Improve the muscular strength which is beneficial for injury prevention

AB  - Stiffness control of a continuum robot can prevent excessive contact forces during robot navigation inside delicate, uncertain and confined environments. Furthermore, it enables the selection of tip stiffnesses that match varying task requirements. This paper introduces a computationally-efficient approach to continuum-robot stiffness control that is based on writing the forward kinematic model as the product of two transformations. The first transformation calculates the non-contact kinematics of the robot and can be formulated based on the specific type of continuum robot under consideration. The second transformation calculates the tip deflection due to applied forces and is efficiently computed using the special Cosserat rod model. To implement a desired tip stiffness, the two transformations are used to solve for the actuator positions that deform the manipulator so as to generate the required tip force at the measured tip position. The efficacy of the proposed controller is demonstrated experimentally on a concentric-tube continuum robot.

AB  - Attention of this paper is devoted to testing and evaluation of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer specimens with lock-in thermography. Several specimens were prepared by a vacuum infusion technique using a low-viscosity epoxy system; delaminated areas were simulated by the insertion of thin Kapton (R) diskettes at a given depth through the thickness. Artificial defects had different shapes (circular or elliptical) and dimensions. Inserts were located at different depths and, in some cases, by overlapping more than one Kapton (R)-shaped layer (i.e. two or more concentric discs, each of different diameter). A preliminary test campaign was performed by differential scanning calorimetry and rheometry to find optimal processing parameters to achieve fully cured state of matrix and to avoid the formation of defects in accordance with aerospace standards for composites manufacturing. Specimens were non-destructively inspected with optical lock-in thermography; results were presented in terms of phase images. All inserts were discovered and also well outlined under difficult conditions such as in the case of thin overlapped foils.

AB  - Mechanomyography (MMG) monitors the oscillations caused by muscle contraction. Muscle contractions generate motion artifacts which can significantly affect signal processing of MMG. In order to avoid such interference during signal analysis, one can respect a time delay (TD) after the onset of contraction (OC). This study aimed to identify wrist antagonist movements from signals recorded with MMG sensors. The distinction was performed after evaluating the correlation between windows of interest in signals between 0.2 s after OC (0.2 AOC) and 1.0 s after OC (1.0 AOC). Twelve volunteers performed concentric wrist contractions: flexion and ulnar deviation (inner side) and extension and radial deviation (outer side). Two triaxial MMG sensors were placed on the inner and outer sides of the forearm. The features used in the analysis of MMG signals were root mean square (RMS), number of zero-crossings, peak counting and the multiplication RMS times number of zero-crossings (RZ). Two analysis window lengths (0.25 s and 0.5 s) were evaluated. ANOVA tests indicated that flexion was different from extension, ulnar and radial deviation, and radial deviation was different from ulnar deviation and flexion. The results suggest that it is possible to identify whether the movements are antagonistic and to distinguish movements from the same side. There were strong correlations between the acquired signals and TD, mainly the devised RZ feature (0.81 similar to 0.95). This study proposed an approach to determine whether triaxial MMG features can be used for motor prosthesis control. The triaxial modulus presented strong correlations for all movements and can be useful in future applications.

AB  - One of the challenges in the production of electricity is the cooling water management because the calcium content in circulating cooling water continues to increase with time as pure water evaporates. Thus, the excessive mineral contents in water circulation systems could cause severe fouling in heat transfer equipment. To avoid the catastrophic failure in condensers, the cooling water is discharged after 3 cycles at a rate of 10 million gallons a day in a 1,000-MW thermoelectric power plant. The present study investigated the effect of pulsed spark discharges on the mitigation of mineral fouling in a concentric counterflow heat exchanger. Artificial hard water with calcium carbonate hardness ranging from 250 to 500 ppm was used with velocity varying over a range of 0.1 - 0.5 m/s and zero blowdown. Fouling resistances decreased by 50-88% for the plasma treated cases compared with the values for no-treatment cases. SEM photographs showed particle with larger sizes for the plasma treated cases comparing to smaller but more organized particles for the no-treatment cases. The different structures of particles were associated with pulsed spark discharge assisted precipitation of calcium carbonate in oversaturated hard water. X-ray diffraction data showed calcite crystal structures for all cases.

AB  - The ecosystem of wetlands has precious natural environment to be preserved in the world. In order to sustain valuable wetlands ecosystems for a long time, it is very important to frequently monitor the state of wetland ecosystems, to carefully watch the environment, and to earlier warn the environmental change. In this research, using high spatial resolution of color photographs taken with a 35 mm non-metric camera mounted on the cabled balloon flown over the high moor near Akanuma in Kushiro wetland, characteristics of spatial distribution of wetland plant communities are studied in terms of application and interpretation of remote sensing data for wetland environment monitoring using geostatistics, texture analysis, and landscape metrics.
   Outcomes of this research are summarized as follows.
   1. An ultra fine and reliable vegetation map, of which nominal spatial resolution is 2cm by 2cm, with 40 plant community types at the time of the summer in 1998 was originally created, which is covering about 15ha of the high moor, for the baseline map for ecological studies near Akanuma.
   2. The optimal spatial resolution for monitoring vegetation in this area by remote sensing is smaller than a half meter.
   3. Concentric spatial distribution of typical wetland plant community groups is clearly distinguished and confirmed in the ultra fine vegetation map through visual interpretation and spatial analysis using GIS application tools.
   4. Results of this research show that remote sensing of high spatial resolution greatly serves for wetland environment monitoring and wetland studies.

AB  - This paper proposes a new method called Concentric Coordinate for visualizing multidimensional datasets. To reduce the overlapping and edge crossings among curves, axes are arranged as concentric circles rather than parallel lines that are commonly used in the traditional approach. Edges which represent data items are drawn as segments of curves rather than poly-lines drawn in the classical parallel coordinate approach. Some heuristics are applied in our new method in order to improve the readability of views. The paper demonstrates the advantages of new method. In comparison with the parallel coordinate method, our concentric circle approach can reduce more than 15 % of the edge overlaps and crossings by visualizing the same dataset. In our new approach, we further enhance the readability of views by increasing the crossing angle. Finally, a visual interactive network scans detection system called CCScanViewer is developed based on our new visualization method to represent traffic activities in network flows, and the experiments show that the new approach is effective in detecting unusual patterns of network scans, port scans, the hidden scans, DDoS attacks etc.

AB  - The present investigation continues previous behavioral profiling studies of selectively bred alcohol-drinking and alcohol non-drinking rats. In this study, alcohol-naive adult Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and non-preferring (sNP) rats were tested in the multivariate concentric square field (TM) (MCSF) test. The MCSF test has an ethoexperimental approach and measures general activity, exploration, risk assessment, risk taking, and shelter seeking in laboratory rodents. The multivariate design enables behavioral profiling in one and the same test situation. Age-matched male Wistar rats were included as a control group. Five weeks after the first MCSF trial, a repeated testing was done to explore differences in acquired experience. The results revealed distinct differences in exploratory strategies and behavioral profiles between sP and sNP rats. The sP rats were characterized by lower activity, lower exploratory drive, higher risk assessment, and lower risk taking behavior than in sNP rats. In the repeated trial, risk-taking behavior was almost abolished in sP rats. When comparing the performance of sP and sNP rats with that of Wistar rats, the principal component analysis revealed that the sP rats were the most divergent group. The vigilant behavior observed in sP rats with low exploratory drive and low risk-taking behavior is interpreted here as high innate anxiety-related behaviors and may be related to their propensity for high voluntary alcohol intake and preference. We suggest that the different lines of alcohol-preferring rats with different behavioral characteristics constitute valuable animal models that mimic the heterogeneity in human alcohol dependence.

AB  - Development and diversification of directional-drilling tools continues, as do the applications in which they operate. As a result, there is continual demand for development and refinement of drill bits and string tools to meet the latest challenges and issues faced. One such challenge is the ability to reliably deliver consistent directional performance in very soft formation applications. Issues such as hole washout, inappropriate drilling parameters, stabilization, and hole quality can all contribute to poor directional-drilling performance.
   Several commercial projects are reviewed where technical merit has justified use of rotary steerable systems (RSSs), but because of the very soft lithologies, these systems have been unable to deliver the required directional control. In each example, a separate engineered solution is introduced. These include
   An innovative concentric string reamer (CSR), featuring a mid reamer section that enables effective stabilization of the reamer even if the pilot borehole is of poor quality or is over gauge.
   A soft formation fixed-cutter drill-bit design with an engineered hydraulic configuration to avoid hole washout and extended circumferential gauge geometry.
   A near-bit stabilizer incorporating a full ring gauge that delivers 360 degrees circumferential coverage, thus providing greater contact with the wellbore and higher potential for deviation.
   A specific bicenter design that uses a secondary component configuration on the face of the pilot to enable appropriate drilling parameters to be used for efficient directional control. The gauge geometry and profile is also tailored to Suit soft formation drilling.
   Global case studies document where these solutions, in combination with both push and point RSSs, have proven extremely successful. These have provided greater flexibility with regard to tool selection, well planning options, and delivering lower cost per foot in rotary-steerable projects.

AB  - According to the most modem trend, performance-based seismic design is aimed at the evaluation of the seismic performance of structures in terms of mean annual frequency of exceeding a threshold level of damage, i.e. a limit state. A procedure for performance-based seismic assessment is herein briefly summarised and applied to concentrically "V" braced steel frames, designed according to different criteria. In particular, two design approaches are examined. The first one corresponds to the provisions suggested by Eurocode 8, while the second approach, proposed by the authors, is based on a rigorous application of the capacity design criteria aiming at the control of the failure mode. In addition in this work a new conception of bracing members is developed and applied with reference to V-braced frames designed according to the methodology proposed by the authors.
   It is well known that aiming at the safeguard of brace connections, Eurocode 8 provides a limitation to the brace slenderness. The drawback of this limitation is the oversizing of brace diagonals at the upper storeys, which prevents the development of a collapse mechanism of global type. This is the starting design issue for the conception of new bracing members. In fact, by introducing in the brace members a zone characterized by a reduction of the cross sectional area (Reduced Section Solution), it is possible to calibrate the yield strength leaving substantially unchanged the slenderness, so that the limits provided for the normalized slenderness can be still satisfied without brace oversizing.
   The aim of this work is to focus on the seismic performance of V-braced frames designed according to both Eurocode provisions and the proposed methodology. For the structures dimensioned according to the proposed criteria, the Reduction Section Solution is also applied with the aim to safeguard the connection without increasing the structural weight. Finally, a probabilistic approach based on the combination of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) and probabilistic seismic capacity analysis (PSCA) is applied aiming to investigate the seismic performance of the designed structures.
   It is pointed out how the proposed design method leads to a very important improvement of the seismic performances with a negligible increase of the overall building cost.

AB  - In the world, bone tuberculosis is still very difficult to treat and presents a challenge to clinicians. In this study, we utilized 3D printing technology to fabricate a programmed release multi-drug implant for bone tuberculosis therapy. The construction of the drug implant was a multi-layered concentric cylinder divided into four layers from the center to the periphery. Isoniazid and rifampicin were distributed individually into the different layers in a specific sequence of isoniazid-rifampicin-isoniazid-rifampicin. The drug release assays in vitro and in vivo showed that isoniazid and rifampicin were released orderly from the outside to the center to form the multi-drug therapeutic alliance, and the peak concentrations of drugs were detected in sequence at 8 to 12 day intervals. In addition, no negative effect on the proliferation of rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was detected during the cytocompatibility assay. Due to its ideal pharmacologic action and cytocompatibility, the programmed release multi-drug implant with a complex construction fabricated by 3D printing technology could be of interest in prevention and treatment of bone tuberculosis.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns can be changed by the application of a temperature shock or pharmacological agents such as tungstate, producing a distinctive type of elemental modification called the TS (temperature shock) type. Heterochronic uncoupling between the signaling and reception steps during the color-pattern determination process has been proposed as a mechanism for TS-type changes. As an extension of this hypothesis, both the parafocal element (PFE) and the eyespot in the same wing compartment are considered to be determined by morphogenic signal(s) emitted from the same eyespot focus. However, these models need to be examined with additional experimental data. Furthermore, there is controversy as to whether the action of tungstate on wing color patterns is direct or indirect. Using a species of nymphalid butterfly (Junonia orithya), we have devised a simple method for the local application of pharmacological agents directly on developing wings of pupae. Local tungstate application resulted in reduced eyespots and circular dislocated PFEs in the eyespot-less compartments only on the treated wing, demonstrating that tungstate directly induces color-pattern changes on wings. We further examined the eyespot-PFE relationship in normal and cold-shocked individuals, showing that an eyespot can be superimposed on a PFE and vice versa, probably depending on the timing of their fate determination. Taken together, we propose a two-morphogen model for the normal color-pattern determination, in which the morphogenic signals for the eyespot and PFE are different from each other despite their identical origin. This two-morphogen model is compatible with the heterochronic uncoupling model for TS-type changes.

AB  - We describe a method to establish chronologies of ancient ribosomal evolution. The method uses structure-based and sequence-based comparison of the large subunits (LSUs) of Haloarcula marismortui and Thermus thermophilus. These are the highest resolution ribosome structures available and represent disparate regions of the evolutionary tree. We have sectioned the superimposed LSUs into concentric shells, like an onion, using the site of peptidyl transfer as the origin (the PT-origin). This spherical approximation combined with a shell-by-shell comparison captures significant information along the evolutionary time line revealing, for example, that sequence and conformational similarity of the 23S rRNAs are greatest near the PT-origin and diverge smoothly with distance from it. The results suggest that the conformation and interactions of both RNA and protein can be described as changing, in an observable manner, over evolutionary time. The tendency of macromolecules to assume regular secondary Structural elements such as A-form helices with Watson-Crick base pairs (RNA) and alpha-helices and beta-sheets (protein) is low at early time points but increases as time progresses. The conformations of ribosomal protein components near the PT-origin suggest that they may be molecular fossils of the peptide ancestors of ribosomal proteins. Their abbreviated length may have proscribed formation of secondary structure, which is indeed nearly absent from the region of the LSU nearest the PT-origin. Formation and evolution of the early PT center may have involved Mg2+-mediated assembly of atleast partially single-stranded RNA oligomers or polymers. As one moves from center to periphery, proteins appear to replace magnesium ions. The LSU is known to have undergone large-scale conformation changes upon assembly. The T. thermophilus LSU analyzed here is part of a fully assembled ribosome, whereas the H. marismortui LSU analyzed here is dissociated from other ribosomal components. Large-scale conformational differences in the 23S rRNAs are evident from superimposition and prevent structural alignment of some portions of the rRNAs, including the L1 stalk.

AB  - Most cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) can produce the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). Dietary exposure to BMAA has been suggested to be involved in the etiology of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC). Little is known about BMAA-induced neurotoxicity following neonatal administration. Our previous studies have revealed an uptake of BMAA in the hippocampus and striatum of neonatal mice. Furthermore, rats treated with BMAA during the neonatal period displayed acute but transient motoric disturbances and failed to show habituation at juvenile age suggesting impairments in learning functions. In the present study, the aim was to investigate long-term behavioral effects of BMAA administration in neonatal rats. BMAA was administered on postnatal days 9-10 (200 or 600 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection). Spatial learning and memory was investigated in adulthood using the radial arm maze test. The results revealed impaired learning but not memory in BMAA-treated animals. The observed impairments were not due to alterations in motoric capacity, general activity, or behavioral profiles, as assessed in the multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) and open field tests. An aversive stimulus in the MCSF test revealed impairments in avoidance learning and/or memory. There was no difference in basal serum corticosterone levels in BMAA-treated animals, indicating that the observed long-term effects were not secondary to an altered basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The present data demonstrated long-term learning impairments following neonatal BMAA administration. Further studies on biochemical effects in various brain regions and subsequent behavioral alterations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of BMAA-induced developmental neurotoxicity.

AB  - LEE, M. J. C. S. L. REID, B. C. ELLIOTT, and D. G. LLOYD. Running Biomechanics and Lower Limb Strength Associated with Prior Hamstring Injury, Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 10, pp. 1942-1951, 2009. Purpose: Hamstrings injury/reinjury is common, but functional reasons for this remain unclear. This Study identified bilateral differences in swing phase running biomechanics and isokinetic strength, between the previously hamstring-injured and Uninjured limbs, of male athletes involved in sprint-based sports. Methods: Athletes, injury-free during testing, underwent three-dimensional motion analyses to determine bilateral joint kinematics and kinetics during submaximal sprinting. Various hip and knee isokinetic strength tests were performed bilaterally using a Biodex dynamometer. Peak torque (PT) and total work (TW; normalized to body mass) were collected isokinetically from concentric hamstrings (CH), concentric quadriceps (CQ), concentric hip flexors (CHF), and eccentric hamstrings (EH). Three PT and TW ratios were created, namely, CH/CQ, EH/CQ, and EH/CHF. and were compared between the previously injured and uninjured limbs. Results: Lower limb swing phase kinematics and kinetics were similar. Only peak hip flexion angle in late swing was significantly reduced (1.9 degrees) in the previously injured limb. EH PT was decreased (26.2 N.m.kg(-1)) and occurred at shorter hamstring lengths on the previously injured side, whereas CQ TW was increased by 13.6 J.kg(-1). EH/CQ and EH/CHF ratios for PT and TW were reduced on the previously injured limbs. Conclusions: Although swing phase biomechanics of submaximal sprinting were similar between limbs, the previously injured hamstrings did display significant weakness eccentrically. Residual eccentric weakness may predispose this muscle group to reinjury during late swing, compared with the Uninjured limb, because the functional eccentric demand on both limbs was similar. Furthermore, the EH/CHF ratios may better reflect muscle function during sprinting, having the potential to influence rehabilitation to prevent reinjury.

AB  - This Study aimed to establish the effect of age and pubertal development on relative peak torque in youth footballers. One hundred and fifty-seven subjects were arranged into U12-U18 age groups; of these 133 also completed a self-reporting measure of pubertal development (PDS) and were grouped accordingly. Bilateral isokinetic testing included mean peak torque/body weight (PT/BW) and angle of peak torque (AoPT) for reps 2-4 of 5 in concentric quadriceps (Q), concentric hamstrings (CH) and eccentric hamstrings (EH) at 60 degrees s(-1). Two minutes rest were provided between concentric and eccentric tests for both legs. A significant increase with age was noted for PT/BW in CO, CH and EH (P<0.05), although post hoc analyses revealed different patterns of significance dependent upon muscle and type of contraction. Specifically, the U18s (CQ:2.20 nm/kg, CH:1.39 nm/kg, EH:2.16 nm/kg) were not significantly stronger than the U16s and U15s (CQ:2.42/2.29 nm/kg, CH:1.41/1.27 nm/kg, EH:2.22/2.115 nm/kg) even though they had entered full time training. The relationship between EH PT/BW and AoPT showed a weak but significant inverse correlation (P<0.001; R = -0.390 and -0.346 for dominant and non dominant legs). The findings of this study present unique football specific normative and age/PDS group data for PT/BW and AoPT, and the corresponding relationship between these variables.

AB  - This study aimed to analyse the effect of age on muscle peak torque (PT), and Hamstring (H): Quadricep (Q) ratio in elite youth footballers. To date, no Study has considered age-group playing level and pubertal development in this population. One hundred and fifty-seven elite youth footballers in the age groups U12 to U18 volunteered to participate in this study, 133 of these were further grouped for pubertal development. Prior to testing subjects completed separate familiarisation, a three minute cycle ergometer warm up (resistance 50-60W), and two sub-maximal repetitions. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic PT measures for reps 2-4 of H and Q muscle action were taken at 60 degrees s(-1). From this, conventional and functional H:Q ratio was calculated along with dominant: non dominant ratio for the concentric Q and H, and eccentric H conditions. Significant main effects were observed for the age/pubertal development group and PT in all muscles and conditions (P<0.05). Of particular interest was a significant main effect for age and Functional H:Q (P<0.05), which suggested a move away from equality at U18. Our study provides normative data for coaches, trainers and clinicians working with youth footballers and may also have connotations for injury prevention and performance.

AB  - Background: Hamstring injuries are common in sprinters. Identifying preseason risk factors is essential to target injury-prone athletes and develop injury preventive measures.
   Objective: To investigate the incidence of hamstring muscle injury in sprinters over an athletic season and to explore the preseason predictor of this injury.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Participants: 44 sprinters from the Hong Kong Sports Institute, the Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association and intercollegiate athletic teams were recruited.
   Methods: Preseason assessment of hamstring flexibility, concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque and peak torque angle were obtained at the beginning of an athletic season. The athletes were followed over 12 months and were asked to report all injuries resulting from training and competition.
   Results: Eight athletes sustained hamstring injuries over the season. The injury rate was 0.87 per 1000 h of exposure. The incidence of injuries was higher at the beginning of the season, with 58.3% injuries occurring in the first 100 h of exposure. Cox regression analysis revealed that athletes with a decrease in the hamstring : quadriceps peak torque ratio of less than 0.60 at an angular velocity of 180 degrees/s have a 17-fold increased risk of hamstring injury.
   Conclusion: Performing preseason hamstring : quadriceps peak torque ratio assessments may be useful to identify sprinters susceptible to hamstring injury.

AB  - In April 2007, Piton de la Fournaise volcano experienced a caldera collapse during its largest historical eruption. We present here a structural analysis both of the caldera and the surrounding area, and precise GPS data recorded with a dense GPS network specifically dedicated to the analysis of deformation related to the summit collapse structures. Despite a collapse of more than 300 m in the central zone, the geometry of the new caldera is similar in map view to that of the pre-existing collapsed structure, which was formed from the coalescence of several pit craters. The caldera shows an asymmetric inner geometry with sub-vertical walls in the NW quadrant and steep scarps composed of inward tilted blocks in the southern half The presence of preserved polished surfaces on the lower part of the sub-vertical scarp indicates that it corresponds to the caldera north-western ring fault. The April 2007 caldera collapse led to the development and the reactivation of concentric fractures on the caldera rim, mostly along the southern limit of the caldera. GPS data show that fractures result from radial extensional stresses that are restricted within the first tens of meters of the caldera edge. GPS data also reveal that the caldera collapse was coeval with a centripetal deflation, whose magnitude is largest along the southern half of the caldera. The displacements recorded by GPS result from both a general deflation, due to magma withdrawal from Piton de la Fournaise's summit magma chamber, and additional local effects related to the caldera collapse. Comparison of the caldera collapses at Piton de la Fournaise. Miyakejima and Fernandina reveals striking similarities, with cyclic seismic signals accompanying small-scale deflation-inflation cycles. This strongly suggests a common mode of collapse. Hence, we propose a unifying model of caldera collapse in basaltic setting, in which the inward deflation due to magma withdrawal from the magma chamber prevents the collapse of the caldera roof until the gravitational stress acting on the rock column above the magma chamber exceeds the shear strength along pre-existing ring faults. The downward displacement stops when the pressure increase into the magma chamber is able to again sustain the rock column. The succession of (1) inward deflation that prevents the collapse, (2) collapse due to gravitational stress and (3) stopping of the downward motion is repeated many times. The frequency of the cycles is influenced by the rate of magma withdrawal and by the amount of intrusion of magma along the ring faults. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs) migrate along the intestine to form a highly organized network of ganglia that comprises the enteric nervous system (ENS). The signals driving the migration and patterning of these cells are largely unknown. Examining the spatiotemporal development of the intestinal neurovasculature in avian embryos, we find endothelial cells (ECs) present in the gut prior to the arrival of migrating ENCCs. These ECs are patterned in concentric rings that are predictive of the positioning of later arriving crest-derived cells, leading us to hypothesize that blood vessels may serve as a substrate to guide ENCC migration. Immunohistochemistry at multiple stages during ENS development reveals that ENCCs are positioned adjacent to vessels as they colonize the gut. A similar close anatomic relationship between vessels and enteric neurons was observed in zebrafish larvae. When EC development is inhibited in Cultured avian intestine, ENCC migration is arrested and distal aganglionosis results, suggesting that ENCCs require the presence of vessels to colonize the gut. Neural tube and avian midgut were explanted onto a variety of substrates, including components of the extracellular matrix and various cell types, such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. We find that crest-derived cells from both the neural tube and the midgut migrate avidly onto Cultured endothelial cells. This EC-induced migration is inhibited by the presence of CSAT antibody, which blocks binding to beta 1 integrins expressed on the surface of crest-derived cells. These results demonstrate that ECs provide a Substrate for the migration of ENCCs via an interaction between beta 1 integrins on the ENCC surface and extracellular matrix proteins expressed by the intestinal vasculature. These interactions may play an important role in guiding migration and patterning in the developing ENS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Historically, morphological variation has been used to classify many species (and subspecies) of Lepidoptera. However, some of this variation may be unsuitable for inferring the recent evolutionary history of populations. Genetic data provide an alternative. We examine the morphological and genetic variation within and between British subspecies of Coenonympha tullia (Muller 1764) to test the hypothesis that neutral genetic variation corresponds to morphological variation. We find that most morphological and genetic variation occurs within populations and that those populations designated as subspecies based on morphological characters are not necessarily most closely related for mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA (amplified fragment length polymorphisms and allozymes). Thus, the notion that wing spot variation reflects population isolation and therefore genetic differentiation does not hold. The present study highlights the need for genetic data where taxonomy may be based on environmentally plastic or locally adapted characters because such characters will not reflect the true population genetic history.

AB  - We have measured high-precision Hf, Nd, and Pb isotope compositions for 40 samples from the final leg of the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP) core using solution chemistry and MC-ICP-MS. The new isotope data are indistinguishable from those higher up in the Mauna Kea part of the core. The Pb isotope data define three linear trends with a common intersection. Principal component analysis recognizes no more than three geochemical end-members among these trends. When all the Pb isotope data acquired so far for the HSDP core are pooled, two contrasting groups stand out. A first coherent, prevalent group represents the Kea main eruptive sequence. This group combines the Kea-mid8 and Kea-lo8 subgroups of Eisele et al. (Eisele, I., Abouchami, W., Galer, S.J.G., Hofmann, A.W., 2003. The 320 kyr Pb isotope evolution of Mauna Kea lavas recorded in the HSDP-2 drill core. Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 4, doi: 10.1029/2002GC000339): although defining two separate trends in Pb-Pb isotope space, they follow each other smoothly in time. A second group of 14 flows below 2000 mbsl is characterized by distinctly higher source Th/U and high He-3/He-4. These samples belong to the Kea-hi8 group and are about 0.4 (Hf) and 0.5 (Nd) C units below the main sequence Kea values. The toggle between these two groups is so sharp and repetitive and the gap between the values so conspicuous that the alternation must reflect eruptions from distinct volcanic centers, those of Mauna Kea and an unknown volcano, the latter of which bears isotopic resemblance to Kilauea for Nd and Hf and to Loihi for He. This 'lost' volcano stopped erupting about 550 ka ago, i.e., 200 ka before the oldest known ages for Kilauea, and is presently buried under 2000-3000 m of Kea flows. Periodograms show no wavelengths exceeding the 95% significance level (white spectrum). Except for a few minor wiggles in Hf at shallow depth, the isotopic signals display overall smooth up-core variations with little short-distance variability. Analysis of the flow regime within the plume conduit shows that temperature dependence of viscosity makes the conduit narrow and sharply bound. The hot core is highly mobile with minimum shear rates and a regime of pipe (Poiseuille) flow. The core is rimmed by a sheath of colder, strongly stretched material (filaments). A broadly concentric zoning of the plume is expected. The white spectra suggest, however, that, at any given depth within the plume conduit, lateral mixing results from the theological variability across the plume conduit. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experiments in humans have shown that changes in emotional (affective) state Cause adaptive changes in the processing of incoming information, termed "cognitive bias". For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with "pessimistic" judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling "threat call" (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds' behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety.

AB  - The purpose of this note is to introduce an experimental technique to overcome ductile failure in uniaxial extensional flow and show a simple illustration of its effectiveness. Ductile failure prevents the rheological measurement of transient stress growth at higher strains for certain strain-hardening materials. This reduces the accuracy of nonlinear parameters for constitutive equations fit from transient stress growth data, as well as their effectiveness in modeling extensionally driven processes such as film casting. We propose an experimental technique to overcome ductile failure called encapsulation in which the material that undergoes ductile failure is surrounded by a resin that readily deforms homogeneously at higher strains. The materials are arranged in concentric cylinders and are deformed in parallel. A simple parallel model is shown to calculate the viscosity of the core material and is tested for its robustness in a linear low-density polyethylene/low-density polyethylene system in which the viscosities of each resin are known at all strains, strain rates, and temperatures investigated. Agreement is found at each strain rate investigated across all strains studied. The method is then extended to measure the viscosity of a sparsely branched high-density polyethylene (HDPE) system that undergoes ductile failure at higher strain rates. The technique shows good agreement with experimental results up to the onset of ductile failure in the pure resin and predicts viscosity growth of the HDPE resin well beyond the critical strain for the onset of failure seen in experimental measurements of the pure HDPE. Repeatability of the technique is also illustrated. (C) 2009 The Society of Rheology. [DOI: 10.1122/1.3109574]

AB  - Dislocations and fracture-dislocations of the elbow joint result in typical injury patterns of variable joint instability. A systematic and early in-depth analysis of the injury components offers the approach to the options of therapy and the evaluation of the risk potential of the individual lesion. Standardized diagnostic algorithms help to avoid an inadequate assessment of the extent of injury. With regard to the choice of therapy finding a balance between the concentric reduction of the elbow joint, stability and an early regain of motion provides the key to a good functional outcome. A great number of simple elbow dislocations have a good prognosis and can be managed with early motion due to the inherent joint stability after closed reduction. In contrast, the more rare osteo-ligamentous combination injuries have a poor prognosis if the corresponding injury components are not adequately recognized and addressed by a mostly technically demanding surgical treatment to avoid the otherwise impending typical complications. A standardized surgical algorithm may provide the basis to achieve a satisfactory functional result in this challenging clinical entity of elbow trauma.

AB  - Butterfly wing characteristics are extensively used as model system in studies of development, quantitative genetics and phenotypic plasticity. In spite of its evolutionary relevance, however, the effect of stress on the expression of genetic variation itself has only rarely been studied. In this paper, we explore genetic variation of wing characteristics of the Speckled wood Pararge aegeria along a host plant drought stress gradient. Forewing area, basal and distal degree of melanization and the area of five yellow wing spots were measured. We found an increase in (additive) genetic variation in degree of melanization at higher drought stress, and a similar, yet non-significant, relationship for forewing size. As a result, both the upper limits of the narrow-sense heritability and the coefficient of additive genetic variation of wing size and melanization increased with drought stress. Patterns for the different yellow wing spots were less consistent, suggesting trait-specificity in the relationships between genetic variation and environmental stress.

AB  - In this work a novel type of high temperature solar collector is designed: the rotating solar boiler. This rotating solar boiler consists of two concentric tubes. The inner tube, called absorber, absorbs sunlight and boils water. The outer transparent tube, called cover, is filled with air. The boiler rotates to completely prevent convection in the insulating air layer in between the tubes. In this way, the heat loss is reduced considerably resulting in a solar collector that is more efficient than conventional flat plate solar collectors. The prototype built measured 1.20 m length and 0.50 m diameter (illuminated area is 0.60 m(2)) for the copper absorber with high performance sputtered coating. The cover with a diameter of 0.90 m was made of transparent polyvinylchloride film. The rotation speed was 60 rpm. The efficiency was 61% and the boiler delivered 0.34 kW of 100 degrees C steam at an ambient temperature of 7 degrees C. A model was developed to predict the performance of the prototype. The model predicts an efficiency of 62%, which is in agreement with the measured experimental efficiency. An economical analysis was performed as well. The rotating solar boiler is much cheaper than conventional evacuated tube collectors, especially because the rotating solar boiler is lightweight.

AB  - The prescription of eccentric loading is considered as a mainstay of non-operative rehabilitation programmes for mid-substance chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Such exercises have some degree of clinical utility in comparison with concentric training and are often referred to as a strengthening programme. Yet the dose parameters of the eccentric loading do not reflect an optimal strengthening programme and specifically avoid the normal eccentric-concentric coupling typical of the stretch shortening cycle. This manuscript identifies the arguments and counterarguments for why eccentric loading rehabilitation is not an optimal strengthening programme. It is proposed that such exercises reflect a specific stretching programme directed at the passive structures. This has two important clinical implications. Firstly, this reinterpretation of the role of eccentric exercises may direct future research into the underlying mechanisms of tendinopathy and, secondly, it may reinforce the importance of adjunct sports specific strengthening programmes.

AB  - We studied two courtship displays of male peafowl (Pavo cristatus), focusing particularly on male orientation relative to the position of the sun. During the "wing-shaking" display, females were generally behind the displaying male, and male orientation with respect to the position of the sun was not significantly different from random. However, during the pre-copulatory "train-rattling" display, males were on average directed at about 45A degrees to the right of the sun azimuth with the female positioned directly in front, suggesting that this behaviour is involved in the communication of a visual signal. A model presentation experiment confirmed that courting peacocks were more likely to perform the train-rattling display when the female was on the sunny side of their erect train, but more likely to perform wing-shaking behaviour when the female was on the shaded side of the male. This study underscores the importance of visual signalling in peafowl courtship, and we suggest that an angle of about 45A degrees relative to the sun may allow males to enhance the appearance of their iridescent eyespot feathers.

AB  - Bacterial spores possess a series of concentrically arranged protective structures that contribute to dormancy, survival and, ultimately, germination. One of these structures, the coat, is present in all spores. In Bacillus anthracis, however, the spore is surrounded by an additional, poorly understood, morphologically complex structure called the exosporium. Here, we characterize three previously discovered exosporium proteins called ExsFA (also known as BxpB), ExsFB (a highly related paralogue of exsFA/bxpB) and lunH (similar to an inosine-uridine-pref erring nucleoside hydrolase). We show that in the absence of ExsFA/BxpB, the exosporium protein BclA accumulates asymmetrically to the forespore pole closest to the midpoint of the sporangium (i.e. the mother-cell-proximal pole of the forespore), instead of uniformly encircling the exosporium. ExsFA/BxpB may also have a role in coat assembly, as mutant spore surfaces lack ridges seen in wild-type spores and have a bumpy appearance. ExsFA/BxpB also has a modest but readily detected effect on germination. Nonetheless, an exsFA/bxpB mutant strain is fully virulent in both intramuscular and aerosol challenge models in Guinea pigs. We show that the pattern of localization of ExsFA/BxpB-GFP is a ring, consistent with a location for this protein in the basal layer of the exosporium. In contrast, ExsFB-GFP fluorescence is a solid oval, suggesting a distinct subcellular location for ExsFB-GFP. We also used these fusion proteins to monitor changes in the subcellular locations of these proteins during sporulation. Early in sporulation, both fusions were present throughout the mother cell cytoplasm. As sporulation progressed, GFP fluorescence moved from the mother cell cytoplasm to the forespore surface and formed either a ring of fluorescence, in the case of ExsFA/BxpB, or a solid oval of fluorescence, in the case of ExsFB. lunH-GFP also resulted in a solid oval of fluorescence. We suggest the interpretation that at least some ExsFB-GFP and lunH-GFP resides in the region between the coat and the exosporium, called the interspace.

AB  - Using a convective plume model and a ray trace model, we investigate the effects of winds on concentric rings of gravity waves (GWs) excited from a convective plume on 11 May 2004, near Fort Collins, Colorado. We find that winds can shift the apparent center of the concentric rings at z = 87 km from the plume location. We also find that critical level filtering (for GWs with small phase speeds propagating in the same direction as the wind) and wave reflection (for high-frequency GWs with small horizontal wavelengths propagating in the opposite direction to the wind) prevent many GWs from reaching the OH airglow layer. Additionally, we find that strong winds disrupt the concentric ring patterns, causing distorted "squashed'' ring and arc-like patterns instead. Using a zero wind profile and a representative April mean zonal wind profile, we compare our model results with observations of concentric rings at the Yucca Ridge Field Station (40.7 degrees N, 104.9 degrees W). We find that the model horizontal wavelengths and periods agree reasonably well with the observed data. We also compare the model temperature perturbations with the temperature perturbations calculated from the intensity perturbations. Because the observations show less critical level filtering than from the April wind profile and more critical level filtering than from the zero wind profile, we conclude that the winds on 11 May were likely somewhat smaller than the April zonal wind profile assumed here.

AB  - The incidence and heat resistance of conidiospores produced by dermatophytes isolated from athlete's kits (canvasses, stockings and spike shoes) stored in Nigerian University Sport's Centre were investigated. Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum oudouinii, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton concentricum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum were isolated and their incidence on the athlete's kits varied with the species and type of kits. Among the isolates T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum and E. floccosum with 25%, 23% and 20% prevalence rates respectively, were the most common isolates, and are often associated with tinea pedis (athletes foot). Canvasses with the highest incidence of dermatophytes (25 out of 34 fungal isolates) were the most contaminated kits and could serve as effective articles for the transmission of tinea pedis among athletes in Nigeria. The common etiological agents screened, produced asexual spores (conidiospores) that exhibited high resistance to heat treatment at 80 degrees C. Of the three isolates, E. floccosum, with a decimal reduction time (D-value) of D-80 = 4.4 min was the most resistant followed by T. mentagrophytes with D-80 = 4.0 min and then T. rubrum with D-80 = 3.2 min. The spores elimination pattern indicates that increasing the heating duration would decrease the decimal reduction time and possibly denature the fungal propagules but may damage the skin during treatment with hot water compresses. The findings have shown that the use of hot water compresses is palliative but heat treatment especially vapour-heat treatment offers adequate preventive measures if applied for periodic treatment of contaminated kits. However, determining the correct condition for effective decontamination will require detailed understanding of the heat resistance of fungal spores. Otherwise treatment of kits with detergent and chaotropic agent such as urea and guanidinium salt is preferred to heat treatment.

AB  - Photomotility responses in flagellate alga are mediated by two types of sensory rhodopsins (A and B). Upon photoexcitation they trigger a cascade of transmembrane currents which provide sensory transduction of light stimuli. Both types of algal sensory rhodopsins demonstrate light-gated ion channel activities when heterologously expressed in animal cells, and therefore they have been given the alternative names channelrhodopsin 1 and 2. In recent publications their channel activity has been assumed to initiate the transduction chain in the native algal cells. Here we present data showing that: (1) the modes of action of both types of sensory rhodopsins are different in native cells such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii than in heterologous expression systems, and also differ between the two types of rhodopsins; (2) the primary function of Type B sensory rhodopsin (channelrhodopsin-2) is biochemical activation of secondary Ca2+-channels with evidence for amplification and a diffusible messenger, sufficient for mediating phototaxis and photophobic responses; (3) Type A sensory rhodopsin (channelrhodopsin-1) mediates avoidance responses by direct channel activity under high light intensities and exhibits low-efficiency amplification. These dual functions of algal sensory rhodopsins enable the highly sophisticated photobehavior of algal cells.

AB  - A simple and commercial readily-available approach that enables the direct use of ionic liquid (IL)-based single-drop microextraction (SDME) prior to gas chromatography (GC) is presented. The approach is based on thermal desorption (TD) of the analytes from the IL droplet to the GC system, by using a robust and commercially-available thermodesorption system. For this purpose, a two-glass-tube concentrically disposed system was designed. The inner tube is a laboratory-cut Pyrex tube (20 mm length) that houses the ionic liquid droplet from the SDME process, and the outer tube is a commercially-available TD glass tube (187 mm length) commonly employed for stir-bar sorptive extractions (SBSE). In this way, the proposed device prevents IL from entering the GC system, as this could dirty the inlet or even block the column. The determination of 10 chlorobenzenes in water samples by GC coupled with mass spectrometric(MS) detection has been chosen as model analytical application, showing the feasibility of the proposed approach. The SDME process consists of a 5 p,L droplet of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C6MIM][PF6]) suspended in the headspace (HS) of a 10mL stirred sample. After extracting for 37 min at room temperature, the IL droplet is directly placed into the small inner tube, which is placed into the TD tube. The whole device is placed inside the TD unit, where desorption of the analytes is performed at 240 degrees C for 5 min with a helium flow rate of 100 mL min(-1). The analytical figures of merit of the proposed IL-(HS)-SDME-TD-GC-MS approach are very suitable for the determination of chlorobenzenes at ultratrace levels, with relative standard deviation values ranging between 2% and 17%, and limits of detection ranging between 1 and 4 ng L-1, showing the potential offered by the IL-based SDME process with GC.

AB  - Healing wounds are commonly examined by pathologists at the time of reexcision of skin tumors to ensure complete removal of the lesion. In addition to searching for residual turner, possible perineural invasion must be assessed. During routine examination of reexcision specimens, 10 cases of prominent perineural proliferation were seen associated with fine nerves in the mid or deep dermis. The process showed a concentric cellular proliferation with no, or only limited, nuclear hyperchromasia or pleomorphism. In a number of cases, immunohistochemistry was essential to exclude the possibility of malignant perineural invasion or other mimics of this process such as reexcision perineural invasion. The term reparative perineural hyperplasia is proposed for this entity, which is important for pathologists to be aware of to avoid misdiagnosis.

AB  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are a phenotypically coordinated array of scales whose color is determined as cellular interpretation outputs for morphogenic signals. Here we investigated distribution patterns of scale shape and size in relation to position and coloration on the hindwings of a nymphalid butterfly Junonia orithya. Most scales had a smooth edge but scales at and near the natural and ectopic eyespot foci and in the postbasal area were jagged. Scale size decreased regularly from the postbasal to distal areas, and eyespots; occasionally had larger scales than the background. Reasonable correlations were obtained between the eyespot size and focal scale size in females. Histological and real-time individual observations of the color-pattern developmental sequence showed that the background brown and blue colors expanded from the postbasal to distal areas independently from the color-pattern elements such as eyespots. These data suggest that morphogenic signals for coloration directly or indirectly influence the scale shape and size and that the blue "background" is organized by a long-range signal from an unidentified organizing center in J. orithya.

AB  - A favorite wing pattern element in butterflies that has been the focus of intense study in evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as in behavioral ecology, is the eyespot. Because the pace of research on these bull's eye patterns is accelerating we sought to develop a tool to automatically detect and measure butterfly eyespot patterns in digital images of the wings. We used a machine learning algorithm with features based on circularity and symmetry to detect eyespots on the images. The algorithm is first trained with examples from a database of images with two different labels (eyespot and non-eyespot), and subsequently is able to provide classification for a new image. After an eyespot is detected the radius measurements of its color rings are performed by a 1D Hough Transform which corresponds to histogramming. We trained software to recognize eyespot patterns of the nymphalid butterfly Bicyclus anynana but eyespots of other butterfly species were also successfully detected by the software.

AB  - Breast cancer is a very common disease and the cause of death of many people. It has been proven that prevention decreases the death rate, but the costs of diagnosis and image processing are very high when applied to all the population with potential risk. This paper studies an existent computer aided diagnosis method using neural network and improves its detection success rate from 60% to 73%. This improvement is achieved due to the use of image and statistical operators over concentric regions around the tumor boundaries.

AB  - Study aim: To determine muscle strength variables in elite judoists and wrestlers since thigh muscle strength and bilaterally balanced flexor-to-extensor ratio minimise injury risk and are desirable for achieving sport successes.
   Material and methods: Judoists, wrestlers and untrained subjects, 10 each, were subjected to isokinetic strength measurements of relative peak torques of knee flexor and extensor muscles on "Easy-Tech" dynamometer in concentric- concentric mode.
   Results: Mean relative peak muscle torques for knee flexors ranged from 1.14 +/- 0.27 (untrained) to 1.57 +/- 0.40 (judoists) N +/- m/kg and for knee extensors from 2.77 +/- 0.34 (untrained) to 3.60 +/- 0.64 (wrestlers) N +/- m/kg. The flexorto- extensor ratios ranged from 39.3 +/- 6.0 to 47.8 +/- 10.8% and did not differ significantly between groups. Absolute right/left asymmetry for knee flexors ranged from 14.6 +/- 10.4 to 17.4 +/- 11.8% and was significantly (p< 0.01) higher than for knee extensors (7.2 +/- 6.8 to 8.6 +/- 7.7%). All asymmetry indices were significant (p< 0.01), no significant between group differences being detected.
   Conclusions: Implementing new training elements and modalities may improve the performance and prevent lateral asymmetry thus decreasing the risk of injuries.

AB  - Background: Warm-up before exercise could increase blood flow of whole body, increase muscles and skin temperature, prevent injury within exercise. Passive warm-up can increase temperature of muscles as active warm-up do, but it won't cause the muscle fatigue. To use heat packs or to apply ultrasound is the way for passive warm-up. Purpose: determine the effects of two different modalities of passive warm-up and exercise without warm-up on exercise performance and recovery on muscle damage. Methods: Eight volunteers were participated in this study (age = 23.88 +/- 5.06 y/o), and all of them were involved into three groups as control group (CON), heat packing group (HP) and ultrasound group (USD). CON never received any warm-up protocol before eccentric exercise, HP received 15 minutes of superficial heat with electrical heat pack before exercise, and USD received 7 minutes of deep heat with ultrasound diathermy before exercise. Each subject processed 30 repeated bouts of eccentric exercise with 80% MVC level. Serum CK, MVC, ROM and CIR were measured before, immediately after exercise and at 2(nd), 4(th), 7(th), and 10(th) days post-exercise. Results: When measuring serum CK and CIR, there were no significant difference between CON, HP and USD (p>0.05). When measuring ROM and MVC, there were significant difference between CON, HP and USD (p<0.05). Conclusion: USD and HP have better muscle strength and performance than CON. According to the recovery procedure, USD took lesser damage on muscles than HP and CON. USD had lesser swelling then HP and CON in recovery stage a er exercise.

AB  - In a parachute, an increase of drag force occurs when the frontal area or the area of its canopy is increased. To prevent the technical problem in deployment of large parachutes, designing parachutes consisting of more than one canopy with smaller frontal area with an air vent at the top of each one is suggested. In this investigation, several formations of canopies are considered, and all are set as concentric and is placed at the top of each other with some distances apart. The canopies are taken as solid bluff bodies (Helm-spherical cups) for simplicity. The effect of two variables on drag is the main idea of this study. All the formations of the two canopies (Two bluff bodies) are based on two variables; the diameter ratio (The diameter of the upper canopy to the lower canopy), and the distance between the canopies. The drag force is found at maximum, when the upper and the lower canopies have equal diameters, and for when the distance between the canopies is twice the upper canopy diameter.

AB  - In this paper, we propose two video fingerprinting methods that are robust to both geometric and non-geometric modifications on content. Both of the proposed methods are based on computation of moment invariants as features from concentric circular regions. The two methods differ in the way they capture appearance and motion information from video. In one method, we capture motion information by computing a difference image between the current video frame and a temporal average video frame computed from a past window of video frames. This method captures appearance by computing moment invariants from concentric circular regions of a video frame. In the second method, we capture appearance and motion by projecting features onto two sets of basis functions and explicitly capture how the moment invariants change over the regions and over time. We present experimental results on both of these video fingerprinting comparing their performance in terms of robustness against attacks and sensitivity to content.

CP  - 6th International Conference on Behaviour of Steel Structures in Seismic Areas
AB  - Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a parametric method that is used to assess the performance of structural systems under different seismic excitations. This method consists of subjecting the structure to a series of scaled ground motion records to successive stepwise incremented intensity levels until collapse is reached. An IDA curve of the structural response is generated by drawing the storey drift values obtained from nonlinear dynamic analyses at the ground motion different intensity levels. The purpose of employing the IDA method in this study is to emphasize the performance-based earthquake design of an 8-storey zipper concentrically braced steel frames located in Victoria, B.C., Canada. In order to process and summarized the information from the IDA curves, the cross-sectional fractile method was employed. It is shown that global dynamic instability occurs simultaneously or shortly after the collapse prevention limit-state is reached.

AB  - Fungicides are routinely used to prevent yield losses in winter wheat in southern Sweden. Yield and 1000 grain weight (TGW) data from 432 trials in farmers' fields were evaluated to review long-term yields (1977-2005) and control of eyespot and Leaf Blotch Diseases (LBDs, including Septoria tritici blotch, Stagonospora nodorum blotch and tan spot), powdery mildew, brown rust and yellow rust. Regression analyses revealed that control of LBDs explained 74% of the yield increase achieved by fungicide treatment at GS 45-61, followed by powdery mildew (20%), brown rust (5%) and yellow rust (1%). Yield of both untreated and fungicide-treated plots increased from approx. 6000 to 12000 kg ha(-1) over the period 1983-2005. Single eyespot treatment improved yield by similar to 320 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the period 1977-2002, mainly due to occasional years with severe eyespot. Single leaf disease treatment at GS 45-61 increased mean yield by 10.3% or 810 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (9.9% or 660 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for 1983-1994 and 10.7% or 970 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for 1995-2005) due to increased TGW and grain numbers, especially in high-yielding stands. Additional extra early treatment at GS 30-40 against LBDs increased yield by similar to 250 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Estimated variance in yield and TGW was higher between years than within years, while that in yield increase and plant diseases was lower between years than within. The results confirm potential and limits of fungicides and the need for supervised control strategies including factors affecting disease, yield and interactions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was twofold: first to assess the effect of fatigue on two muscle strength ratios: the conventional ratio-H-con/Q(con) and dynamic control ratio(DCR)-H-ecc/Q(con) and second to assess the coactivation of hamstrings and quadriceps during isokinetic knee flexion/extension. Eight recreational football players (mean +/- SD age: 22 +/- 2.3 yr; body mass: 85 +/- 3.30 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Peak concentric and eccentric torque of the hamstrings and quadriceps were measured at 120 degrees/s pre and post fatigue using an isokinetic dynamometer. The fatiguing protocol consisted of 50 maximal concentric knee flexion/extension repetitions. Using surface EMG, peak RMS of the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis were measured in order to calculate muscle coactivation during extension and flexion of the knee. Paired samples t-tests concluded that there was a significant increase in both the conventional ratio (0.75 vs. 1.02) and the DCR (0.88 vs. 1.08) following fatigue. A significant increase in hamstring coactivation during concentric quadriceps muscle actions following fatigue was also observed (18.6 vs. 21.3%). These data contribute to the literature aiding the future development of the DCR and its use in injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies.

AB  - Plasma-sprayed Al(2)O(3) interlayer was prefabricated between the bondcoat and topcoat in thermal barrier coatings. It can prevent oxygen penetration through the interconnected porosity in the topcoat, so that the thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth and the failure can be suppressed. But, prefabricated Al(2)O(3) interlayer will result in interfacial stress redistributing. The paper, basing on three-dimensional shape of thermal barrier coatings, using elastic sphere model, considering topcoat, interlayer, TGO and bondcoat, have developed a four-concentric-sphere model of three-dimensional, and produced the relevant analytical model. Furthermore, to verify the results by FEM. In this paper, the analysis of anti-oxidation layer for the concave and convex asperity, indicate that the method can simulate the effect of interlayer on the interfacial microstructure's stress distributing of thermal barrier coatings.

AB  - This paper describes a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) for the synthesis of the low sidelobe concentric ring arrays. The MPSO has been utilized to optimize the element placement in a concentric ring array to obtain the lowest peak sidelobe level (PSLL). And here the multiple optimization constraints include the array aperture, the minimum ring spacing and the element spacing in each ring. Unlike standard PSO using fixed corresponding relationship between the optimal variables and their coding, the MPSO utilized the coding resetting of optimal variables to avoid infeasible solution during the optimization process. Also, the proposed approach has reduced the size of the searching area of the PSO by means of indirect description of individual. The simulated results confirming the great efficiency and robustness of this algorithm are provided in this paper.

AB  - During November 2000, a collection of acanthocephalans from birds in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, included a new genus and species in a new family and order. Pyrirhynchus heterospinus n. gen., n. sp. (Pyrirhynchidae n. fam.: Heteramorphida: new order) is described from Actitis hypoleucos (Linnaeus, 1758) (common sandpiper). The new family combines characters from Polymorphidae and Heteracanthocephalidae, and it includes new features. Specimens of the new species are distinguished from those of Heteracanthocephalidae and/or Polymorphidae by their long cylindrical trunk with anterior swelling, pyriform proboscis with hooks much larger ventrally, brain at the anterior end of the receptacle, specialized tubular cement glands, and elliptoid eggs with concentric shells. A detailed analysis of proboscis and trunk armature is included, and specimens of several species of Arhythmorhynchus Luhe, 1911 (Polymorphidae) were studied for comparative purposes. The proboscis of P. heterospinus is armed with 17 to 20 rows of 17 to 19 hooks each, with anterior 9-11 hooks rooted and posterior 6-10 spines rootless.

AB  - National Forest Inventories (NFI) are a basic tool for forestry planning at the National level. A new two-step system for predicting ingrowth compatible with NFI data is presented in order to improve long-term estimation of stand condition. In growth and yield models, an ingrowth submodel is a key feature for long-term estimation. An accurate projection of ingrowth is needed to avoid model projection bias and inaccuracy. A two-step approach was used, which consisted of (1) estimating the probability of ingrowth occurrence on a sample plot and (II) quantifying the ingrowth in terms of basal area. Logistic regression was used for step I, while linear regression was used for step II. A good performance of the joint ingrowth model for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Mediterranean Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait. Ssp mesogeensis) stands was observed. Logistic model include quadratic mean diameter as independent variables for both species while basal area is only included for Mediterranean Maritime. Quadratic mean diameter is the only independent variable in linear model for both species. The presented two-step modeling methodology for ingrowth is applicable to data from National Forest Inventories with concentric plots.

AB  - Recent efforts to reduce the measurement time for multidimensional NMR experiments have fostered the development of a variety of new procedures for sampling and data processing. We recently described concentric ring sampling for 3-D NMR experiments, which is superior to radial sampling as input for processing by a multidimensional discrete Fourier transform. Here, we report the extension of this approach to 4-D spectroscopy as Randomized Concentric Shell Sampling (RCSS), where sampling points for the indirect dimensions are positioned on concentric shells, and where random rotations in the angular space are used to avoid coherent artifacts. With simulations, we show that RCSS produces a very low level of artifacts, even with a very limited number of sampling points. The RCSS sampling patterns can be adapted to fine rectangular grids to permit use of the Fast Fourier Transform in data processing, without an apparent increase in the artifact level. These artifacts can be further reduced to the noise level using the iterative CLEAN algorithm developed in radioastronomy. We demonstrate these methods on the high resolution 4-D HCCH-TOCSY spectrum of protein G's B1 domain, using only 1.2% of the sampling that would be needed conventionally for this resolution. The use of a multidimensional FFT instead of the slow DFT for initial data processing and for subsequent CLEAN significantly reduces the calculation time, yielding an artifact level that is on par with the level of the true spectral noise.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a chronic syndrome in which pathological cardiac remodeling is an integral part of the disease and mast cell (MC) degranulation-derived mediators have been suggested to play a role in its progression. Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling is a key event in the signal transduction pathway of MC degranulation. We recently found that inhibition of epsilon PKC slows down the progression of hypertension-induced HF in salt-sensitive Dahl rats fed a high-salt diet. We therefore determined whether epsilon PKC inhibition affects MC degranulation in this model. Six week-old male Dahl rats were fed with a high-salt diet to induce systemic hypertension, which resulted in concentric left ventricular hypertrophy at the age of 11 weeks, followed by myocardial dilatation and HF at the age of 17 weeks. We administered epsilon V1-2 an epsilon PKC-selective inhibitor peptide (3 mg/kg/day), delta V1-1 a delta PKC-selective inhibitor peptide (3 mg/kg/day), TAT (negative control: at equirnolar concentration; 1.6 ing/kg/day) or olmesartan (angiotensin receptor blocker JARBI as a positive control; 3 mg/kg/day) between 11 weeks and 17 weeks. Treatment with epsilon V1-2 attenuated cardiac MC degranulation without affecting MC density, myocardial fibrosis, microvessel patency, vascular thickening and cardiac inflammation in comparison to TAT- or delta V1-1-treatment. Treatment with ARB also attenuated MC degranulation and cardiac remodeling, but to a lesser extent when compared to epsilon V1-2. Finally, epsilon V1-2 treatment inhibited MC degranulation in isolated peritoneal MCs. Together, Our data suggest that epsilon PKC inhibition attenuates pathological remodeling in hypertension-induced HF, at least in part, by preventing cardiac MC degranulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Enigmatic structures in the shape of inverted rounded cones are very common in a discrete horizon of the upper Stoner Limestone Member (Stanton Limestone Formation, Lansing Group, Upper Pennsylvanian) in southeastern Nebraska. These structures are 100-300 mm in diameter, but rare, very large examples attain 1300 mm in diameter. On bedding planes, individual structures are conspicuously expressed as groups of concentric rings, some of which appear as low ridges (rugae). At least some of these rings correspond to concentric cone sheets (hollow cones) extending downward into the rock mass; these cone sheets are sometimes separated clearly from each other by discontinuous mud linings or drapes. The largest structures usually have smaller ones nested within them. The Stoner Limestone structures differ from described types of nonbiological and biological conelike structures, yet they must have formed in soft sediment prior to burial. Although they have a superficial similarity to such plug-shaped trace fossils as Conichnus and Conostichus, the purported dwelling traces left by cnidarians, several salient points with respect to shape, structure, and occurrence distinguish the Stoner Limestone structures from such traces. A trace-fossil hypothesis for the origin of the structures remains plausible-possible feeding structures-albeit problematic. Study of the Stoner Limestone concentric-conelike structures indicates that careful reexamination of trace fossils and sedimentary structures in Midconinent Pennsylvanian limestones is in order, as well as a reconsideration of how unique physical and diagenetic properties of carbonate sediments in general might affect the preservation of such features.

AB  - In the context of its responsibilities as a Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for the Southwest Indian Ocean, Meteo-France operates a tropical cyclone warning centre which sends advisories to all the concerned countries in the area. In assistance to the forecasters and as part of the operational suite for the short-range forecasts, a limited-area model (ALADIN Reunion) is run with four daily analyses. Assimilated observations include conventional observations - radiosondes, buoys, surface stations, aircraft reports, upper-wind reports - and satellite observations. The latter include QuikSCAT surface winds, atmospheric motion vectors from geostationary satellites, and radiances from polar-orbiting satellites. Assimilation of satellite radiance data is done in clear-sky conditions, and thus cannot be used in the vicinity of tropical cyclones. Two new sources of pseudo-observations are investigated that can bring new information content to those regions: Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) pseudo-observations deduced from cloudy/rainy SSM/I data, as well as a 3D wind bogus. The TCWV algorithm is obtained from SSM/I brightness temperatures through a simple statistical regression from the ID-Var analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which are derived from complex inversion methods using moist physics and radiative transfer models. The 31) wind bogus is derived from structural information contained in the tropical cyclone advisories issued by the RSMC and contains a low-level vortex composed of two concentric rings of eight winds each, at each of the surface, 850, 700 and 500hPa levels. Forecast scores and fit of the model to the observations are improved and indicate a positive impact of those new datasets. Structural validation is investigated through the comparison of model and TMI 'observed' rain rates: it is found that assimilating and cycling cloudy/rainy TCWV helps achieve more realistic cyclonic features.

AB  - In animal eyes of the camera type longitudinal chromatic aberration causes defocus that is particularly severe in species with short depth of focus. In a variety of vertebrates, multifocal optical systems compensate for longitudinal chromatic aberration by concentric zones of different refractive powers. Since a constricting circular pupil blocks peripheral zones, eyes with multifocal optical systems often have slit pupils that allow light to pass through all zones, irrespective of the state of pupil constriction. Birds have circular pupils and were therefore assumed to have monofocal optical systems. We examined the eyes of 45 species (12 orders) of bird using videorefractometry, and the results are surprising: 29 species (10 orders) have multifocal systems, and only five species (five orders) have monofocal systems. The results from 11 species (four orders) are inconclusive. We propose that pupils 'switching' between being fully opened (multifocal principle) to maximally closed (pinhole principle) can make multifocal optical systems useful for animals with circular pupils. Previous results indicate that mice have both multifocal optical systems and switching pupils. Our results suggest that parrots may use a similar mechanism. By contrast, owl pupils responded weakly to changes in illumination and stayed remarkably wide even in full daylight. Moreover, the parrots opened their pupils at higher light levels than owls, which correlates with the differences in sensitivity between diurnal and nocturnal eyes.

AB  - Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Objective: To evaluate isokinetic shoulder flexor-extensor (F/E) and abductor-adductor (Ab/Ad) torque ratios in individuals with paraplegia using a new interpretative approach. We proposed to study torque ratios according to joint angle sections (15 degrees angle subgroups) over a selected range of motion.
   Setting: Pathokinesiology Laboratory, Montreal, Canada.
   Method: Sixteen individuals with complete motor paraplegia, without shoulder pain or impairment, were included in this study. After a preloading period of 1 s, maximum isokinetic concentric contractions of all muscle groups were completed at 30, 60 and 120 degrees s(-1) over the entire tested ranges of motion (70 to -35 degrees for the flexion-extension and 15 to 60 degrees for the abduction-adduction). After the continuous torque curves were rebuilt, the mean F/E and Ab/Ad torque ratios were calculated and analyzed every 15 degrees.
   Results: A significant modification of the F/E (F = 66.3; P < 0.001) and Ab/Ad (F = 100.6; P < 0.001) torque ratios was observed according to the 15 degrees angle subgroup evaluated. More precisely, a progressive decline of both the F/E and Ab/Ad ratios was noted as the shoulder flexion or abduction progressed. Angular velocity did not have any influence on torque ratio values.
   Conclusion: Angle subgroup torque ratio analysis leads to a better estimation of the balance between the agonist and antagonist muscle groups than does traditional peak torque ratio analysis. In individuals with paraplegia, this precise estimation of torque ratios may lead to the development of specific shoulder strengthening programs to prevent muscle imbalance and its consequences.

AB  - In the present study we investigated the behavioural strategies with which freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila) control their flight trajectories during active optomotor stimulation in a free-flight arena. We measured forward, turning and climbing velocities of single flies using high-speed video analysis and estimated the output of a 'Hassenstein-Reichardt' elementary motion detector (EMD) array and the fly's gaze to evaluate flight behaviour in response to a rotating visual panorama. In a stationary visual environment, flight is characterized by flight saccades during which the animals turn on average 120 degrees within 130 ms. In a rotating environment, the fly's behaviour typically changes towards distinct, concentric circular flight paths where the radius of the paths increases with increasing arena velocity. The EMD simulation suggests that this behaviour is driven by a rotation-sensitive EMD detector system that minimizes retinal slip on each compound eye, whereas an expansion-sensitive EMD system with a laterally centred visual focus potentially helps to achieve centring response on the circular flight path. We developed a numerical model based on force balance between horizontal, vertical and lateral forces that allows predictions of flight path curvature at a given locomotor capacity of the fly. The model suggests that turning flight in Drosophila is constrained by the production of centripetal forces needed to avoid side-slip movements. At maximum horizontal velocity this force may account for up to 70% of the fly's body weight during yaw turning. Altogether, our analyses are widely consistent with previous studies on Drosophila free flight and those on the optomotor response under tethered flight conditions.

AB  - Chromatic dispersion of dual-concentric-core photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), which have an inner low-index core and an outer high-index core, is investigated based on a full vector finite-element method. Large negative dispersion can be obtained by introducing avoided crossing between modes of the two asymmetric cores. While increasing the negative dispersion, larger effective mode area is also possible by choosing a higher order mode in the outer core to couple with the fundamental inner core mode. During the analysis, a dual-core PCF with a dispersion peak value of -36000 ps/(nm . km) and effective mode area of 34.8 mu m(2) is presented.

AB  - Insulin regulates glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) availability at the surface of muscle and adipose cells. In L6 myoblasts, stably expressed GLUT4myc is detected mostly in a perinuclear region. In unstimulated cells, about half of perinuclear GLUT4myc colocalizes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). Insulin stimulation selectively decreased the perinuclear colocalization of GLUT4myc with TtR determined by 3D-reconstruction of fluorescence images. Perinuclear GLUT4myc adopted two main distributions defined morphometrically as 'conical' and 'concentric'. Insulin rapidly reduced the proportion of cells with conical in favor of concentric perinuclear GLUT4myc distributions in association with the gain in surface GLUT4myc. Upon removal of insulin, the GLUT4myc perinuclear distribution and surface levels reversed in parallel. In contrast, hypertonicity (which like insulin elevates surface GLUT4myc) did not elicit perinuclear GLUT4myc redistribution. Insulin also caused redistribution of perinuclear vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP2), without alteration of perinuclear TfR and VAMP3. Inhibitory mutants of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (Ap85) or Akt substrate AS160 (AS160-4P) prevented insulin-mediated perinuclear GLUT4myc redistribution. Tetanus toxin expression did not prevent the perinuclear GLUT4myc redistribution, suggesting that redistribution is independent of GLUT4myc fusion with the plasma membrane. We propose that insulin causes selective, dynamic relocalization of perinuclear GLUT4myc and VAMP2 and perinuclear GLUT4myc redistribution is a direct target of insulin-derived signals.

AB  - The properties of special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) enable them to be designed to meet performance-based seismic design (PBSD) criteria. SCBFs have large stiffness and strength to meet serviceability performance states. Life-safety and collapse-prevention PBSD limit states are controlled by inelastic postbuckling and tensile yield deformation of the brace. In SCBF construction, the braces are connected to the frame using gusset plates. Inelastic deformation of the brace places severe inelastic demands on gusset-plate connections. To improve the understanding and design of the seismic performance of SCBF connections, a coordinated analytical and experimental research study was undertaken. This paper describes the analytical component and includes a brief description of the experimental results, which were used in the development and validation of the model. The validated model was used to evaluate the inelastic performance of structural elements and to determine the frame ductility and concentration of plastic strains at potential locations of member or weld tearing or fracture. Detailed comparisons between experimental observations and computed results show that the analyses provided good correlation to actual behavior. The results were used to develop a methodology to predict tearing or cracking of key elements in the frame.

AB  - Dolomite cement is a significant and widespread component of Phanerozoic sucrosic dolomites. Cements in dolomites that were never deeply buried are limpid, have planar faces (non-saddle forms), often distinct zonation in cathodoluminescence and form syntaxial overgrowths on crystals facing pores. Five samples of sucrosic dolomites, interpreted as having had mostly lime-mudstone or wackestone precursors in four carbonate aquifers, provide insights into the abundance of planar cements in sucrosic dolomites. Such cement comprises 11% to 45% (32% mean) of peritidal to sub-tidal dolomites on an outcrop in the Edwards aquifer (Early Cretaceous) of central Texas; 19% to 33% (25% mean) of ramp dolomites in the Hawthorn Group (Oligo-Miocene) and 50% to 70% in shelf dolomites of the Avon Park Formation (Eocene) in the Upper Floridan aquifer of sub-surface peninsular Florida; 18% to 45% (32+% mean) of sub-tidal shelf dolomites in quarry sections of the Burlington-Keokuk Formation (Early Mississippian) in south-eastern Iowa; and 18% to 76% (50% mean) in shallow cores and outcrops of outer-shelf dolomites from the Gambier Limestone (Oligo-Miocene) of South Australia. Backstripping the cement phases revealed by cathodoluminescence colour photomicrographs documents the effects of cements on textural coarsening, pore-space reduction, induration and general 'maturation' of these dolomites. Most pre-Holocene dolomites are multiphase crystalline rocks composed of: (i) seed crystals or 'cores'; (ii) crystal cortices that concentrically enlarged the cores; and (iii) free-space, syntaxial precipitates of limpid cement around the crystals. Remaining CaCO3 grains and micrite can be replaced by dolomite, but typically they are dissolved between stages (ii) and (iii), creating systems of intercrystal and mouldic pores typical of sucrosic dolomites. Networks of cement overgrowths, aided by water-filled pore systems under hydrostatic to lithostatic pressure, are judged to slow or prevent compaction in sucrosic dolomites. It can be argued that cortex growth involves both replacement of CaCO3 particles and microcementation of their interparticle pores. This interpretation, and the abundance of cements in so many dolomites, would obviate the controversy over the volumetrics of 'replacement dolomitization'. Limpid, planar and syntaxial dolomite cements of early diagenetic origin are interpreted to have precipitated from clear pore waters, at low temperatures (< 30 to 35 degrees C) and shallow burial depths (< 100 m), in water-saturated networks of dolomite 'silt' and 'sand'. Cements in many dolomites in island and continental-aquifer systems appear to result from event-driven processes related to sea-level highstands. Cementation events can follow 'replacement dolomitization' events by time intervals ranging from geologically 'instantaneous' to tens of million years.

AB  - Organisms are inherently modular, yet modules also evolve in response to selection for functional integration or functional specialization of traits. For serially repeated homologous traits, there is a clear expectation that selection on the function of individual traits will reduce the integration between traits and subdivide a single ancestral module. The eyespots on butterfly wings are one example of serially repeated morphological traits that share a common developmental mechanism but are subject to natural and sexual selection for divergent functions. Here, I test two hypotheses about the organization of the eyespot pattern into independent dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior modules, using a graphical modeling technique to examine patterns of eyespot covariation among and within wing surfaces in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Although there is a hierarchical and complex pattern of integration among eyespots, the results show a surprising mismatch between patterns of eyespot integration and the developmental and evolutionary eyespot units identified in previous empirical studies. These results are discussed in light of the relationships between developmental, functional, and evolutionary modules, and they suggest that developmental sources of independent trait variation are often masked by developmental sources of trait integration.

AB  - Serially repeated pattern elements on butterfly wings offer the opportunity for integrating genetic, developmental, and functional aspects towards understanding morphological diversification and the evolution of individuality. We use captive populations of Bicyclus anynana butterflies, an emerging model in evolutionary developmental biology, to explore the genetic and developmental basis of compartmentalized changes in eyespot patterns. There is much variation for different aspects of eyespot morphology, and knowledge about the genetic pathways and developmental processes involved in eyespot formation. Also, despite the strong correlations across all eyespots in one butterfly, B. anynana shows great potential for independent changes in the size of individual eyespots. It is, however, unclear to what extent the genetic and developmental processes underlying eyespot formation change in a localized manner to enable such individualization. We use micromanipulations of developing wings to dissect the contribution of different components of eyespot development to quantitative differences in eyespot size on one wing surface. Reciprocal transplants of presumptive eyespot foci between artificial selection lines and controls suggest that while localized antagonistic changes in eyespot size rely mostly on localized changes in focal signal strength, concerted changes depend greatly on epidermal response sensitivities. This potentially reflects differences between the signal-response components of eyespot formation in the degrees of compartmentalization and/or the temporal pattern of selection. We also report on the phenotypic analysis of a number of mutant stocks demonstrating how single alleles can affect different eyespots in concert or independently, and thus contribute to the individualization of serially repeated traits.

AB  - Frictional drag reduction due to the presence of small bubbles is investigated experimentally using a Couette-Taylor flow system; i.e., shear flow between concentric cylinders. Torque and bubble behavior are measured as a function of Reynolds number up to Re = 5000 while air bubbles are injected constantly and rise through an array of vortical cells. Silicone oil is used to avoid the uncertain interfacial property of bubbles and to produce nearly monosized bubble distributions. The effect of drag reduction on sensitivity and power gain are assessed. The sensitivity exceeds unity at Re < 2000, proving that the effect of the reduction in drag is greater than that of the reduction in mixture density. This is due to the accumulation of bubbles toward the rotating inner cylinder, which is little affected by turbulence. The power gain, which is defined by the power saving from the drag reduction per the pumping power of bubble injection, has a maximum value of O (10) at higher Re numbers around 2500. An image processing measurement shows this is because of the disappearance of azimuthal waves when the organized bubble distribution transforms from toroidal to spiral modes. Moreover, the axial spacing of bubble clouds expands during the transition, which results in an effective reduction in the momentum exchange. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - This paper describes the design and development of a new specific RF probe dedicated for the MRI of both proton (H-1) and hyperpolarized Xenon-29 (HP Xe-129) in the rat brain This probe consists of a double-tuned (100 MHz-27 MHz) volume coil, that could be used for both transmitting and receiving, and of a receive-only simple-tuned (27 MHz). The receive-only coil is a surface coil which is decoupled form the volume coil by an active decoupling circuitry based on the use of PIN diodes. The double-tuned volume coil consists of two concentric birdcage resonators. the inner one is of type low-pass and tuned to 27 MHz, while the outer one, tuned to 100 MHz, is of type high-pass. A transmit/Receive (T/R) driver was realized to bias the PIN diodes in both volume and surface coils.
   The developed prototype was validated at 100 MHz and at 26.4 MHz. Fist obtained MRI images show the feasibility of our approach.

AB  - Free-fall gas atomizers are often used for liquid solution and melt atomization in the area of powder production and spray forming applications. This external mixing atomizer often uses two separate gas nozzle systems, namely, a primary gas nozzle (for prevention of major gas recirculation flow in the atomization area) and a secondary gas nozzle (for atomization), both concentrically surrounding the central liquid jet. Due to this specific arrangement, the atomization area is separated from the atomizer body, however the primary and secondary gas pressures need to be carefully adjusted. To improve the free-fall atomizer construction and operating conditions, the gas flow field of a conventional free-fall atomizer was investigated by numerical simulations. Aim of the investigation was to economize the primary gas application, while safely operating the atomizer without recirculations. Advantages of the derived flow-adapted atomizer design are a reduction in gas consumption, as well as the potential of generation of smaller particles. This effect was proven by atomization of a viscous melt.

AB  - Today, the farming community is very dependent on effective fungicides being available in order to stabilize yields and reduce the losses from the development of disease epidemics in cereals. Common practice in many countries is to spray winter wheat two to three times per season and barley crops one to two times depending on the cultivar and disease severity. Currently, wheat often responds by between 1 to 2 t ha(-1) for fungicide control measures and barley by 0.5-1.0 t ha(-1) depending on weather and disease pressure.
   Intensive use of fungicides for control of major diseases in wheat like septoria leaf blotch, (Mycosphaerella graminicola), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and eyespot (Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis) has over the years been found to give rise to development of fungicide resistance in relation to benzimidazols, DMIs and strobilurins. In barley, changes have been seen for powdery mildew, scald (Rhynchosporium secalis) and net blotch (Pyrenophora teres). Today, the main fungicides for disease control in cereals are triazols, strobiturins, morpholines and carboxamides and chlorothalonil.
   The major changes seen in sensitivity to fungicides make it highly relevant and essential to follow the development of fungicide resistance in order to be able to adjust recommendations and avoid unnecessary use of fungicides which are no longer effective.

AB  - In this paper, a digital watermarking system based on vector quantization is presented. Each vector containing N samples is mapped on the surface of the hyperspheres each of which are associated with a message to embed the digital watermark. We called this method Vector Quantization Index Modulation (VQIM) since it is conventional QIM in the N-dimensional space. The performance of the method and its comparison to orthogonal code-based watermarking is investigated. Furthermore, we implemented the VQIM method on a real audio watermarking system and adopted it with the human auditory system. The experimental results show the robustness of this scheme against common attacks in audio watermarking such as MP3 compression, lowpass filtering, resampling etc.

Observers are instructed to report either a transparent patch over an opaque bipartite field or a mosaic of four opaque patches. We show theoretically and empirically that these are only two of five generic perceptual categories, namely, transparent patch, transparent annulus (hole), mosaic, partial transparency, and multiple transparency (ambiguous) cases. Thus Gestalt factors complicate the interpretation "phenomenal transparency." We propose a framework that avoids this complication. There is excellent agreement between predictions and results.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of eccentric hamstring training on strength measures and vertical jumping performance.
   Methods: 26 male basketball players aged 10-12 were divided into Nordic Hamstring Strength Training group (N = 15) and control group ( N = 11). Training was conducted over a 5-week period during which both groups participated in basketball training. All participants underwent pre- and post-training testing comprising isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee extension and flexion strength and vertical jump performance.
   Results: The NHST group exhibited significant increase in eccentric hamstring strength (p < 0.05) and vertical jumping ability (p < 0.01) whereas the performance of the control group remained unchanged during that period.
   Conclusion: Including eccentric exercises into entire training program improve muscular strength and can help athletes to reach their highest potential so they produce greater muscular forces.

AB  - The present study was conducted to test for developmental integration and independence of the eyespots in the wings of the nymphalid butterfly Ypthima lisandra;Cramer 1792 by examining whether or not departures from symmetry co-vary among eyespot traits. In order to do this, trait asymmetry values (R-L) of eyespot characters were subjected to Spearman and Kendall's tests for rank correlations and to least squares linear regression. Results showed no clear-cut significant associations in trait asymmetry values of the eyespots found between the fore- and hind wings. Also, no trait co-variation was found between eyespots within each of the fore- and hind wings. Only the black and. gold ring elements of individual eyespots were shown to co-vary. The results of this study are suggestive of developmental independence of the different eyespots in Y. lisandra. Implications of the results of the study are discussed in the light of the diversification of butterfly wing elements.

AB  - Fault rings can be used to guide messages bypass faulty nodes/links in a fault tolerant interconnection network. However, nodes on the fault ring become hot spots, thus causing uneven distribution of the traffic loads. To avoid such traffic congestion, a concept of the balanced ring is proposed in this paper. The proposed balanced ring, defined as concentric rings of a given fault ring, can be applied to the fault tolerant routing algorithms for mesh and torus topologies. By properly guiding messages to route on the balanced ring and the fault ring, more balanced link utilization and greatly reduced traffic congestion can be achieved on a fault tolerant network. Methods of applying the balanced ring concept to some published fault tolerant routing algorithms are discussed. Proof of deadlock and livelock freedom is also presented. The use of balanced ring does not need to add new virtual channels. The performance of two routing algorithms with and without the balanced ring is simulated and evaluated. The results indicate that routing algorithms with the balanced rings constantly yield larger throughput and smaller latency than those without. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to compare the behavioural profiles in alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, alcohol) and alcohol-avoiding ANA (Alko, non-alcohol) rats. Twelve adult, alcohol-native male AA and ANA rats were tested in the recently established multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) test. The more traditional open field and elevated plus-maze tests were used as reference tests. Six weeks after the initial MCSF test, a repeated testing was used to explore differences in acquired recognition after a previous experience. The results revealed distinct differences between the two lines. The ANA rats were generally more active in the three tests. In the MCSF, parameters of risk taking and shelter seeking indicated differences between the two lines. The ANA rats had higher shelter seeking behaviour and less risk taking behaviour than the AA rats. Repeated exposure to the MCSF caused a general decrease in activity and reduction in the number of visits to the various zones, especially evident in the ANA rats. The ANA rats showed more shelter seeking than the AA rats and also more shelter seeking than in the first trial, supporting an "anxiety-like" profile in these rats. In conclusion, the parameters related to risk taking and shelter seeking revealed obvious differences between AA and ANA rats. The higher risk taking behaviour seen in the AA rats might relate to their innate propensity for high voluntary alcohol intake. The results are discussed in relation to the reported neurobiological differences and in relation to other alcohol-preferring and alcohol-avoiding rat lines. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previously, we reported that an isometric resistance training program that was effective in stimulating muscle hypertrophy in ambulatory rats could not completely prevent muscle atrophy during unloading (Haddad F, Adams GR, Bodell PW, Baldwin KM. J Appl Physiol 100: 433-441, 2006). These results indicated that preventing muscle atrophy does not appear to be simply a function of providing an anabolic stimulus. The present study was undertaken to determine if resistance training, with increased volume (3-s contractions) and incorporating both static and dynamic components, would be effective in preventing unloadinginduced muscle atrophy. Rats were exposed to 5 days of muscle unloading via tail suspension. During that time one leg received electrically stimulated resistance exercise (RE) that included an isometric, concentric, and eccentric phase. The results of this study indicate that this combined-mode RE provided an anabolic stimulus sufficient to maintain the mass and myofibril content of the trained but not the contralateral medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle. Relative to the contralateral MG, the RE stimulus increased the amount of total RNA (indicative of translational capacity) as well as the mRNA for several anabolic/ myogenic markers such as insulin-like growth factor-I, myogenin, myoferlin, and procollagen III-alpha-1 and decreased that of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle size. The combined-mode RE protocol also increased the activity of anabolic signaling intermediates such as p70S6 kinase. These results indicate that a combination of static-and dynamic-mode RE of sufficient volume provides an effective stimulus to stimulate anabolic/ myogenic mechanisms to counter the initial stages of unloading-induced muscle atrophy.

AB  - Heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide TiO2 is an advanced oxidation processes that uses ultraviolet radiation to carry out reactions leading to the degradation of polluting agents in water. For the development and scaling up of efficient photocatalytic processes it is important to model the transport of radiation in the reactor volume, because it affects the photo reaction. In the present work we have used the P1 approximation of radiative transfer theory to evaluate radiation distributions inside a specific annular photocatalytic reactor known as Photo CREC-Water II. The reactor consists of two concentric tubes with a TiO2/water suspension flowing axially in the annular space between them, and a lamp at the center of the inner tube. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from measurements of radiation transmission through several observation windows in the external reactor wall. In general the model describes the observed experimental results well. Due to the nature of the employed approximation a good quantitative agreement is possible only for suspensions with a large optical depth. For small optical depths the agreement is adequate only for the central portion of the reactor length.

AB  - Enigmatic discoidal fossils are common in Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences and in the stratigraphic record pre-date the first appearance of diverse Ediacaran fossil assemblages. Termed 'medusoids', these Neoproterozoic discoidal fossils have generally been interpreted as coelenterate-grade organisms implying a radially symmetrical body plan for ancestral eumetazoans. Analysis of exceptionally preserved discoidal fossils from the White Sea area, however, indicates that most of these discoidal forms represent colonial microbes. Localized pyritization, for example, reveals the presence of a conspicuous filamentous substructure in Ediacaria, whereas concentric rings, radial sectors and central structures in Cyclomedusa and Paliella compare directly with Recent microbial colonies growing in a nutritionally heterogeneous environment. At least some Ediacaran discoids can be compared with extant concentric ring-shaped microbial colonies that grow in hypersaline microbial mats. Insofar as most of the remaining record of Ediacaran discoids can be attributed to the holdfast structures of non-radiate modular organisms, there is no support from the fossil record for identifying a radiate ancestry for the Metazoa.

AB  - Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment known to date for end-stage liver disease occurring as a result of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Here, we report a case in which living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for PSC was cancelled because of histological abnormalities in intraoperative biopsy of the donor liver. The donor was the mother of the recipient, and her preoperative evaluation revealed no abnormalities. In the donor operation, the donor liver biopsy revealed expansion of the portal zone with lymphocytic infiltration and dense concentric fibrosis developed around a bile duct. These histological findings were identical to those of early-stage PSC; therefore, the LDLT was called off. The experience in this case suggests that preoperative liver biopsy may be useful to exclude first-degree relative donors with potential PSC prior to LDLT for PSC.

AB  - We report 4 cases of pseudomesotheliornatous carcinoma of the lung, which has clinical and microscopic features similar to malignant mesotheliorna, but with ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics suggestive of a histogenesis from type 11 pneumocytes. Neoplasm grows as a diffuse or solid pattem of large polygonal cells with sharply defined borders. Hale's colloidal iron is positive in the cytoplasm of small groups of cells and, focally, in some intercellular spaces. Ultrastructure showed short microvilli in the surface. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, podoplanin, mesothelin, pan-cytokeratin, CK-7, CK-19, Ber-EP4, epithelial membrane antigen, apoprotein surfactant A, epidermal growth factor receptor, Leu-M1, carcinoembryonic antigen, E-cadherin, and CD-44 and negative for mesothelioma markers thrombomodulin and calretinin. In some areas, there were small cysts which contained a concentric fibrilar basophilic material apoprotein surfactant A positive. Chromosomal imbalances with comparative genomic hybridization technique were identified with a median of 15 abnormalities per case (range, 1-26): 5 1 gains, 6 losses, and I high-level amplification. The most frequent aberrations among the cases were gains on chromosomes regions 1q, 3q, 5p, 8q, 16p, and 18q and losses in 17p11-13 and 17q 22-q25. High-level amplifications were detected on 7p13-p21. In all cases, there was a characteristic association between the gains on 16p and those on 18q. The 4 cases resulted in death in less than 14 months, in spite of complete surgery and chemotherapy in 2 cases. Our aim is to complement the current understanding of this pseudoinesotheliomatous m; "pneumocytic" carcinoma and alert pathologists to this rare entity to avoid misdiagnosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We investigated both the phenotypic and developmental integration of eyespots on the fore- and hindwings of speckled wood butterflies Pararge aegeria. Eyespots develop within a framework of wing veins, which may not only separate eyespots developmentally, but may at the same time also integrate them by virtue of being both signalling sources and barriers during eyespot development. We therefore specifically investigated the interaction between wing venation patterns and eyespot integration. Phenotypic covariation among eyespots was very high, but only eyespots in neighbouring wing cells and in homologous wing cells on different wing surfaces were developmentally integrated. This can be explained by the fact that the wing cells of these eyespots share one or more wing veins. The wing venation patterns of fore- and hindwings were highly integrated, both phenotypically and developmentally. This did not affect overall developmental integration of the eyespots. The adaptive significance of integration patterns is discussed and more specifically we stress the need to conduct studies on phenotypic plasticity of integration.

AB  - R,S(+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (R,S(+/-)-MDMA, 'Ecstasy') is known to stimulate dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In order to investigate the post-synaptic correlates of pre-synaptic changes in DA transmission and their relationship with MDMA enantiomers, we studied the effects of R,S(+/-)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA, and R(-)-MDMA on extracellular DA and phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (pERK) in the NAc shell and core. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, implanted with a catheter in the femoral vein and vertical concentric dialysis probes in the NAc shell and core, were administered i.v. saline, R,S(+/-)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA, or R(-)-MDMA. Extracellular DA was monitored by in vivo microdialysis with HPLC. Intravenous R,S(+/-)-MDMA (0.64, 1, and 2 mg/kg) increased dialysate DA, preferentially in the shell, in a dose-related manner. S(+)-MDMA exerted similar effects but at lower doses than R,S(+/-)-MDMA, while R(-)-MDMA (1 and 2 mg/kg) failed to affect dialysate DA. R,S(+/-)- and S(+)-MDMA but not R(-)-MDMA increased ERK phosphorylation (expressed as density/neuron and number of pERK-positive neurons/area) in both subdivisions of the NAc. The administration of the D-1 receptor antagonist, SCH 39166, prevented the increase in pERK elicited by R,S(+/-)-MDMA and S(+)-MDMA, while the D-2/3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, increased pERK in the NAc core per se but failed to affect the R,S(+/-)-MDMA-elicited stimulation of pERK. The present results provide evidence that the DA stimulant effects of racemic MDMA are accounted for by the S(+)-enantiomer and that pERK may represent a post-synaptic correlate of the stimulant effect of R,S(+/-)-MDMA on D-1-dependent DA transmission.

AB  - The zebrafish has become an important vertebrate model organism to study the development of the visual system. Mutagenesis projects have resulted in the identification of hundreds of eye mutants. Analysis of the phenotypes of these mutants relies on in depth knowledge of the embryogenesis in wild-type animals. While the morphological events leading to the formation of the retina and its connections to the central nervous system have been described in great detail, the characterization of the development of the eye lens is still incomplete. In the present study, we provide a morphological description of embryonic and larval lens development as well as adult lens morphology in the zebrafish. Our analyses show that, in contrast to other vertebrate species, the zebrafish lens delaminates from the surface ectoderm as a solid cluster of cells. Detachment of the prospective lens from the surface ectoderm is facilitated by apoptosis. Primary fibre cell elongation occurs in a circular fashion resulting in an embryonic lens nucleus with concentric shells of fibres. After formation of a monolayer of lens epithelial cells, differentiation and elongation of secondary lens fibres result in a final lens morphology similar to that of other vertebrate species. As in other vertebrates, secondary fibre cell differentiation includes the programmed degradation of nuclei, the interconnection of adjacent fibres via protrusions at the fibre cells' edges and the establishment of gap junctions between lens fibre cells. The very close spacing of the nuclei of the differentiating secondary fibres in a narrow zone close to the equatorial epithelium, however, suggests that secondary fibre cell differentiation deviates from that described for mammalian or avian tenses. In summary, while there are similarities in the development and final morphology of the zebrafish lens with mammalian and avian lenses, there are also significant differences, suggesting caution when extrapolating findings on the zebrafish to, for example, human lens development or function.

AB  - Background: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the pre-eminent cause of late cardiac allograft failure. It is characterized by a concentric intimal hyperplasia, which we designate transplant intimal hyperplasia (TIH). To date, blockade of the adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) has been shown to be effective in preventing TIH in experimental models of transplantation, but only when combined with other immunosuppressants. In this study we explored the impact of monotherapy against LFA-1 in a carotid artery allograft model of TIH.
   Methods: B10A(2R) (H-2(b2)) mice were used as donors and C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice used as recipients. The recipients were treated with a monoclonal antibody against LFA-lot (M17/4) or isotype-matched control immunoglobutin. Grafts were harvested after 35 days and analyzed by histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. Blood samples were taken and analyzed by differential cell count and alloantibody levels.
   Results: We found that treatment with M17/4 resulted in a significant reduction in TIH compared with controls. Immunostaining revealed that LFA-1 alpha blockade inhibited CD45(+) leukocyte infiltration, prevented intimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and preserved the medial SMC population. Finally, we demonstrated a reduction in the serum alloantibody titer in the group treated with anti-LFA-lot when compared with controls.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that LFA-la blockade on its own can prevent development of TIH in an experimental model. The concept of modulating LFA-lo.-mediated leukocyte migration and T-cell activation may therefore be of relevance to clinical cardiac transplantation and, as such, represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention against clinical CAV.

AB  - Animals possess a range of defensive markings to reduce the risk of predation, including warning colours, camouflage, eyespots and mimicry. These different strategies are frequently considered independently, and with little regard towards predator vision, even though they may be linked in various ways and can be fully understood only in terms of predator perception. For example, camouflage and warning coloration need not be mutually exclusive, and may frequently exploit similar features of visual perception. This paper outlines how different forms of protective markings can be understood from predator perception and illustrates how this is fundamental in determining the mechanisms underlying, and the interrelation between, different strategies. Suggestions are made for future work, and potential mechanisms discussed in relation to various forms of defensive coloration, including disruptive coloration, eyespots, dazzle markings, motion camouflage, aposernatism and mimicry.

AB  - The growth and elaboration of neural processes underpins the establishment of neural architecture during development and is a key facet of neural plasticity throughout life. Sholl analysis is a valuable and widely used method for quantifying the extent and complexity of neural processes in the vicinity of the neuronal soma, such as the dendritic arbors of individual neurons in vivo and neuritic arbors of individual neurons in vitro. It consists of tracing a series of concentric rings with regular radial increments centred in the neuronal soma and counting the number Xi of processes intersecting each ring. This is a laborious and time-consuming procedure that consequently can only be applied to relatively small numbers of neurons. We propose a simpler and accurate method for deriving exactly the same information based only on the relative position, with respect to the cell soma, of the bifurcation (B-i) and terminal points (T-i) of processes. By means of the iterative equation X-i = Xi-1 + B-i - T-i, it is possible to automatically reconstruct the complete pattern of intersections between neurites and the concentric rings. We compared our method with the conventional Sholl analysis and found that our simplified procedure is approximately five times faster permitting numerically larger samples to be analyzed. We further tested the sensitivity of our method of analysis by looking at the effect of preventing NF-kappa B signaling on BDNF-dependent neuritic growth in sensory neurons. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Use of the word "popular" attached to the term "religion" or "Catholicism" is quite current in the area of the social sciences. Those terms tend to introduce a dichotomy in the field of religion. Despite all the warnings and recognition of the fact that it is a problematic epithet, most researchers still use it. Yet, and in opposition to that position, this work intends to show that a dichotomic view of Brazilian Catholicism fails to grasp all its dynamics and the tension between its plurality and its universality. Based on ethnographic experience among Catholics of the Casa Amarela neighbourhood (Recife-Brazil), and in establishing a dialogue with the literature produced on this subject, we herein propose a model of comprehension that aims to go beyond the usual dichotomic approach to this religion. This is done on the basis of an outlook wherein Brazilian Catholicism is seen as a concentric Catholicism.

AB  - This study seeks to understand the spatial variability of monthly and daily rainfall in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, USA. Monthly spatial statistics are needed to improve downscaling from climate models producing seasonal rainfall forecasts, and spatial correlation of daily rainfall is needed to inform spatial weather generators used in climate risk analysis. We first determined the historical record length that is stationary followed by an analysis of the monthly spatial characteristics of rainfall variables. Rainfall data from 523 weather stations (National Climate Data Center) were obtained for the period 1915-2004 and divided into 15-year subsets for comparisons. Differences in rainfall were found between the most recent 15-year period and all others occurring during the 90-year period of record. Thus only data from 1990 to 2004 (208 weather stations) were used to avoid the detected changes in climate in the region. Correlation, covariance and variance matrices of daily and monthly rainfall amounts were calculated at monthly steps. The same statistics were also computed for frequency of rainfall events and monthly number of rainy days. Results show different spatial patterns at different temporal scales; two spatial patterns were well established. A widely spread correlation in a northeast - southwest direction was found around weather stations during the frontal rainy season, and a concentric short distance-decay in correlations existed around weather stations during the summer convective season. Spatial correlations among daily rainfall amounts are needed for spatial weather generators in a storm-by-storm basis while monthly spatial statistics are needed to ensure the validity of downscaled data from numerical seasonal rainfall forecasts.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, firugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and post dispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover Similarly, the magnitude of firugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration.

AB  - Urban sprawl is characterized by haphazard patchwork of development, which leads to an improper development in any city. To prevent this kind of sprawl in future, it is necessary. to monitor the growth of the city. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present study to monitor the urban growth over a period of time by employing Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques in conjunction with Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a measure to determine the compactness or dispersion of built-up land growth in the urban areas. The growth patterns of urban built-up land have been studied initially by dividing the area into four zones. The observations have been made with respect to each zone. Then, the study area has been divided into concentric circles of 1 km buffers and the growth patterns have been studied based on urban built-up density with respect to each circular buffer in all four zones. These observations have been integrated with road network to check the influence of infrastructure on haphazard urban growth. It has been found from the study that Shannon entropy is a good measure to determine the spatial concentration or dispersion of built-up land in the city. The study also proved the potential of RS and GIS techniques in the spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth trends and their consequences in the lands adjoining to urban areas.

AB  - Most of designs for water machine just consider normal people's demands, but the demands of the disabled, for example, the demands and inconvenience of the blind people while using the water machine. This research considered inconvenience of the blind when they use the water machine. We redesigned multiple intelligent functions in a traditional off-the-shelf water machine, including LED display for the temperature of water output, different fixed volume of water output, multi-language voice output for the temperature level and the volume of water output, voice warning for the minimum limit and the maximum limit of the water line in the tank, buttons with braille hints, redundant water collector with concentric circles fillisters designed for the blind to find the outlet position conveniently etc. This intelligent water machine we developed is not only convenient to use for the blind, but also for normal user. It is safer, convenient and so sweet when people use the intelligent drinking water machine.

KW  - STRAIN-RATE
AB  - Recent researches point to the great potential of the sandwich pipe conception for ultra deepwater exploitation and production of oil and natural gas. Its configuration is very simple and comprises two concentric metallic pipes with a core material, polymeric or ceramic, in the annulus. The main functions of the annular layer are: to provide satisfactory thermal insulation so as to avoid the formation of wax and hydrates along the pipeline during production shutdown; to improve the overall structural strength of the system. Polypropylene and cement have been recently proposed for these applications. The reason for the choice of these materials was the low cost and the extensive availability in industry. Here a systematic material selection approach is employed in order to assess the applicability of other polymeric materials. The attributes of materials needed to meet the design specification are thoroughly studied. The list of possible materials was enlarged and the modified digital logic approach is used with the purpose to define a top group of materials for further numerical comparative study. Finite element analyses are carried out to assess the structural strength of the sandwich pipe under pure external pressure or longitudinal bending and combined external pressure and bending. Additionally, the effect of thermal gradient is included to the numerical analyses to evaluate each pre-selected material of the top group. Results indicate that other potential materials such as PEEK and polycarbonate can improve the structural performance of the sandwich pipe conception and yet meet other several design criteria.

AB  - Eddy current proximity probes are used extensively for monitoring shaft vibration of large motors and generators, especially those manufactured to American Petroleum Institute specifications [1] [2]. It is important to minimize proximity probe track runout, which is also known as slow roll runout, so as to minimize the measurement error when monitoring and diagnosing vibration. Customer specifications strive to reduce the slow roll runout in order to improve the reliability of the vibration signal: The slow roll runout specification is recognized as one of the more difficult requirements to meet on a consistent basis. If the runout specification is not met during final test of a machine, it can cause critical delays in delivery and impact project completion. Manufacturers are developing strategies to provide motors and generators with the lowest possible runout, consistently and on time. This paper describes a factory measurement method used during the manufacturing process that is able to discriminate the four major components of runout: journal surface out of roundness, proximity probe track out of roundness, lack of concentricity of the two surfaces, and electrical runout. With accurate knowledge of each of the components of slow roll runout, manufacturers have the ability to control and improve them. With today's aggressive project timelines, on-time delivery is vital. Diagnosing issues early in the manufacturing process allows steps to be taken to mitigate problems before machine assembly. This minimizes the likelihood of having to disassemble the machine to correct excessive runout and avoids the associated schedule delay. This is essential for critical machines and especially those that are schedule driven. Results from this in-process measurement method are also compared with final test stand results.

KW  - DECOMPOSITION
AB  - The hybridization of optimization techniques can exploit the strengths of different approaches and avoid their weaknesses. In this work we present a hybrid optimization algorithm based on the combination of Evolution Strategies (ES) and Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR). In this hybrid a local algorithm (LWLR) proposes a new solution that is used by a global algorithm (ES) to produce new better solutions. This new hybrid is applied in solving an interesting and difficult problem in astronomy, the two-dimensional fitting of brightness profiles in galaxy images.
   The use of standardized fitting functions is arguably the most powerful method for measuring the large-scale features (e.g. brightness distribution) and structure of galaxies, specifying parameters that can provide insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we employ the hybrid algorithm ES+LWLR to find models that describe the bi-dimensional brightness profiles for a set of optical galactic images. Models are created using two functions: de Vaucoleurs and exponential, which produce models that are expressed as sets of concentric generalized ellipses that represent the brightness profiles of the images.
   The problem can be seen as an optimization problem because we need to minimize the difference between the flux from the model and the flux from the original optical image, following a normalized Euclidean distance. We solved this optimization problem using our hybrid algorithm ES+LWLR. We have obtained results for a set of 100 galaxies, showing that hybrid algorithm is very well suited to solve this problem.

AB  - We present the development and demonstration of a novel technique for microscopic analysis of urine particles. Casts and crystals in urine are indicative of clinically important abnormalities. Current urinalysis techniques using flow cytometry and image analysis are limited by their inability to detect, identify and classify crystals and casts. Casts, crystals and yeast cells reported by current automated urine particle analyzers must be confirmed by a second microscopic review involving a human operator to prevent false positives. Human examination of suspect urine samples is resource intensive and time consuming. We introduce a new imaging method to add functionality for recognition of casts and crystals in urine. Our approach uses a polarization microscopy technique to aid classification of crystals, casts and other urine particles. Crystals and casts in urine exhibit unique interference patterns when imaged using a fixed polarizer and analyzer in a crossed configuration. These interference patterns are a measure of birefringence (retardation angle) of the cast or crystal being imaged. Preliminary experiments indicate that uric acid shows a polarization color, and larger crystals exhibit a series of concentric black lines. We show that these unique 'signatures' when used in conjunction with a hierarchical pattern recognition technique can reliably classify the analytes with improved accuracy. The new imaging technique combined with the classification algorithm can address the shortcomings of current urinalysis techniques; and provide quicker and more accurate results.

AB  - Pigmentation patterns in butterfly wings are one of the most spectacular and vivid examples of pattern formation in biology. In this chapter, we devote our attention to the mechanisms for generating global patterns. We focus on the relationship between pattern forming mechanisms for the fore- and hindwing patterns. Through mathematical modeling and computational analysis of Papilio dardanus and polytes, our results indicate that the patterns formed on the forewing need not correlate to those of the hindwing in the sense that the formation mechanism is the same for both patterns. The independence of pattern formation mechanisms means that the coordination of unified patterns of fore- and hindwings is accidental. This is remarkable, because from Oudemans's principle [10], patterns appearing on the exposed surface of fore- and hindwing at the natural resting position are often integrated to form a composite and unified adaptive pattern with their surrounding environment.

AB  - The projective geometric properties of two principal-axes aligned (PAA) conics in a model plane are investigated in this paper by utilized the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED). We demonstrate that one constraint on the image of the absolute conic (IAC) can be obtained from a single image of two PAA conics even if their parameters are unknown. And if the eccentricity of one of the two conics is given, two constraints on the IAC can be obtained. An important merit of the algorithm using PAA is that it can be employed to avoid the ambiguities when estimating extrinsic parameters in the calibration algorithms using concentric circles. We evaluate the characteristics and robustness of the proposed algorithm in experiments with synthetic and real data.

AB  - Judging by the volume of writings about evolutionary constraints, they are an important topic in evolutionary biology. However, their involvement in shaping patterns of evolutionary change from morphological stasis to adaptive radiation remains contentious. This is at least in part because of the paucity of robust analyses of potential examples of constraints, whether of a more absolute or a relative nature. Here, we argue that what is needed to explore the type of constraints and bias on evolutionary change that may emerge from the way in which phenotypic variation is generated is an integrative approach applied to systems that can be tackled at different levels of biological organization. This is illustrated using research on the evolution of patterns in butterfly wing eyespots that has applied a combination of evolutionary genetics and evo-devo to an emerging model species with the beginnings of a comparative approach to describe patterns of variability among the extant taxa of two species-rich genera.

AB  - The modified Laplacian has been used to move unstructured grids in response to changes in the surface grid for a variety of grid movement applications including store separation, aero-elastic wing deformation and free surface flow simulations. However, the use of the modified Laplacian can result in elements with negative areas/volumes, because it has no inherent mechanism to prevent inversion of elements. In this paper, the use of a modified Laplacian is studied analytically for a two-dimensional problem of deforming the inner circle of two concentric circles and for a three-dimensional problem of deforming the inner sphere of two concentric spheres. By analysing the exact solution for this problem, the amount of translation and deformation of the inner circle that maintains a valid mesh is determined. A general grid movement theorem is presented which determines analytically the maximum allowable deformation before an invalid mesh results. Under certain circumstances, the inner circle and sphere can be expanded until it reaches the outer circle or sphere, while remaining a valid grid, and the inner circle and sphere can be rotated by an extreme amount before failure of the mesh occurs. By choosing the exponent to the modified Laplacian appropriately, extreme deformations for single frequency deformations is possible, although for practical applications where the grid movement has multiple frequencies, choosing the optimal exponent for the modified Laplacian may not be practical or provide much improvement. For grid movement simulations involving rigid body translation and rotation or uniform expansion, the modified Laplacian can yield excellent results, and the optimum choice of the modified Laplacian can be analytically deter-mined for these types of motions, but when there are multiple frequencies in the deformation, the modified Laplacian does not allow much deformation before an invalid grid results.

AB  - Aim. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of volume and intensity of static stretching in a warm-up on explosive force production and range of motion (ROM) of the plantar flexors.
   Methods. Twenty subjects performed 5 warm-ups on different days. The warm-ups contained a 5 min treadmill run and various protocols of 30 s static stretches (SS) of the plantar flexors. Stretching involved dorsi flexion just before the pain threshold, which was considered 100% intensity. The treatments that immediately followed the run were: (i) no other treatment (control); (ii) 1 min SS; (iii) 2 min SS; (iv) 4 min SS; (v) 2 min SS at 90% intensity. Ankle ROM was assessed before and after each warm-up and a concentric calf raise and drop jump (DJ) test was conducted after each warm-up.
   Results. There were no significant differences (P>0.05) in peak force or rate of force production in the explosive calf raise between any of the warm-ups. However the run plus 2 min stretch and the run plus 4 min stretch protocols produced significantly lower (P<0.05) DJ performance (jump height/ground contact time) than the run. The run plus 4 min stretch warm-up also produced a significantly lower DJ score than the run plus 1 min stretch warm-up. There were no significant differences between any of the warm-ups in ankle ROM.
   Conclusions. The addition of 2-4 min of SS at 100% intensity to a run caused an impairment to fast stretch shortening cycle muscle performance. The greater impairment from the 4 min stretching condition supported a volume-effect. Two minutes of stretching at 90% intensity had no significant influence on muscle function. The addition of up to 4 min of SS to a run had no appreciable effect on ankle ROM, possibly because of the prior influence of the run.

AB  - A general closed-form analytical solution is derived for the lapping tracks with its kinematics for the concentric V-groove lapping system. Based on the kinematics, the theoretical prediction in the prediction of the ball-spin angle beta is in very good agreement with the experimental results from the observation of the contact track, where a small slip ratio occurs at the contact points. The lapping tracks on the ball surface for the three contact points are fixed circles, and their lengths of the lapping tracks are linearly proportional to vertical bar sin(theta(1) + beta)vertical bar, vertical bar sin(theta(2) + beta)vertical bar, and vertical bar cos beta vertical bar, respectively. To understand the generation mechanism of spherical surface, the ball is enforced to rotate a certain degree of delta with respect to its previous orientation when it enters the lap again. Results show that the lapped area ratio, Lr, is significantly influenced by the angular speed ratio, w(b)/Omega(b), and delta. When the angular speed ratio is integer and delta is small enough or randomized, the lapped area ratios at the contact points of A, B, and C are linearly proportional to [sin theta + sin(theta + 2 beta)], [sin theta + sin(theta - 2 beta)], and (1 + cos 2 beta), respectively. In practice, if the orientation is randomized as the ball enters the lap again, then the distribution of the lapping tracks are dense after many cycles, and the larger the lapping length in each cycle, the smaller is the number of cycles required to achieve the maximum lapped area ratio. In the geometry design of ball lapping, the V-groove half-angle should be larger than 45 degrees, but to prevent the splash of abrasives, it should be less than 75 degrees. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Muscle weakness experienced in old age has many detrimental consequences for activities of daily life. Given the serious problems presented by weakness in old age, strategies to prevent or mitigate this process are of paramount importance. In recent years resistance training has emerged as an effective method for increasing strength in the elderly. Despite this, little is known regarding the muscular, neural and tendinous adaptations that occur with resistance training in old age. Hence, we have conducted a series of experiments to investigate these adaptations. We have found increases in maximal isometric and concentric torque by 9-37% after resistance training in older people (65-81 years). Associated with these strength gains were increases in agonist muscle neural drive without any change in the co-activation of antagonist muscles. Resistance training can cause increases in muscle size and also adaptations to the internal muscle structure. Tendons of older adults adapt to resistance training by increasing their stiffness and Young's modulus. In conclusion, many of the musculoskeletal factors characterizing ageing can be at least partially mitigated by resistance training. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The peroneus tertius is absent in 5% to 17% of the human white population. The function of the peroneus tertius is eversion and dorsiflexion of the foot. These 2 strength parameters have been identified as important parameters in the development of ankle ligament injuries.
   Hypothesis: Subjects without the peroneus tertius are at higher risk for ankle ligament injuries.
   Study Design: Cohort study (Prevalence); Level of evidence, 1.
   Methods: One hundred physical education students were palpated for the presence of peroneus tertius before the start of their education; they were also isokinetically measured for eversion and dorsiflexion strength. All ankle injuries were registered during 2 years, and exposure to sport was recorded.
   Results: The peroneus tertius was absent in 37 of the 200 subjects (18.5%). In the group with peroneus tertius (n = 163), 21 ankle sprains (12.9%) were observed during the 2-year follow-up. In the group without peroneus tertius (n = 37), 7 ankle sprains (18.9%) were noted. Statistical analysis (Cox regression) showed no significant difference between both groups in the incidence of ankle sprains (P = .335). Comparisons between the group of subjects with peroneus tertius and the group without peroneus tertius concerning the concentric and eccentric isokinetic eversion and the concentric dorsiflexion strength did not attain significance at any tested velocity (P > .05).
   Conclusion: This study shows that subjects without peroneus tertius are not at higher risk for an ankle ligament injury. In addition, subjects without peroneus tertius do not exhibit decreased eversion or dorsiflexion strength.
   Clinical Relevance: This study is the first to clarify the exact contribution of the peroneus tertius within the muscular system around the ankle. As a result, the clinical importance of the peroneus tertius concerning prevention and treatment of ankle ligament injuries is low.

AB  - Stromatoporoids grew on both soft and hard substrates, and recent work revealed primary cavities in Devonian reef systems. We present evidence that stromatoporoids also developed primary cavities in muddy sediments. Stromatoporoids initiated on two categories of material: (1) fine-grained sediment, usually covering large bioclasts; (2) uncovered bioclasts, forming a small area of clean substrate. In both, subsequent growth was previously usually interpreted to be across, and in direct contact with, adjacent fine-grained sediment, itself presumed to be unlithified in most cases. However, stromatoporoid basal surfaces show two types of morphology: (A) smooth, generally curved and flat, and (B) corrugated, with concentric growth rings as minor ridges projecting downwards. Both may be present in different stromatoporoid individuals of the same species. Smooth bases are interpreted in most cases to indicate growth on unlithified sediment, and are common in category 1 above. For corrugated bases, rings are interpreted to result from growth to form minor primary cavities by the stromatoporoid skeleton growing laterally a few mm above the substrate. The base then likely settled into the soft sediment as skeletal mass increased. Primary cavities are interpreted to be similar to those in muddy Devonian facies, but both differ from those in Devonian reefs (e.g. Canning Basin) where cavities may be tens of cm high, and were permanent. In the Silurian samples, a third morphology of concentric basal ring arrangement containing sediment wedges is interpreted as due to episodic sedimentation. Also, stromatoporoids grew on lithified and eroded intraclasts, indicating patchy early lithification of the sea floor in these open shelf settings. Evidence presented from the Silurian examples emphasises the dynamic response of stromatoporoids to their substrate, consistent with sediment-avoiding habits of modern calcified sponges.

AB  - Objective: The agonist-antagonist strength relationship for shoulder external rotation and internal rotation was formerly described by the relatively more functional ratios of eccentric external rotator to concentric internal rotator moments, and eccentric internal rotator to concentric external rotator moments for the entire range of motion. The aim of this study was to provide descriptive data for terminal range eccentric antagonist/concentric agonist rotator cuff strength in overhead athletes. Methods: The dominant and non-dominant shoulders of 40 asymptomatic military overhead athletes were tested through a range of 20 degrees of external rotation to 90 degrees of internal rotation using the Cybex NORM isokinetic dynamometer at a speed of 90 degrees/s. Differences between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders were assessed using the paired samples t-test. Results: The terminal range ratios during external rotation (20 degrees of internal rotation -10 degrees of external rotation) were found to be 2.09 and 1.58 for the dominant and non-dominant shoulders, respectively, whereas the terminal range ratios during internal rotation (60-90 degrees of internal rotation) were 1.03 and 1.19 for the dominant and non-dominant shoulders, respectively. These ratio differences between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders were significant (P < 0.01 for external and internal rotation). Conclusion: The muscle torque ratios of eccentric antagonist/concentric agonist are different between dominant and non-dominant shoulders of skilled overhead athletes at terminal ranges. This functional assessment of strength testing that reflects dynamic shoulder joint stability during the throwing activity at these specific ranges may provide valuable information either during preventive exercise programs or in the evaluation of the injured shoulder of the overhead athlete. We recommended functional exercises that improve eccentric external rotation strength on the dominant shoulder during the rehabilitation and prevention programs in overhead athletes.

AB  - The main purpose of the present paper is to provide a general method of fundamental solution (MFS) formulation for two- and three-dimensional eigenproblems without spurious eigenvalues. The spurious eigenvalues are avoided by utilizing the mixed potential method. Illustrated problems in the annular and concentric domains are studied analytically and numerically to demonstrate the issue of spurious eigenvalues by the discrete and continuous versions of the WS with and without the mixed potential method. The proposed numerical method is then verified with the exact solutions of the benchmark problems in circular and spherical domains with and without holes. Further studies are performed in a three-dimensional peanut shaped domain. In the spirit of the MFS, this scheme is free from meshes, singularities and numerical integrations.

KW  - PLANETS
AB  - This paper summarizes a three-night observing campaign aimed at achieving millimagnitude-precision photometry of bright stars (V < 9.0 mag) with the 1 m Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. The test targets were the main-sequence stars HD 205739 and HD 135446. The results show that by placing a concentric diaphragm in front of the aperture of the telescope, it is possible to avoid saturation and achieve a photometric precision of 0.0008-0.0010 mag per data point, with a cadence of less than 4 minutes. It is also possible to reach an overall precision of less that 0.0015 mag for time series of 6 hr or more. The photometric precision of this setup is only limited by scintillation. Scintillation could be reduced, and therefore the photometric precision further improved, by using a neutral-density filter instead of the aperture stop. Given the expected median depth of about 0.01 mag for extrasolar-planet transits, plus their typical duration of several hours, the results of this paper show that 1 m telescopes equipped with standard CCDs can be used to detect planet transits as shallow as 0.002 mag around bright stars.

AB  - Purpose of review Cardiac transplantation is a recognized therapy for end-stage heart failure. Graft coronary artery disease is a chief determinant of long-term survival following cardiac transplantation. There are multiple purported etiologies for graft coronary artery disease including both immunologic and nonimmunologic factors. Immunologic factors include human leukocyte antigen mismatching, cytokine production, and activation of the cellular immune system. Nonimmunologic factors include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cytomegalovirus infection, just to name a few. There are also donor and recipient factors including age, prior coronary artery disease in the donor heart, and mode of donor brain death.
   Recent findings The diagnosis of graft coronary artery disease is especially difficult, partially due to the de-innervated allograft, as well as to its inherent predilection to affect the medium-sized and smaller arteries in a concentric and diffuse nature. Conventional angiography can overlook this condition because of the lack of eccentric plaques in larger epicardial arteries. Intravascular ultrasonography, by contrast, is more sensitive in detecting graft coronary artery disease but is unable to visualize the entire arterial system. Treatment is challenging and often unrewarding, leading to re-transplantation. Prevention is therefore ideal and involves protection against endothelial injury before and during transplantation as well as after transplantation, with decreased ischemic time, aggressive attention to early rejection, risk factor modification, and close follow-up.
   Summary This review will look at the pathophysiology of graft coronary artery disease, current diagnostic and therapeutic choices, as well as existing and future directions.

AB  - Submarine lavas recovered from the Hilina bench region, offshore Kilauea, Hawaii Island provide information on ancient Kilauea volcano and the geochemical components of the Hawaiian hotspot. Alkalic lavas, including nephelinite, basanite, hawaiite, and alkali basalt, dominate the earliest stage of Kilauea magmatism. Transitional basalt pillow lavas are an intermediate phase, preceding development of the voluminous tholeiitic subaerial shield and submarine Puna Ridge. Most alkalic through transitional lavas are quite uniform in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, supporting the interpretation that variable extent partial melting of a relatively homogeneous source was responsible for much of the geochemical diversity of early Kilauea magmas (Sisson et al., 2002). These samples are among the highest Pb-206/Pb-204 known from Hawaii and may represent melts from a distinct geochemical and isotopic end-member involved in the generation of most Hawaiian tholeiites. This end-member is similar to the postulated literature Kea component, but we propose that it should be renamed Hilina, to avoid confusion with the geographically defined Kea-trend volcanoes. Isotopic compositions of some shield-stage Kilauea tholeiites overlap the Hilina end-member but most deviate far into the interior of the isotopic field defined by magmas from other Hawaiian volcanoes, reflecting the introduction of melt contributions from both "Koolau" (high Sr-87/(86S)r, low Pb-206/Pb-204) and depleted (low Sr-87/Sr-86, intermediate Pb-206/Pb-204) source materials. This shift in isotopic character from nearly uniform, end-member, and alkalic, to diverse and tholeiitic corresponds with the major increase in Kilauea's magmatic productivity. Two popular geodynamic models can account for these relations: (1) The upwelling mantle source could be concentrically zoned in both chemical/isotopic composition, and in speed/extent of upwelling, with Hilina (and Loihi) components situated in the weakly ascending margins and the Koolau component in the interior. The depleted component could be refractory and spread throughout or scavenged from the overlying lithosphere. (2) The Hilina (and Loihi) components could be a more fertile material (lower melting temperature) spread irregularly throughout the Hawaiian source in a matrix of more refractory depleted and Koolau compositions. Modest upwelling along the leading hotspot margin melts the fertile domains predominantly, while the refractory matrix also partially melts in the more vigorously upwelling hotspot interior, diluting the Hilina and Loihi components and yielding voluminous isotopically diverse tholeiitic magmas.

A study of a Madeiran population of the butterfly Pararge aegeria L. (Lepidoptera: Satyrinae) shows that larval crowding affects larval development and growth, with female larvae being more adversely affected than males. It was predicted that if larval crowding increases FA, male and female P. aegeria adults may show different responses to this stress. The FA of five different wing pattern elements on the dorsal hindwings of adult male and female P. aegeria that had been reared at different larval densities was measured. Crowding in P. aegeria resulted in a trait-specific and sex-specific increase in FA. Although a significant correlation between FA and longevity was not observed, there was a significant correlation with egg-laying rate. Stressed females increased their egg-laying rate. An increased egg-laying rate may carry a further fitness cost through the offspring of stressed females, because high egg-laying rates are associated with a decline in oviposition site quality.

CP  - 51st ASME Turbo Expo
AB  - In this paper, flow fields inside a premixed combustor have been investigated by CFD analysis and PIV measurement in a preheating, non-reacting condition. Four types of premixer are examined. The design of the premixer is determined by the combination of swirlers and mixing tubes. There are two variations of triple-concentric swirlers and three variations of mixing tubes. Comparisons are made among mean velocity distributions derived from CFD and PIV. PDF analysis is performed on the data from PIV to discuss the possibility of the occurrence of flashback. Combustion rig tests have been carried out also on similar condition to see combustion instabilities depending on the choice of premixers and operating conditions. Flame is directly observed from crystal windows placed on the side and downstream of the combustion chamber. A glass rod is installed on the wall of the mixing tube so as to see light emissions inside the tube, i.e. evidence of flashback. Pressure fluctuations at the combustor liner are measured in one position. The spectra of pressure fluctuations are computed to look at the possibility of combustion oscillations. Discussions are made on the relation between the global flame structure and pressure modes. Finally, proper premixer configurations to prevent combustion instabilities are proposed.

AB  - The rheological behavior of six different commercial brands of Mexican sauces was studied. The sauces were considered to be homogeneous with fine particles ("Barbecue", "Chipotle" and "Valentina") and heterogeneous with coarse particles ("Taquera", "Ranchera" and "Verde Bufalo"). The conventional concentric cylinders geometry was used to validate the non -conventional vane-in-cup system. Two containers were tested for the vane-in-cup; a small cup (cup/bob radius ratio = 1.06) and a large cup (cup/bob radius ratio = 2). Rheological parameters were calculated using the Couette-Searle analogy, considering a non-Newtonian behavior and a large cup. The large cup contained eight baffles to avoid slippage at the wall. Homogeneous sauces with fine particles were examined in all fixtures, while the heterogeneous containing coarse particles, only in the vane-in-large cup. All sauces exhibited a shear-thinning behavior that could be correlated by the power-law model. Several shear stress and shear rate factors proposed in the literature for large gaps and power-law models were compared to the average shear factors proposed in this study. The method proposed here was proved to be an alternative to characterize the flow properties of coarse particles suspensions in a vane-in-a-large cup rheometer. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim. Delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) often results from unaccustomed exercise or exercise that involves heavy eccentric loading of skeletal muscle. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and has been used widely in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Based on these findings, the investigators sought to determine whether CS supplementation might reduce DOMS symptoms associated with eccentric arm exercise.
   Methods. Sixteen non-resistance-trained males participated ill a double-blind protocol. Subjects consumed 3600 mg(.)day(-1) of encapsulated CS or placebo for 14 days preceding the exercise protocol and during 48 hours of follow-up measurements. Subjects performed a maximum of 50 eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors against a resistance that was 120% of the concentric one-repetition maximum.
   Results. Significant time effects were present for soreness, relaxed elbow extension (joint angle), and creatine kinase; all measures were significantly altered 48 hours after the exercise session. No effects were present for complement system fragment C3a and prostaglandin E-2. No significant treatment or interaction effects were detected for any of the variables.
   Conclusion. CS supplementation was not found to be effective in the prevention of DOMS, nor did it influence biochemical indices of inflammation and muscle damage following heavy eccentric loading of the arm flexors.

AB  - Economic segregation, or residential inequalities based on income, is a complex spatial process. It is associated with structures which arise at certain scales and which evolve in time. In this paper, we analyse the evolution of economic segregation in Montreal from 1980 to 2000. This analysis is based on household's income and on their distribution within the residential space from four scales: households, census tracts, municipalities and some radio-concentric zones. Results confirm that the spatial organisation of economic segregation is scale dependent. More precisely, local inequalities are growing more rapidly but this trend does not prevent the consolidation of metropolitan-sized clusters. Moreover, results confirm that Montreal's economic segregation follows North American trends like the growth of economic disparities (spatial or not) or the fact that the enrichment of central and ex-urban neighbourhoods is compensated by the impoverishment of inner-ring suburbs.

AB  - Acute epiploic appendagitis most commonly manifests with acute lower quadrant pain. Its clinical features are similar to those of acute diverticulitis or, less commonly, acute appendicitis. The conditions that may mimic acute epiploic appendagitis at computed tomography ( CT) include acute omental infarction, mesenteric panniculitis, fat-containing tumor, and primary and secondary acute inflammatory processes in the large bowel ( eg, diverticulitis and appendicitis). Whereas the location of acute epiploic appendagitis is most commonly adjacent to the sigmoid colon, acute omental infarction is typically located in the right lower quadrant and often is mistaken for acute appendicitis. It is important to correctly diagnose acute epiploic appendagitis and acute omental infarction on CT images because these conditions may be mistaken for acute abdomen, and the mistake may lead to unnecessary surgery. The CT features of acute epiploic appendagitis include an oval lesion 1.5 - 3.5 cm in diameter, with attenuation similar to that of fat and with surrounding inflammatory changes, that abuts the anterior sigmoid colon wall. The CT features of acute omental infarction include a well-circumscribed triangular or oval heterogeneous fatty mass with a whorled pattern of concentric linear fat stranding between the anterior abdominal wall and the transverse or ascending colon. As CT increasingly is used for the evaluation of acute abdomen, radiologists are likely to see acute epiploic appendagitis and its mimics more often. Recognition of these conditions on CT images will allow appropriate management of acute abdominal pain and may help to prevent unnecessary surgery.

AB  - Sarcomerogenesis, or the addition of sarcomeres in series within a fiber, has a profound impact on the performance of a muscle by increasing its contractile velocity and power. Sarcomerogenesis may provide a beneficial adaptation to prevent injury when a muscle consistently works at long lengths, accounting for the repeated-bout effect. The association between eccentric exercise, sarcomerogenesis and the repeated-bout effect has been proposed to depend on damage, where regeneration allows sarcomeres to work at shorter lengths for a given muscle-tendon unit length. To gain additional insight into this phenomenon, we measured fiber dynamics directly in the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of rats during uphill and downhill walking, and we measured serial sarcomere number in the VL and vastus intermedius (VI) after chronic training on either a decline or incline grade. We found that the knee extensor muscles of uphill walking rats undergo repeated active concentric contractions, and therefore they suffer no contraction-induced injury. Conversely, the knee extensor muscles during downhill walking undergo repeated active eccentric contractions. Serial sarcomere numbers change differently for the uphill and downhill exercise groups, and for the VL and VI muscles. Short muscle lengths for uphill concentric-biased contractions result in a loss of serial sarcomeres, and long muscle lengths for downhill eccentric-biased contractions result in a gain of serial sarcomeres.

AB  - Background: Spike effectiveness represents a determining element in volleyball. To compete at a high level, the player must, in particular, produce a spike characterized by a high ball velocity.
   Hypothesis: Some muscular and physical features could influence ball velocity during the volleyball spike.
   Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study.
   Methods: A total of 19 male volleyball players from the 2 highest Belgian national divisions underwent an isokinetic assessment of the dominant shoulder and elbow. Ball velocity performance (radar gun) during a spike test, morphological feature, and jump capacity (ergo jump) of the player were measured. We tested the relationship between the isokinetic parameters or physical features and field performances represented by spike velocity. We also compared first-division and second-division player data.
   Results: Spike velocity correlated significantly with strength performance of the dominant shoulder (internal rotators) and of the dominant elbow (flexors and extensors) in the concentric mode. Negative correlations were established with the concentric external rotator on internal rotator ratio at 400 deg/s and with the mixed ratio (external rotator at 60 deg/s in the eccentric mode on internal rotator at 240 deg/s in the concentric mode). Positive correlations appeared with both the volleyball players' jump capacity and body mass index. First-division players differed from second-division players by higher ball velocity and increased jump capacity.
   Conclusion: Some specific strength and physical characteristics correlated significantly with spike performance in high-level volleyball practice.
   Clinical Relevance: Our results could provide useful information for training management and propose some reflections on injury prevention.

AB  - The late Albian (Early Cretaceous) lineage of Actinoceramus sulcatus (Parkinson 1819) is a remarkable example of macro- and microevolution within the Bivalvia. Immediately following cladogenesis from ancestral A. concentricus, the lineage displays a conspicuous, short-term excursion through morphospace followed by a return to the ancestral form. This excursion is marked by the acquisition, and subsequent loss, of large radial folds affecting some part or all of the shell. The pattern is noteworthy because of the gross scale and rate of morphological evolution, the relatively short life span of an "extreme" morphology, an apparent evolutionary reversal, the presence of phenotypic clines through time, the extent of phenotypic variation within populations and abundance of morphological intermediates between disparate end-member types, the wide geographic distributions of phenotypic clines and variants, and the subtle asymmetry of morphological transitions bounding the evolutionary excursion.
   From census and biometric analyses of stratigraphically constrained samples, we conclude that morphological change was not focused at speciation and the pattern of evolution does not conform to the classical paradigm of punctuated equilibrium. Instead, we infer that observed patterns are best explained by phyletic evolution, at widely varying rates, combined with ecophenotypic plasticity. Evolution targeted the potential to form radial folds; the expression of those in any individual was determined, in part at least, by environmental cues. Ecophenotypic plasticity in A. sulcatus was itself probably an evolutionary response favored by the presence of long-lived planktotrophic larvae and wide dispersal of the species. In A. sulcatus, there is a continuum of pattern between intrapopulational, ecophenotypic variation that can be observed on bedding planes, interregional variation, and phyletic change through time. We argue that this continuity of pattern is most easily explained by continuity of process: in the case of the visually striking radial folds in A. sulcatus, there is no reason to invoke distinct hierarchies of macro- and microevolution; instead, these seem to be parts of a continuum.

AB  - An increasing use of forest sampling and a huge progress in individual-tree growth modelling offered a new field of application for individual-tree growth models: predicting forest growth by updating tree data of individual sample plots. What is usually overlooked by such applications is the fact that the sampling design for collecting the parameterization data of the model, in particular plot size, has an effect on specific model coefficients. Therefore, biased predictions will be obtained if a different sampling design is use for collecting data that should be used for growth predictions (JAAKKOLA, 1967; STAGE and WYKOFF, 1998; HYNYNEN and OJAN-SUU, 2003). HANN and ZUMRAWI (1991) showed that this bias plays only a subordinated role for a single-period growth prediction. However, they pointed out that it is unknown how this error will propagate, but they expected an accumulation in case of long term projections.
   In this study we tested this hypothesis by means of two stimulation examples using the distance-independent individual-tree growth simulator PROGNAUS (MONSERUD and STERBA, 1996, 1999). Data came from a 20 year old stand of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). We performed one simulation run for the entire stand (1 ha), and one for 9 angle-count sample plots that were also located within this stand. The analyses of the simulation runs revealed that primarily the competition variable BAL (Basal-Area-in-Larger Trees: WYKOFF, 1990) is responsible for the biased predictions. The reason is that plot size is fixed at the start of the simulation runs, but tree size and spacing change during the span of simulated stand development (STAGE and WYKOFF, 1998). Oil small sample plots this leads to an increasing disproportion between tree dimensions and plot size that causes ail excessive deviation from the original sampling design and affects the BAL variable in favor of the thickest trees on the sample plots (Tab. I and Fig. 1). Because BAL is the only competition variable in the mortality function of PROGNAUS (MONSERUD and STERBA, 1999), the thickest trees of the plots (their BAL equal 0) have reduced mortality rates, therefore increasing the competition pressure on the smaller trees. The result of this phenomenon is that all the smaller trees die, and only the thickest trees on the plots survive. Moreover, their represented tree numbers per hectare are too high because of the reduced mortality rates. This leads in the long run to a biased prediction of the basal area development. Also the DBH distribution at the end of the simulation period is biased (Fig. 2).
   In order to prevent the shift of the BAL variable in favor of the thickest trees LEDERMANN and ECKULLNER (2004) presented the tree record splitting method to attain uniform resolution of this competition variable. The BAL resolution is defined as the differences in BAL of neighbouring trees in the DBH distribution. Applying the splitting method to angle-count sampling data, a tree record is divided into two identical tree records, each representing 50% of the original tree number per hectare. At the end of the splitting procedure the BAL of every tree record is updated (Tab. 2). In case of splitting the thickest tree record, only 50% of its original tree number still have a BAL of 0 while the other 50%, represented by the new tree record, have a BAL > 0. This yields a higher mortality rate and a reduced diameter increment of the new tree record, finally resulting in an unbiased prediction of the basal area development, and showing a realistic DBH distribution (Fig. 4).
   When the splitting procedure needs to be applied depends on the inventory design that was used for sampling the parameterization data of a simulator's sub-models. If these data came from angle-count samples, then a tree record needs to be split when its represented basal area per hectare equals or exceeds 4/3 of the basal area factor k used for data sampling. If the parameterization data came front concentric circles that were combined with different mini-mum diameters for data recording, then it needs to be checked at the end of each prediction cycle whether a tree exceeded the next larger minimum diameter. For example, if a tree's DBH is 9 cm and this tree is recorded oil a plot with 2.5 m radius (Tab. 3), then its represented tree number per hectare is 509.3. If the DBH of this tree exceeds 10 cm during the next growing period, then the tree would be recorded on a plot with 5 m radius, and its represented tree number per hectare would be 127.3. However, due to the fact that the new plot size is four times the old plot size, three additional tree records are needed, and the original tree number of 509.3 needs to be equally distributed to four (1 old + 3 new) tree records.
   The results of this study also show that the bias of the simulated basal area increases as the length of the simulation period increases (Fig. 2). Hence, one could argue whether a simulation period of 150 years is justified since there are so many unpredictable things that could happen. This argument is basically true, but there are some specific applications where long-term prognoses are needed (e.g. scenario analyses in order to evaluate the effect of a changing management strategy). Moreover. in many yield tables the length of the growing (prediction) period is also more than 100 years.
   In general, the results Of this study indicate that tree record splitting is ail appropriate method to prevent a deviation from the original sampling design of the parameterization data (Figs. 1 and 3). Therefore, it allows for a differentiation with regard to tree size (DBH), making the simulation results of an existing model more realistic.

AB  - Delayed-onset muscle soreness refers to the skeletal muscle pain that is experienced following eccentric exercise. The aim of the present study was to examine the physiological effects of physical activity with or without ibuprofen on delayed onset muscle soreness. Forty-four non-athletic male volunteers (age 24.3 +/- 2.4 years) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: physical activity (n = 11), ibuprofen (n = 11), physical activity and ibuprofen (combination, n = 11), or control (n = 11). The physical activity programme comprised 5 min of walking and jogging, 10 min of static stretching of the hands and shoulder girdle, and 5 min of concentric movements with sub-maximal contractions. The total amount of ibuprofen consumed by a single individual was 2800 mg; this was taken from 1 h before the eccentric actions up to 48 h after it. Delayed onset muscle soreness was induced by performing 70 eccentric contractions of the biceps muscle of the non-dominant side on a modified arm curl machine. Perceived muscle soreness, maximal eccentric contraction, creatine kinase enzyme activity and elbow range of motion were assessed 1 h before and 1, 24 and 48 h after the eccentric actions. The results indicated that, after the eccentric actions, soreness increased (P < 0.001) across time in all groups, with the highest values being recorded at 24 h. At 24 and 48 h, greater soreness (P < 0.001) was observed in the control group than in the physical activity and combination groups. After the eccentric actions, creatine kinase increased and was elevated (P < 0.001) compared with baseline in all groups, with values returning to baseline in the physical activity and combination groups by 48 h. However, creatine kinase in the control and ibuprofen groups was still significantly higher than at baseline after 48 h. Creatine kinase was higher (P < 0.001) in the control group than in physical activity and combination groups at 24 and 48 h. There was also a reduction (P < 0.001) in elbow range of motion across time. This reduction in elbow range of motion was greater (P < 0.001) in the control and ibuprofen groups than in the physical activity and combination groups at 1, 24 and 48 h. The reduction in maximum eccentric contraction was greater (P < 0.001) in the control and ibuprofen groups than in the physical activity group at 24 and 48 h and the combination group at 48 h. In conclusion, the results add to our understanding of the effects of physical activity and the combination of physical activity and ibuprofen in reducing the severity of muscle soreness induced by eccentric exercise. Physical activity conducted before eccentric exercise alleviates muscle soreness. Our results indicate that physical activity with or without ibuprofen helps to prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major factor limiting long-term survival after cardiac transplantation. CAV is an accelerated form of coronary artery disease ( CAD) that is characterized by concentric fibrous intimal hyperplasia along the length of coronary vessels. Both immunologic and nonimmunologic risk factors contribute to the development of CAV by causing endothelial dysfunction and injury eventually leading to progressive intimal thickening. The diagnosis of CAV remains a challenge as angiography, the standard method for detecting focal plaques, lacks sensitivity in detecting CAV, and intravascular ultrasonography, a more sensitive method, lacks the ability to evaluate the entire coronary tree. The disease is difficult to treat and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Since treatment of CAV is limited and usually involves repeat transplantation, prevention or mitigation of immunologic and nonimmunologic risk factors is critically important. CAV prevention may involve therapy that provides protection against endothelial injury implemented just before transplantation, during storage and transplantation as well as after transplantation. This review addresses the frequency of occurrence, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of CAV, highlighting areas of active research.

AB  - Background. Although shoulder arthroplasty is an accepted treatment for osteoarthritis, loosening of the glenoid component, which mainly occurs at the bone-cement interface, remains a major concern. Presently, the mechanical effect of the cement mantel thickness on the bone-cement interface is still unclear.
   Methods. Finite element analysis of a prosthetic scapula was used to evaluate the effect of cement thickness on stresses and micromotions at the bone-cement interface. The glenoid component was all-polyethylene, keeled and flat back. Cement mantel thickness was gradually increased from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. Two glenohumeral contact forces were applied: concentric and eccentric. Two extreme cases were considered for the bone-cement interface: bonded and debonded.
   Findings. Within cement, stress increased as cement thickness decreased, reaching the fatigue limit below 1.0 mm. Bone stress was below its ultimate strength and was minimum between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. Interface stress was close to the interface strength, and also minimum between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. Both the decentring of the load and the debonding of the interface increased the stress.
   Interpretation. A cement thinning weakens the cement, but also the bone-cement interface, along the back-keel edges. Conversely, a cement thickening rigidifies the cemented implant, consequently increasing interfacial stresses and micromotions. To avoid both excessive cement fatigue and interface failure, an ideal cement thickness has been identified between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A pneumatic gun for ballistic delivery of microparticles to soft targets is proposed and demonstrated. The particles are accelerated by a high-speed flow of helium in a capillary tube. Vacuum suction applied to a concentric larger diameter tube is used to divert substantially all of the flow of helium from the gun nozzle, thereby preventing the gas from hitting and damaging the target. Speed of ejection of micron-sized gold particles from the gun nozzle, and their depth of penetration into agarose gels are reported. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Given that they represent the most economical option for disposing of refuse, waste landfills are widespread in urban areas. However, landfills generate air and water pollution and require restoration for landscape development. A number of unsanitary waste landfills have caused severe environmental problems in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the colonization status of different tree species on waste landfills to assess their potential for restoring unsanitary landfills in South Korea. Plot surveys were conducted using 10 x 10-m quadrats at seven waste landfill sites: Bunsuri, Dugiri, Hasanundong, Gomaeri, Kyongseodong, Mojeonri, and Shindaedong. We determined the height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and number of tree species in the plots, and enumerated all saplings ! 1 m high. Because black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia, was the dominant tree species in the waste landfills, we measured the distance from the presumed mother plant (i.e., the tallest black locust in a patch), height, and DBH of all individuals in black locust patches to determine patch structure. Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix koreensis, and Populus sieboldii formed canopy layers in the waste landfills. The basal area of black locust was 1.51 m(2)/ha, and this species had the highest number of saplings among all tree species. The diameter of the black locust patches ranged from 3.71 to 11.29 m. As the patch diameter increased, the number of regenerated saplings also tended to increase, albeit not significantly. Black locust invaded via bud banks and spread clonally in a concentric pattern across the landfills. This species grew well in the dry habitat of the landfills, and its growth rate was very high. Furthermore, black locust has the ability to fix nitrogen symbiotically; it is therefore considered a well-adapted species for waste landfills. Eleven woody species were selected for screening: Acer palmatum, Albizzia julibrissin, Buxus microphylla var. koreana, Ginkgo biloba, Hibiscus syriacus, Koelreuteria paniculata, Ligustrum obtusifolium, Liriodendron tulipifera, Pinus koraiensis, Pinus thunbergii, and Sophora japonica. As a result of a comparison of the total ratio (sum of shoot extension and diameter growth at the landfill relative to a reference site) and mortality, six species (Liriodendron tulipifera, Albizzia julibrissin, Ligustrum obtusifolium, Buxus microphylla var. koreana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Sophora japonica), which had a total ratio > 1 and experienced low mortality, are recommended as potentially suitable species for waste landfill remediation. We suggest that mixed plantations of ubiquitous adaptable species and naturally occurring black locust will enhance the landscape through synergistic effects.

AB  - A new method for the speciation analysis of selenite (Se-IV), selenate (Se-VI), and selenocyanate (SeCN-) is described and first results are presented on the distribution of these species in wastewater samples from a Brazilian oil refinery plant. The method is based on the ion chromatographic separation of these species followed by on-line detection of 77 Se, 78 Se, and 82 Se using quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The system employed consisted of a HPLC pump equipped with a manual syringe loading injector, and an anion exchange column (Metrosep A Supp1), the latter interfaced with the ICPMS via a concentric nebulizer-cyclonic spray chamber sample introduction device. Several eluents already described in the literature for the speciation analysis of inorganic selenium were tested, permitting in most cases a good separation of Se(W) and Se(VI), however, resulting all in very long residence times (> 30 min) and associated peak broadening for the SeCN- ion. This drawback could be effectively avoided by using as the mobile phase a solution of cyanuric acid (3 mmol L-1), modified with acetonitrile (2% v/v) and percchlorate acid (2.5 mmol L-1). Typical retention times (s) for the three analyte species were: selenite (210) < selenate (250) < selenocyanate (450). Repeatabilities in peak position were better than 1% and in peak area evaluation about 3%. Absolute limits of detection (in ng) for these species using an ELAN 5000 instrument and a 500-mu L sample injection loop are 0.04, 0.05 and 0.09, respectively. No certified reference materials were available for this study, however, results on spiked wastewater samples showed acceptable recoveries (80-110%) and repeatabilities (RSD < 5%), thus validating this method for its intended purpose. Once optimized, the method was applied to wastewater samples from an oil refinery plant. In all samples until now analyzed, selenocyanate was by far the most abundant selenium species reaching concentrations of up to 90 mu g L-1. Selenite was detected only in one sample and selenate could not identified in any of the samples analyzed. Total concentrations of selenium in most samples, assessed by hydride generation ICPMS and by solution nebulization inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES), exceeded those obtained from speciation analysis, indicating the presence of other selenium species not observed by the here used methodology.

AB  - The on-going mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached historic proportions. There is an operational need for efficient and cost-effective methods to identify red attack trees in these areas. In this paper, we examine the use of an unsupervised clustering 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery for the detection of mountain pine beetle red attack at sites with low and medium levels of attack. Independent validation data were collected from aerial photography and were used to determine the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery. Concentric buffers, in 1-m increments to a maximum of 4 in, were applied to red attack pixels to characterize attribute accuracy as a function of positional accuracy. When a one-pixel buffer (4 in) is applied, the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery was 71% (low attack) and 92% (medium attack). Analysis of red attack trees that were omitted in the analysis of the multispectral IKONOS image indicated that detection of red attack was most effective for larger tree crowns (diameter > 1.5 in) that were less than I I in from other red attack trees. These results demonstrate that the unsupervised classification of mountain pine beetle red attack using multispectral IKONOS imagery is an operationally viable approach.

AB  - Objectives: Although previous research shows that the hamstring length-tension relationship during eccentric contractions plays a role in hamstring injury, training methods to promote beneficial adaptations are still unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether an eccentric hamstring specific training programme results in favourable adaptations.
   Design: Eccentric training consisting of the Nordic hamstring exercise performed twice a week for four weeks. Pre- and post-training concentric/concentric isokinetic testing of peak torque (PT) and position of peak torque (POS) was performed for both the quadriceps and hamstrings of both legs at 60 degrees s(-1). Vertical jump height was also assessed.
   Participants: Nine athletic, male subjects with no previous strength training experience.
   Results: There was a significant increase in vertical jump height (pre = 51.0 +/- 4.8 cm, post = 54.4 +/- 6.3 cm, p = 0.04), a significant reduction in quadriceps PT (pre = 204.6 +/- 21.9 N.m., post = 181.5 +/- 19.9 N.m., p = 0.01), a significant decrease in hamstring POS from full knee extension (pre = 32.5 +/- 7.4 degrees, post = 26.2 +/- 8.6 degrees, p = 0.01) and a significant hamstring POS difference between limbs (dominant = 33.8 +/- 9.5 degrees, non-dominant = 24.9 +/- 6.5 degrees, p = 0.01).
   Conclusion: Nordic hamstring exercise training may produce favourable neuromuscular adaptations for the possible prevention of hamstring injuries while enhancing performance in athletic, untrained males. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wild bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) were studied in southern India to assess their ability to discriminate non-venomous, venomous and predatory snakes. Realistic snake models were presented to eight troops of bonnet macaques at feeding stations and their behavior was video-recorded 3 min before and 3 min after snake exposure. Snakes presented were: (1) venomous Indian cobra (Naja naja) displaying an open hood with 'eyespots'; (2) venomous common Indian krait (Bungarus caeruleus); (3) non-venomous green keelback (Macropisthodan plumbicolor); (4) non-venomous rat snake (Ptyas mucosus); and (5) Indian python (Python molurus) which preys on macaques. Latencies to detect and react to the snakes were evaluated to determine initial responsiveness. Longer-term assessment was measured as the percentage of time individuals looked at the snakes and monitored the activity of nearby individuals before and after snake detection. All snake models engendered caution and maintenance of a safe distance. Alarm calling occurred only during python presentations. The cobra engendered a startle response or running in the largest percentage of individuals after its detection, whereas the rat snake and python elicited bipedal standing or ambulating to monitor the snakes. We also examined the influence of age on snake recognition. Juveniles and subadults looked at the cobra, krait, and python for a larger percentage of time than adults did; albeit, adults looked at the python substantially longer than at the other snakes. Age differences in behavior suggest that, with the exception of the python, repeated experience with snakes in the wild moderates excitability, consistent with the likely threat of envenomation.

AB  - The topologically segregated bilayer-bead concept has been applied to encoded "one-bead one-compound" (OBOC) combinatorial libraries to avoid the interference of coding tags with biological screening. In this paper, we report on the development of a novel partial Alloc-deprotection (PAD) approach and the use of this approach to establish a new ladder-synthesis method for OBOC combinatorial libraries to further exploit the concept. In the PAD approach, Alloc-protected beads are partially deprotected, sequentially layer by layer, starting from the outer layer toward the bead interior. The degree of deprotection (or thickness of each layer) is controlled by the time of exposure to the deprotecting agent, palladium. By repetitive use of the PAD approach, a small portion of Alloc-protected N termini in the bead interior is liberated in each synthetic cycle for generation of an additional ladder member such that each library bead will carry a full-length library compound on the bead surface and a series of truncated ladder members in the bead interior. For the libraries containing isobaric residues, a simple encoding strategy is introduced in the ladder-synthesis method so that the isobaric residues can be differentiated by the coding tags. One advantage of this encoding strategy is that the coding tags are confined together with the truncated ladder members in the bead interior, thus maintaining the arrangement that only the library compounds are displayed on the bead surface. The PAD approach of forming multiple concentric functional layers inside a bead is simple, reliable, and may have other applications in addition to OBOC combinatorial library bead encoding, such as the development of novel optically encoded beads for multiplex immunodiagnostics or even information recording.

AB  - In an evolutionary prospective, it is possible that female mice have a differential perception of novel events than male mice and use a different behavioural strategy for risk assessment. However, female mice are less studied than male mice in behavioural tests of emotional reactivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate how wild-derived female house mice differ from domesticated female mice in their risk assessment strategy. A total of 46 adult female mice, 14 BALB/c, 16 C57BL/6 and 14 Wild mice were tested in the Concentric Square Field (CSF), Open Field (OF) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) at three consecutive days. Parameters from all three tests were categorized according to their relevance to activity, exploration, approach-avoidance and use of open areas-shelter. Principal Component Analysis (PCA-SIMCA) of the animals' behaviour in the CSF arena was performed both for females alone and in comparison with earlier findings in male mice under the same test conditions.
   The results clearly show that female wild mice had a higher avoidance of open areas than the laboratory strains. There was also a trend indicating differences in exploration and approach-avoidance between female Wild and the laboratory strains. The multivariate test, CSF, was able to detect differences between Wild and laboratory strains in three (exploration, approach-avoidance, open-shelter) of the four functional categories measured. Wild female mice also had a higher frequency of rearing and grooming and a lower duration in the corridors in the CSF. Clear strain differences were found between BALB and C57BL in all tests where BALB generally had higher risk assessment and lower risk taking than C57BL. No general sex differences were found, however the sex differences were greater in Wild mice compared to the laboratory strains. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An emended interpretation is offered of the gross xylem structure and development of the haustorium of Psittacanthus ramiflorus (DC.) G. Don (Loranthaceae) and the woodrose induced on its hosts, based on decorticated material. At the point of entry, the host cambium is split or perhaps locally destroyed but regenerates, eventually in an inverted position, with its initials apparently assuming a position perpendicular to the mother branch. The resultant cambial 'front' is apparently strongly stimulated in some areas while nearly inactive in others, resulting in a basketlike structure of branching and anastomosing arms of xylem which eventually fuse completely. The parasite develops successive, concentric layers of xylem strands which connect perpendicularly to the inner margin of the woodrose. These xylem strands fuse upwardly, merging into tongue-like layers of normal xylem applied to older xylem. Brief reference is made to variation of woodroses in other species of Psittacanthus and to the latter's xylem connection to a hyperparasitic Phoradendron (Viscaceae).

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease affecting approximately I million adults worldwide. Relapses and progression are the two basic clinical phenomena of prototypic MS. Relapses are the clinical expression of acute focal or multifocal inflammatory demyelination disseminated in the central nervous system, whereas progression reflects the occurrence of chronic demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis. Early in the disease, remission of symptoms likely is the result of remyelination and resolution of inflammation, but after recurrent attacks, remyelination is limited. Inflammatory and noninflammatory factors likely contribute to short- and long-term disability in MS. This review highlights recent advances in experimental neuropathology that have contributed to a better understanding of MS lesion pathogenesis.

AB  - A methodology is presented for optimization of the dynamic response of concentrically braced steel frames subjected to seismic excitation, based on the concept of uniform distribution of deformation. In order to obtain the optimum distribution of structural properties, an iterative optimization procedure has been adopted. In this approach, the structural properties are modified so that inefficient material is gradually shifted from strong to weak areas of a structure. This process is continued until a state of uniform deformation is achieved. It is shown that the seismic performance of such a structure is optimal, and behaves generally better than those designed by conventional methods. In order to avoid onerous analysis of the frame models, an equivalent procedure is introduced for performing the optimization procedure on the modified reduced shear-building model of the frames, which is shown to be accurate enough for design purposes.

AB  - Three categories of fossil aggregates are recognized in the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale biota from SW China: (1) elliptical aggregates with randomly distributed exoskeletal remains of typically small- to medium-size bivalved arthropods (e.g, ostracode-like bradoriids, phyllocarid-like waptiids), hyoliths, and trilobites are interpreted as coprolites, possibly produced by anomalocaridids (e.g., waptiid-rich coprolites) and/or unknown epibenthic predators; (2) elongate, ribbon-like aggregates composed of oriented small hyolith shells, interpreted as the feces of infaunal carnivorous worms such as priapulids; and (3) concentric aggregates, typically with a central nucleus (e.g, remains of medusoid eldoniids or bivalved arthropod carapaces) and peripheral exoskeletal fragments, possibly generated by bottom currents whirling around carcasses. These new coprolite data add to morphofunctional information obtained from fossil organisms and indicate that predation occurred at different levels of the water column with: (1) endobenthic predators (diverse priapulid fauna) feeding near the sediment-water interface; (2) epibenthic predators / scavengers (almost exclusively arthropods); (3) predators living in the lower levels of the water column (e.g., anomalocaridids); and (4) mid-water predators exploiting upper levels in the water column (e.g, eldoniids, ctenophores, chaetognaths). Communities living at or close to the water-sediment interface (epibenthic sensu stricto, meiobenthic, and demersal animals) were exposed to a multidirectional predatorial pressure from infaunal, epifaunal, and mid-water predators. Although predation was diverse, nothing indicates that the food chain extended beyond the level of primary carnivores. Animals already had acquired complex behaviors such as hunting (e.g., anomalocaridids, priapulids) and predator avoidance in which sensory systems were involved. The example of the Maotianshan Shale indicates that the burst of anatomical innovations (new body plans) that characterizes the early Cambrian also was accompanied by the rapid development of new feeding strategies and by an unprecedented expansion of ecological interactions (prey-predator relationships).

AB  - Sex ratios of the American snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina are female-biased at cool temperatures. male-biased at moderate temperatures, and only females are produced at warm temperatures. The laboratory incubation of eggs at several constant temperatures yields patterns of skewed sex ratios. In this study.. incubated eggs represented regional samples of C. serpentina from six different latitudes. The sample from the highest latitude yielded male-biased sex ratios across the broadest range of cool temperatures. This male-biased zone and those of die other five samples collectively contributed to a nested arrangement that is approximately symmetrical around a temperature of 24.5degreesC. Two indices of ternperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) patterns (MF pivotal temperature. width of the male-biased zone) were significantly associated with latitude and with published data on several climatic variables (e.g. sunshine and rainfall). At high latitudes, females nest in exposed locations, locally the warmest places. At low latitudes females place their nests in shaded locations. Such nest site selection renders, high latitude nests warmer than low latitude nests, even if only intermittently Given that constant conditions show, faster ernbryogenesis in high vs low latitude eggs, exposed nest sites seem to be an additional adaptation to hasten embryogenesis in high latitude nests. At low latitudes, shading prevents nests front overheating. We propose that a trade-off between evolution, (1) to balance sex ratio and (2) to maintain male-biased sex ratios in a temperature ran-e that favours male fitness, leads to the observed arrangement of concentric TSD patterns centred around male production at 24.5degreesC.

AB  - This study compared the strength and endurance of shoulder internal rotators (IR) and external rotators (ER) among baseball pitchers of four age levels. Eighty baseball pitchers aged 10-23 years participated this study. Strength was assessed by the average peak torque of the middle 3 out of 5 repetitions. Endurance was assessed by thirty concentric internal and external contractions. Percentage of strength loss, initial and final torque ratio were used to assess endurance ability. The results showed that IR strength was greater than the ERs for all groups. The ERAR ratio ranged 0.71-0.77. In endurance assessment, the players were found to have 70% strength loss in the IRs. Adolescent and pre-pubescent players had larger (p < 0.05) strength loss in the ERs. Compared with adult pitchers, adolescent and pre-pubescent baseball pitchers had relatively weaker shoulder ERs especially after high repetition muscle contraction. In order to prevent shoulder injury in adolescent and pre-adolescent baseball throwers, muscle endurance in ER should be emphasized.

AB  - Object detection is a critical step of many image recognition systems. In this paper, we discussed the circular shape object detection problem in still color images. The proposed method has an important feature of integrating color image edge extraction result with a novel circle parameter determination algorithm efficiently. First, an accurate isotropic edge detector is introduced to extract color image edge and calculate precise gradient direction of each potential edge pixel, which assures the high accuracy of subsequent circle detection. Then the detected potential edge results are verified by integrating them with spatial information and the result of region based analysis. Second we utilize just only one 2-dimensional accumulator array and one 1-dimensional accumulator array, which greatly reduce storage requirement and time complexity, to detect circles of any radius. Furthermore, the validity of detected potential circle centers is checked to avoid detecting false circles. Experimental results show that our method is robust and effective in locating objects with complete or incomplete or concentric circle boundary in real color images without any prior knowledge.

AB  - Thin layers of GaN have been deposited on 1 pm thick MOVPE GaN(0001) thin film substrates using a novel vertical iodine vapor phase epitaxy system. The system features three concentric flow zones that separate the reactant gasses until they reach the substrate. Hydrogen flows through the innermost zone to deliver iodine vapor from an external bubbler to the molten Ga maintained at similar to 1050 degrees C and Gal to the substrate; high-purity ammonia flows through the outermost zone; nitrogen flows through the middle zone to prevent reaction between the growth species at the Gal nozzle. GaN growth was found to be a function of time, with decreasing concentration of iodine the likely cause of a decrease in growth rate at longer growth times. The step-and-terrace microstructure of the MOVPE seeds was replaced with a smooth morphology film after the shortest growth experiment. Star-shaped features with hexagonal symmetry grew on the surface with increasing growth time. These features became the tops of hexagonal pyramids; these pyramids grew competitively and dominated the final growth surface. The surface of the films grown for the longest period contained a step-and-terrace microstructure; however, the density of steps of was lower than that on the surface of underlying MOVPE substrate.

Growth rates greater than 75 mu m/hr have been achieved at a V/III ratio of 75. The use of higher V/III ratios resulted in lower growth rates. Optical microscopy of the final growth surfaces revealed spiral hillocks with base diameters as large as 1mm. Increased Ga in the vapor phase resulted in a duplex microstructure containing both hillocks; and faceted, oriented crystals overgrowing the hillocks. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The deformational history and morpho-structural evolution of Monte Vulture, a Pleistocene composite volcano located on the eastern margin of southern Apennines, have been outlined by integrating information from regional and local tectonics, geomorphology, kinematics of fault population, fracture pattern analysis, multivariate statistics of chemical data, and a revised stratigraphy of the volcanic units.
   Monte Vulture is a strato-volcano composed of highly undersaturated alkaline-potassic to ultrapotassic rocks belonging to the Roman Magmatic Province and ranging in age from 674+/-7 to 132+/-12 ka B.P.; it is a relatively small volcanic complex which consists of a 700 m thick lava and pyroclastic succession and is characterised by a central vent and parasitic cones, eccentric lava-plugs, and domes. The earlier volcanic morphology has been modified by summit and lateral volcano-tectonic collapses. The volcano is localised on a structural high of the pre-Pliocene and Pliocene sedimentary bedrock. Its activity developed in middle Pleistocene times, starting at about 0.73 Ma and ending at 0.13 Ma. Therefore, genesis and evolution Of Mount Vulture Volcano took place during the recent deformation of the frontal (i.e. eastern) part of the south-Apennines chain.
   The arrangement of Monte Vulture deposits has been widely reviewed by grouping, into basic unconformity-bounded units (Synthems), the volcano-stratigraphic units which are not separated by unconformities or long quiescence periods marked by palaeosols and erosional surfaces. The major unconformity of the volcanic complex has been observed at the contact of the upper cooling units on the basal ignimbrites, suggesting that an important tectonic deformation occurred at the passage from early to middle Pleistocene.
   The geological backbone of the area has been reconstructed by means of a balanced cross-section. The interplay between volcanogenic deformation and tectonic evolution of the chain during the Quaternary have been investigated by analysing fault and fracture populations occurring in both volcanic units and sediments. The fracture system consists mainly of high-angle or sub-vertical planes which, for each sampling site, are generally grouped in two main orthogonal sets.
   The orientation of fault and fracture sets mirrors the arrangement of the morpho-lineaments and changes with respect to the centre of the volcano, thus showing a radial-concentric pattern typically associated with volcanic doming (i.e. pulse of magmatic chamber and consequent pre-eruptive ground deformation). Evidence of tectonic control on the deformation of the volcanic complex come from the presence in the volcanic units of N120 degrees+/-10 degrees-trending strike-slip faults, which represent a regional feature of the southern Apennines. The existence of a flower structure generated by N120 degrees left-lateral shear and sutured by a palaeosol in turn overlaid by a 484+/-8 ka B.P. unit indicates that the volcano underwent a NE-SW contraction even during the middle Pleistocene. NE-SW-directed extensional faulting caused NW-SE to N-S non-Andersonian conjugate systems affecting all the volcanic products, so testifying a change of tectonic regime.
   The tectonic evolution of the area also influenced the chemical variation of the volcanic products. Such a control has been revealed by reorganising and statistically analysing the large available chemical database according to the new tectono-stratigraphic picture of Monte Vulture. New data have also been produced and included in the dataset to fill the lack of information relative to one of the synthems (Valle dei Grigi-Fosso del Corbo Synthem). The complete database was used as an input matrix for multivariate statistical analysis using Principal Component Analysis technique (PCA) and single variation diagrams were also produced. To avoid problems arising from comparison of chemical data obtained by techniques with different precision (sensitivity and detection limits) only major and trace elements analyses obtained by XRF (X-ray Fluorescence) were taken in consideration. Rare Earth Elements and some incompatible elements such as Ta, Hf, Th, U, Sc as well as Cs were not included in the database because data regarding these elements were not available for all the synthemic units. The variation plots give evidence for remarkable geochemical differences between the cooling units not consistent with a unique fractionation trend. The basal ignimbrites form the Foggianello Synthem - with a tephrite-phonolite and trachyte-phonolite composition - do not represent the most fractionated products of the foidite-tephrite magmas that originated the units. Also the more recent products (Monticchio Synthem) do not follow a similar trend.
   The final multivariate analysis output showed that the chemical dataset group into three different ensembles which reflect changes in the deformational regime acting during Pleistocene times in the Monte Vulture area.
   Structural analysis and geomorphic survey showed that the present-day setting of the volcano and adjacent areas derived from the interplay between volcanogenic doming and regional tectonics. Data presented in this study allow the tectonic activity, expressed by the N120 degrees-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults, to be constrained, showing that in this area the deformational regime changed From transpressional to transtensional conditions during the middle Pleistocene. it can be concluded that three main morpho-tectonic stages with different fault kinematics affected the Quaternary volcanic deposits and the adjoining sedimentary successions. An important tectonic episode, generated in a contractional regime and associated with structural transfer with local NW-SE extension, pre-dates these stages. In this scenario, a set of N40-50 degrees-trending deep faults was generated. Such a system was responsible for the magma ascent, maybe inducing the formation of several magma chambers localised at different levels, as suggested by the chemical peculiarities of the Mount Vulture products. The transfer structure - here named Vulture Line - crosses the entire chain-foreland system and may be identified in the alignment of the Sele and Ofanto rivers mouths and was active both during the upper Pliocene - lower Pleistocene contractional regime and the middle-upper Pleistocene extensional stages. The deep projection of the Vulture Line traces the discontinuity of the subducting Apulian plate which rolls back with different flexural retreats. This inherited feature controlled the emplacement of the ignimbrites (Foggianello Synthem) and was repeatedly re-activated during the eruptive, deformational and morphological history of the volcano.

AB  - Midface rejuvenation surgery is most challenging. The margin of error for the lower lid is on the order of 0.5 mm, and the cosmetic result can sometimes look unnatural. A minimally invasive technique for malar and lower lid lift is proposed. Two incisions are used: the standard subciliary lower eyelid incision and one on the lateral part of the upper eyelid. Through these incisions a skin flap lower eyelid dissection and a subperiosteal malar dissection are performed. The arcus marginalis itself is not transected as is the case when the malar area is entered from the lower eyelid. Rather, a subperiosteral release of the arcus marginalis is performed through a muscle-splitting incision at the lateral canthus. Eyelid malposition is avoided because the muscles, vessels, and nerves converging toward the medial canthus are not interrupted. The subperiosteal dissection of the arcus marginalis extends to the medial canthus and also releases the insertion of the orbicularis oculi superior malar part. Consequently, all the attachments of the tear trough are released. Two subperiosteal suspensions connect the central part of the nasolabial volume and, more laterally, the central part of the malar area to the inferolateral orbital rim. The elevation of the malar volume resulting from these suspensions is concentric with the orbit. A final third suspension vertically connects the orbicularis oculi muscle with the underlying periosteum to the bone of the lateral orbital rim. Significant skin excess is removed from the lower eyelid. Complete disinsertion of the tear trough attachments combined with the malar elevation treats the entire palpebromalar groove. The lifted fat volume fills the space resulting from the subperiosteal disinsertion. A safer, more natural and more reliable result is achieved because the vectors of traction with this technique are exactly opposite those of the mid-face aging process, and because a very stable fixation is created between the lifted malar periosteum and the malar and latero-orbital rim bones.

AB  - The male germline stem cells (GSCs) of the milkweed bug present an extraordinary structural polarity that is, to our knowledge, unequalled by any other type of stem cells. They consist of a perikaryon and numerous projections arising from the cell pole directed toward the apical cells, the proposed niche of the GSCs. The projections can traverse a considerable distance until their terminals touch the apical cells. From hatching until death, the GSC projections undergo conspicuous changes, the sequence of which has been deduced from observations of all developmental stages. Projection formation starts from lobular cell protrusions showing trabecular ingrowths of the cell membrane. Finger-like projections result from a process of growth and "carving out". The newly formed projections contain mostly only free ribosomes other than a few mitochondria. A stereotyped degradation process commences in the projection terminals: profiles of circular, often concentric, cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum appear and turn into myelin bodies, whereas mitochondria become more numerous. The cytoplasm vesiculates, lysosomal bodies appear, and mitochondria become swollen. At the same time, the projection terminals are segregated by transverse ingrowths of the cell membrane. Finally, autophagic vacuoles and myelin bodies fill the segregated terminals, which then rupture. Simultaneously, new projections seem to sprout from the perikaryon of the GSCs. These dynamics, which are not synchronized among the GSCs, indicate that a novel type of signal exchange and transduction between the stem cells and their niche is involved in the regulation of asymmetric versus symmetric division of GSCs.

AB  - Optical fibers are drawn from preforms (fused silica glass rods) typically made up of two concentric cylinders (the core rod and the clad tube), which are usually joined in a separate fusion process. The setup time and hence manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced if the two cylinders can be joined in the same furnace in which the fiber is drawn. A good understanding of the transient temperature distribution is needed for controlling the feed rate to avoid thermally induced cracks. Since direct measurement of the temperature fields is often impossible, the geometrical design of the preform and the control of the feed rate have largely been accomplished by trials-and-errors. The ability to predict the transient temperature distribution and the thermally induced stresses will provide a rational basis to design optimization and feed rate control of the process. In this paper we present an analytical model to predict the transient conductive-radiative transfer as two partially joined, concentric glass cylinders with specular surfaces are fed into the furnace. Finite volume method (FVM) is used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The specular surface reflectivity is obtained by the Fresnel's law and the Snell's law. The boundary intensities are obtained through the coupling of the interior glass radiative transfer and the exterior furnace enclosure analysis. The model has been used to numerically study the transient conductive-radiative transfer in the advanced melting zone (AMZ) of an optic fiber drawing process. This problem is of both theoretical and practical interest in the manufacture of optical fibers. The computational method for the radiation transfer developed in this paper can also be applied to the simulation of the fiber drawing process and other glass-related manufacturing processes.

AB  - Rotavirus assembly is a multistep process that requires the successive association of four major structural proteins in three concentric layers. It has been assumed until now that VP4, the most external viral protein that forms the spikes of mature virions, associates with double-layer particles within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in conjunction with VP7 and with the help of a nonstructural protein, NSP4. VP7 and NSP4 are two glycosylated proteins. However, we recently described a strong association of VP4 with raft-type membrane microdomains, a result that makes the ER a highly questionable site for the final assembly of rotavirus, since rafts are thought to be absent from this compartment. In this study, we used tunicamycin (TM), a drug known to block the first step of protein N glycosylation, as a tool to dissect rotavirus assembly. We show that, as expected, TM blocks viral protein glycosylation and also decreases virus infectivity. In the meantime, viral particles were blocked as enveloped particles in the ER. Interestingly, TM does not prevent the targeting of VP4 to the cell surface nor its association with raft membranes, whereas the infectivity associated with the raft fractions strongly decreased. VP4 does not colocalize with the ER marker protein disulfide-isomerase even when viral particles were blocked by TM in this compartment. These results strongly support a primary role for raft membranes in rotavirus final assembly and the fact that VP4 assembly with the rest of the particle is an extrareticular event.

AB  - L-NAME-induced hypertension has been shown to produce concentric (eutrophic) remodeling of the heart despite an enhanced afterload. We postulated that nitric oxide synthase inhibition could limit coronary capillary growth to explain the nature of remodeling. To test our hypothesis, we aimed at determining the effect of endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide on coronary neovascularization. Aortic and coronary rings from normotensive animals were incubated in a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix in the presence of L-NAME or the nitric oxide donor SNAP. L-NAME inhibited, while SNAP stimulated, neovascularization from aortic and coronary rings after 12 days of in vitro incubation. In arterial rings harvested from rats treated with L-NAME for 14 days and in which no further in vitro treatment was added, only coronary rings showed a reduction in new capillary generation. While confirming that chronic L-NAME-treated rats develop concentric remodeling, the evaluation of capillary density did not reveal any difference as compared with the controls in 3 areas of the myocardium. In conclusion, chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis in vivo produces a longlasting reduction in the capacity of coronary arteries to generate new capillaries in vitro. Thus, our results lend support to the hypothesis that an inhibition of new capillary formation could prevent the development of compensatory ventricular hypertrophy, in favor of concentric remodeling.

AB  - The ability to gather information and assess risks in novel environments is crucial for survival and fitness in the wild. Our aim was to characterise behavioural strategies of exploration and risk assessment in novel environments and to investigate in what respects wild house mice differ from domesticated mice. A total of 39 adult male mice from three genetic backgrounds (Wild, BALB/c, and C57BL/6) were tested in three behavioural tests, the concentric square field (CSF), a modified open field (OF), and a conventional elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to spatial measures, behavioural measures of exploration and risk assessment were registered. The parameters were categorised according to their relevance to activity, exploration, approach-avoidance, and use of open areas/shelter. Wild mice had lower activity and a higher avoidance of open areas than the laboratory strains. No differences were found in exploratory motivation. The BALB/c mice avoided risk areas and showed high risk assessment (SAP), whereas C57BL/6 mice were more explorative and risk taking and showed little risk assessment. Wild mice seemed to have a different behavioural strategy of risk assessment in being more cautious before entering a potentially dangerous zone but explored all zones after assessed as nonrisky. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the animals' behaviour in the CSF arena supported these findings by clearly separating the three strains on the basis of their behavioural performances. It is concluded that there are obvious differences in behavioural strategies related to risk assessment and risk taking among wild mice versus domesticated house mice and also among laboratory strains. The relationship between the animal's risk concern and adaptability is discussed and should be a matter of importance considering animal welfare as well as the experimental aim and protocol.

AB  - Aim. Muscular strength is one of the most important components of sport, both for high performance and injury prevention. One of the most used methods to assess strength muscle balance between dominant (D)/non-dominant (ND) and antagonist/agonist is isokinetic testing. The main purpose of the present study was to describe and to compare isokinetic strength profiles (peak torque, bilateral strength differences between D/ND leg (BD) and hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio) in athletes of different sports and positional roles.
   Methods. Twenty-eight elite volleyball players and 47 pro soccer players (goalkeepers, n=5; full-backs, n=7; defenders, n=10; midfielders, n=15; forwards, n=10) were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex-System 2). Maximal gravity corrected concentric peak torque of knee extensor and flexor muscles were measured at angular velocities of 360degrees(.)s(-1) (6.28 rad(.)s(-1)) and 90degrees(.)s(-1) (1.57 rad(.)s(-1)). \
   Results. No significant BD were found between soccer and volleyball players with exception of hamstrings at 90degrees(.)s(-1) (soccer: 10.6+/-8.0% vs volleyball: 6.9+/-5.5%). The H/Q ratio was significantly lower in volleyball players at 90degrees(.)s(-1) (D: soccer 57.4+/-6.7% vs volleyball 50.4+/-7.2%; ND: soccer: 56.1+/-8.2% vs volleyball: 50.5+/-6.4%). No significant differences were found for BD and H/Q ratio in soccer players of different positional roles.
   Conclusion. In general, soccer and volleyball players do not seem to be different concerning BD although a significant difference was observed in hamstrings at 90degrees(.)s(-1). Moreover, our data suggest that specific demands of these sports and the different positional roles in soccer did not induce bilateral leg imbalances. However, sport demands seem to influence isokinetic concentric H/Q ratio.

AB  - A high-alpha, closed-loop flow-control system for missile yaw stabilization and enhanced maneuverability was designed, developed, and successfully demonstrated in a series of open- and closed-loop experiments on a fin-less 3:1 caliber tangent ogive missile model. The active flow-control-based yaw control system consisted of eight fast-response pressure sensors and eight deployable flow effectors arranged in concentric rings on the missile nose cone. The devices were integrated with a closed-loop controller that modulated the effectors to manipulate flow asymmetry around the missile forebody. Side forces caused by crossflow separation and forebody flow asymmetries were observed on the missile model between 40 and 60 deg alpha. Parametric studies showed that actuating flow effectors in certain configurations resulted in cancellation of large side forces associated with the natural flow asymmetry under both steady and unsteady flow conditions. Exploratory studies conducted on optimized flow effector configurations resulted in control maps with wide spectrum of positive and negative side forces for yaw modulation. Dynamic experiments successfully demonstrated the ability of the closed-loop control system to generate and maintain a range of desired yawing moments during high-alpha pitch sweeps.

AB  - Optical fibers are drawn from preforms (fused silica glass rods) typically made up of two concentric cylinders (the core rod and the clad tube), which are usually joined in a separate fusion process. The setup time and hence manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced if the two cylinders can be joined in the same furnace in which the fiber is drawn. A good understanding of the transient temperature distribution is needed for controlling the feed rate to avoid thermally induced cracks. Since direct measurement of the temperature fields is often impossible, the geometrical design of the preform and the control of the feed rate have largely been accomplished by trials-and-errors. The ability to predict the transient temperature distribution and the thermally induced stresses will provide a rational basis to design optimization and feed rate control of the process. In this paper, we present an analytical model to predict the transient conductive-radiative transfer as two partially joined, concentric glass cylinders with specular surfaces are fed into the furnace. Finite volume method (FVM) is used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The specular surface reflectivity is obtained by the Fresnel's law and the Snells law. The boundary intensities are obtained through the coupling of the interior glass radiative transfer and the exterior furnace enclosure analysis. The model has been used to numerically study the transient conductive-radiative transfer in the advanced melting zone (AMZ) of an optic fiber drawing process. This problem is of both theoretical and practical interest in the manufacture of optical fibers. The computational method for the radiation transfer developed in this paper can also be applied to the simulation of the fiber drawing process and other glass-related manufacturing processes.

AB  - An unusual specimen of Aglais urticae, lacking characteristic UV-reflecting parafocal eyespot elements along the margins of both fore and hind wings, is compared with normal, wild-type specimens. Wing scales, responsible for generating structural coloration, are missing in the! abnormal individual and have been replaced with a type that is typical of pigment-based colours. Other modifications seen in the abnormal specimen include firstly, a distal expansion of a uniformly brown region, that otherwise occupies a proximal position on the hind wings of the wild type, and secondly, the lack of a characteristic orange cross-vein band that runs proximal to the parafocal eyespot elements on the hind wing. The differences in coloration between abnormal and wild type are seen as evidence of a proximal-distal developmental axis (originally proposed by Nijhout 1991) and support a view recently aired by Beldade and Brakefield (2003). It is now clear that studies on butterfly eyespot development must consider not only pigment-containing scales, but also the structurally modified scales responsible for physical colours, i.e. LTV reflectivity.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is principally derived from vagal and sacral neural crest cells that migrate throughout the gastrointestinal tract before differentiating into neurons and glia. These cells form two concentric rings of ganglia and regulate intestinal motility, absorption, and secretion. Abnormalities of ENS development can lead to disorders of intestinal function, including Hirschsprung's disease. These disorders are generally limited to the distal hindgut, suggesting unique features to development of this region. This study characterized the normal spatiotemporal development of the ENS within the avian hindgut. Neural crest cells begin to populate the hindgut at E8, with patterning of both plexuses complete by embryonic day 9. Crest-derived cells arrive in the submucosal layer before the myenteric layer, as well as differentiate to a neuronal phenotype first. The cloaca demonstrates a unique pattern, characterized by a disorganized myenteric plexus and a flattened nerve of Remak. Detailed understanding of normal avian hindgut ENS development will allow better utilization of this model system to study abnormalities of the intestinal nervous system.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this work is to individuate the effects of different muscular strength training methodologies, on the risk of injuries in the soccer game with 5 players. Usually, the efficacy of the athletic preparation is valued in relation to the performance improvement in the different motor expressions speeded up from the specific discipline or in relation to the keeping of the same performance for all the sports season. The evaluation of the presented training, through the definition of costs, for what concerns injuries and benefits, for what concerns the evaluation of the motor skills, can help the technical staff to optimise the performance, avoiding penalizing interruptions.
   Methods. It has been monitored the injuries of 2 groups of soccer players subjected to 2 different strength trainings: by means of overloads (GS) and multi-jumps (GMB). The evaluation of the elevation of the centre of gravity, through concentric contraction and stretching-shortening cycle, has been realized by means of a conductance - spring board Ergojump of Bosco, according to the-squat jump protocol (SJ) and the counter movement jump (CMJ). The acceleration has been estimated through a sprint of 20 m with the start from a still point; the evaluation of the maximal aerobic speed (VMA) has been realized through the test of Leger, version maximal multistage 20 m shuttle. In order to evaluate the risk of injurie, it has been calculated the index for 1 000 h of sports activity, without considering the days of inability deriving from a bony, muscular or articular contusion.
   Results. The GS has pointed out a risk of injurie of 29.3 h of inability every 1 000 hof activity, against 102.4 h of inability recorded in GMB. There is a significant difference (p<0.001). The Gs has also underlined very few differences as for the elevation of centre of gravity, but significant variations as for the VMA (p<0.05).
   Conclusion. The report has underlined that the power activities realized by multi-jumps have a risk of injury which is higher, compared with the activities realized with overloadings. It is also possible to hypotisize that such a high injury rate includes the evolution of some movement abilities, with a particular reference to the ability of speeding up and to the VMA. Controlling the efficacy of the athletic preparation, for what concerns risks, besides benefits, has pointed out the problem of the concurrent training in the sports plays: that is the influence and the transfer of adapting oneself, deriving from the training sessions for movement performances in reciprocal metabolic competition. The preposition of jump-trainings, rather than the replacement of this with overloads, represents the natural succession of it.

AB  - This paper provides the first description of the Haswell cells at the ultrastructural level, as well as giving an insight into their function. Two species of Temnocephalidae were studied, Temnocephala iheringi and T. haswelli. Haswell cells are identical in both species, and their structure indicates that they have a secretory function. They are highly interdigitated with parenchymal cells and are usually joined to them by cup-like desmosomes. Nuclei are irregular, with a honeycomb structure and perichromatin granules. The most prominent organelle is granular endoplasmic reticulum, which is typically arranged in concentric rings that usually encircle a conspicuous Golgi complex. Secretion bodies are secreted via projections of the Haswell cells that reach the surface in the anterior portion of the body and in the tentacles. Distinct pores with a size and distribution consistent with the TEM observations were seen under SEM in these regions.

AB  - Background - Recent studies suggest that posttranslation processing or "shedding" (ie, secretion) of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme ( TACE) may contribute to the left ventricular (LV) remodeling that occurs in the failing human heart.
   Methods and Results - To address the functional significance of TNF shedding, we generated lines of transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of secreted wild-type (MHCsTNF2) TNF and overexpression of a mutated noncleavable transmembrane form of TNF (MHCmTNF). Both lines of mice had overlapping levels of myocardial TNF protein; however, the phenotypes of the MHCsTNF2 and MHCmTNF mice were strikingly disparate. Whereas the MHCmTNF mice developed a concentric LV hypertrophy phenotype, the MHCsTNF2 mice developed a dilated LV phenotype. The fibrillar collagen weave in MHCmTNF mice with concentric hypertrophy was characterized by thick collagen fibrils and increased collagen content, whereas the fibrillar collagen weave in the MHCsTNF2 mice with LV dilation was characterized by a diminished collagen content. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases with a broad-based matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor prevented LV dilation in the MHCsTNF2 mice.
   Conclusions - These findings suggest that posttranslational processing of TNF, as opposed to TNF expression per se, is responsible for the adverse cardiac remodeling that occurs after sustained TNF overexpression.
