AB  - Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begründer moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefaßt, als unter Ethologen gebräuchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher übersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollständigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortführung des Gesprächs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verhältnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachlässigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einschätzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, daß er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bewährtes “biologisches Denken” folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Daß er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorgänger angeknüpft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als daß jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz‘ Arbeit zu sein, daß er klar gesehen hat, daß Verhaltensweisen Teile von “Organen”, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; daß ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorgänge, daß ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, daß Verhaltensontogenie in grundsätzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und daß die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch kühne Hypothesen gefördert als durch eigene Nachprüfung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachprüfung zu unterschätzen — ohne die es natürlich keine Weiterentwicklung gäbe — möchte ich doch behaupten, daß die durch Nachprüfung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des ursprünglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, daß eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt ‐ ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum übersehen können. Am Schluß noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort “Ethologie” auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon längst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das heißt natürlich nicht, daß ich den Namen Ethologie für dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das wäre geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist natürlich gleichgültig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, daß wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, für die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: “Verhaltensbiologie”. Selbstverständlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Brücken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen stärker beeinflußt hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon überzeugt, daß diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und daß die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht. 1963 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Natural selection favors signals, receptors, and signaling behavior that maximize the received signals relative to background noise and minimize signal degradation. Properties of sensory systems bias the direction of evolution of the signals that they receive. Females may prefer males whose signals they can perceive more easily, and this will lead to the spread of more easily perceived male traits. Environmental conditions during signal transmission and detection also affect signal perception. Specific environmental conditions will bias the evolutionary direction of behavior, which affects the time and place of signaling as well as microhabitat preferences. Increased specialization of microhabitats and signaling behavior may lead to biased evolution of the sensory systems to work more efficiently. Thus, sensory systems, signals, signaling behavior, and habitat choice are evolutionarily coupled. These suites of traits should coevolve in predictable directions, determined by environmental biophysics, neurobiology, and the genetics of the suites of traits (hence the term "sensory drive'). -from Author

AB  - Startle is a fast response to sudden, intense stimuli and probably protects the organism from injury by a predator or by a blow. The acoustic startle response (ASR) of mammals is mediated by a relatively simple neuronal circuit located in the lower brainstem. Neurons of the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) are key elements of this primary ASR pathway.The ASR in humans and animals has a non-zero baseline, that is, the response magnitude can be increased or decreased by a variety of pathological conditions and experimental manipulations. Therefore, the ASR has been used as a behavioral tool to assess the neuronal basis of behavioral plasticity and to model neuropathological dysfunctions of sensorimotor information processing.Cross-species examples for the increase of the ASR magnitude are sensitization, fear-potentiation and drug-induced enhancement. Examples for the reduction of the ASR magnitude are habituation, prepulse inhibition, drug-induced inhibition and the attenuation by positive affect.This review describes the neuronal basis underlying the mediation of the ASR, as well as the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of different phenomena of enhancement and attenuation of the ASR.It also attempts to elucidate the biological background of these forms of behavioral plasticity. Special emphasis is put on the potential relevance of ASR modulations for the understanding of human psychiatric and neurological diseases. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Data will be reviewed using the acoustic startle reflex in rats and humans based on our attempts to operationally define fear vs anxiety. Although the symptoms of fear and anxiety are very similar, they also differ. Fear is a generally adaptive state of apprehension that begins rapidly and dissipates quickly once the threat is removed (phasic fear). Anxiety is elicited by less specific and less predictable threats, or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant. Thus, anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension (sustained fear). Rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala, which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear. Sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala, which releases corticotropin-releasing factor, a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the so-called extended amygdala. The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. In rats, sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. In humans, symptoms of clinical anxiety are better detected in sustained rather than phasic fear paradigms. © 2010 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - In studies of animal colouration it is no longer necessary to rely on subjective assessments of colour and conspicuousness, nor on methods which rely upon human vision. This is important because animals vary greatly in colour vision and colour is context‐dependent. New methods make it practical to measure the colour spectrum of pattern elements (patches) of animals and their visual backgrounds for the conditions under which patch spectra reach the conspecific's, predator's or prey's eyes. These methods can be used in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. A patch's colour is dependent not only upon its reflectance spectrum, but also upon the ambient light spectrum, the transmission properties of air or water, and the veiling light spectrum. These factors change with time of day, weather, season and microhabitat, so colours must be measured under the conditions prevalent when colour patterns are normally used. Methods of measuring, classifying and comparing colours are presented, as well as techniques for assessing the conspicuousness of colour patterns as a whole. Some implications of the effect of environmental light and vision are also discussed. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Forests exhibit much variation in light environments, and this can affect communication among animals, communication between animals and plants, photosynthesis, and plant morphogenesis. Light environments are caused by, and can be predicted from, the geometry of the light paths, the weather conditions, and the time of day. The structure of forests leads to four major light habitats when the sun is not blocked by clouds: forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and large gaps. These are characterized by yellow-green, blue-gray, reddish, and "white" ambient light spectra, respectively. When the sun is blocked by clouds, the spectra of these four habitats converge on that of large gaps and open areas, so the single light environment during cloudy weather will be called open/cloudy. An additional light environment (early/late) is associated with low sun angles (near dawn or dusk); it is purplish. Each light environment is well defined and was found in forests of Trinidad, Panama, Costa Rica, Australia, California, and Florida. Scattered literature references suggest similar patterns elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Java. Perceived colors of animals, flowers, and fruits depend upon the interaction between ambient light color and the reflectance color of the animal or plant parts. As a result, an animal or plant may have a different appearance in each environment, i.e., a color pattern may be relatively cryptic in some light environments while relatively conspicuous in others. This has strong implications for the joint evolution of visual signals and vision, as well as microhabitat choice. Plant growth and form may also be affected by variation in the color of forest light.

AB  - The basic building blocks of communication are signals, assembled in various sequences and combinations, and used in virtually all inter- and intra-specific interactions. While signal evolution has long been a focus of study, there has been a recent resurgence of interest and research in the complexity of animal displays. Much past research on signal evolution has focused on sensory specialists, or on single signals in isolation, but many animal displays involve complex signaling, or the combination of more than one signal or related component, often serially and overlapping, frequently across multiple sensory modalities. Here, we build a framework of functional hypotheses of complex signal evolution based on content-driven (ultimate) and efficacy-driven (proximate) selection pressures (sensu Guilford and Dawkins 1991). We point out key predictions for various hypotheses and discuss different approaches to uncovering complex signal function. We also differentiate a category of hypotheses based on inter-signal interactions. Throughout our review, we hope to make three points: (1) a complex signal is a functional unit upon which selection can act, (2) both content and efficacy-driven selection pressures must be considered when studying the evolution of complex signaling, and (3) individual signals or components do not necessarily contribute to complex signal function independently, but may interact in a functional way. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Despite decades of interest, the adaptive significance of the extraordinary diversity in the design of animal signals remains elusive. It is suggested that signal design consists of two components: 'strategic design' and 'efficacy'. Strategic design is concerned with how a signal is constructed by natural selection to provide the information necessary to make a receiver respond (e.g. by being good at displaying underlying quality), whilst efficacy is concerned with how a signal is designed to get that information across to the receiver (e.g. by being easily measured). It is argued that an important but neglected evolutionary force on animal signals is therefore the psychology of the signal receiver, and that three aspects of receiver psychology (what a receiver finds easy to detect, easy to discriminate and easy to remember) constitute powerful selective forces in signal design. Greatest emphasis is given to memorability because this has been least considered by previous authors. It is argued that learning and memory are involved in a wide range of signals, and numerous hypotheses as to how signals may be adapted to be more memorable to receivers are suggested. The relationship of this analysis to earlier attempts at understanding signals is explored, particularly with reference to the concepts of honesty, manipulation and mind-reading. © 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow of normal subjects, while they were discriminating different attributes (shape, color, and velocity) of the same set of visual stimuli. Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes was higher when subjects focused attention on one attribute than when they divided attention among several attributes. Correspondingly, attention enhanced the activity of different regions of extrastriate visual cortex that appear to be specialized for processing information related to the selected attribute.

AB  - Recent theories regarding the evolution of predator-prey interactions is reviewed. This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.

AB  - Bioluminescence spans all oceanic dimensions and has evolved many times from bacteria to fish to powerfully influence behavioral and ecosystem dynamics. New methods and technology have brought great advances in understanding of the molecular basis of bioluminescence, its physiological control, and its significance in marine communities. Novel tools derived from understanding the chemistry of natural light-producing molecules have led to countless valuable applications, culminating recently in a related Nobel Prize. Marine organisms utilize bioluminescence for vital functions ranging from defense to reproduction. To understand these interactions and the distributions of luminous organisms, new instruments and platforms allow observations on individual to oceanographic scales. This review explores recent advances, including the chemical and molecular, phylogenetic and functional, community and oceanographic aspects of bioluminescence. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - During flight, many insect wings undergo dramatic deformations that are controlled largely by the architecture of the wing. The pattern of supporting veins in wings varies widely among insect orders and families, but the functional significance of phylogenetic trends in wing venation remains unknown, and measurements of the mechanical properties of wings are rare. In this study, we address the relationship between venation pattern and wing flexibility by measuring the flexural stiffness of wings (in both the spanwise and chordwise directions) and quantifying wing venation in 16 insect species from six orders. These measurements show that spanwise flexural stiffness scales strongly with the cube of wing span, whereas chordwise flexural stiffness scales with the square of chord length. Wing size accounts for over 95% of the variability in measured flexural stiffness; the residuals of this relationship are small and uncorrelated with standardized independent contrasts of wing venation characters. In all species tested, spanwise flexural stiffness is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than chordwise flexural stiffness. A finite element model of an insect wing demonstrates that leading edge veins are crucial in generating this spanwise-chordwise anisotropy.

AB  - The spectral sensitivities of avian retinal photoreceptors are examined with respect to microspectrophotometric measurements of single cells, spectrophotometric measurements of extracted or in vitro regenerated visual pigments, and molecular genetic analyses of visual pigment opsin protein sequences. Bird species from diverse orders are compared in relation to their evolution, their habitats and the multiplicity of visual tasks they must perform. Birds have five different types of visual pigment and seven different types of photoreceptor - rods, double (uneven twin) cones and four types of single cone. The spectral locations of the wavelengths of maximum absorbance (λmax) of the different visual pigments, and the spectral transmittance characteristics of the intraocular spectral filters (cone oil droplets) that also determine photoreceptor spectral sensitivity, vary according to both habitat and phylogenetic relatedness. The primary influence on avian retinal design appears to be the range of wavelengths available for vision, regardless of whether that range is determined by the spectral distribution of the natural illumination or the spectral transmittance of the ocular media (cornea, aqueous humour, lens, vitreous humour). Nevertheless, other variations in spectral sensitivity exist that reflect the variability and complexity of avian visual ecology. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review describes the neuronal mechanisms underlying the mediation and modulation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) in rats. The combination of anatomical, physiological and behavioral methods has identified pathways which mediate and modulate the ASR. The ASR is mediated by a relatively simple, oligosynaptic pathway located in the lower brainstem which activates spinal and cranial motor neurons. An important element of the pathway which mediates the ASR is the caudal nucleus of the pontine reticular formation (PnC). Interestingly, this nucleus is also the target of input from various brain nuclei which are involved in the modulation (e.g. fear- potentiation, sensitization, habituation, prepulse inhibition and pleasure- attenuation) of the ASR. Hence, the PnC can be described as a sensorimotor interface, where the transition of sensory input into the motor output can be directly influenced by excitatory or inhibitory afferents. On the basis of these facts we conclude that the ASR may be a valuable model for the study of general principles of sensorimotor-motivational information processing at the behavioral and neurophysiological level in mammals.

AB  - The traditional emphasis when measuring performance in animal cognition has been overwhelmingly on accuracy, independent of decision time. However, more recently, it has become clear that tradeoffs exist between decision speed and accuracy in many ecologically relevant tasks, for example, prey and predator detection and identification; pollinators choosing between flower species; and spatial exploration strategies. Obtaining high-quality information often increases sampling time, especially under noisy conditions. Here we discuss the mechanisms generating such speed-accuracy tradeoffs, their implications for animal decision making (including signalling, communication and mate choice) and the significance of differences in decision strategies among species, populations and individuals. The ecological relevance of such tradeoffs can be better understood by considering the neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making processes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several features of the evolution of eyes and photoreceptors are examined in an effort to explore the relative roles of adaptation and historical and developmental constraints. Optical design shows clear evidence of adaptation, which in some respects approaches optima predictable from physics. The primate fovea, on the other hand, illustrates how adaptation can be channeled by developmental heritage. The primary structures of opsins reveal multiple evolutionary lineages within both Drosophila and humans. The pigments of vertebrate rods comprise a subset of opsins whose evolutionary relationships map onto the phylogeny of the parent species. The evolutionary reasons for why most rod pigments absorb maximally at 500 ± 10 nm are obscure, as there is no convincing explanation based on adaptation alone. Rods are appropriately distinguished from cones on the basis of which opsin gene is expressed. This criterion is likely to be in conflict with other definitions in phyletic lines (e.g., geckos, snakes) that have long diurnal or nocturnal histories accompanied by loss of one or more opsin genes, followed by a secondary adaptation to life in a different photic environment. Color vision - a generalizable perception associated with the spectral composition of light - is usefully distinguished from wavelength-specific behaviors. The latter are also based on multiple visual pigments and more than one spectral class of receptors but cannot be altered by learning. The distinction is particularly forceful in bees, which exhibit both kinds of behavior. The evolution of primate color vision has been shaped by historical factors involving an extensive period of early mammalian nocturnality. Birds, by contrast, have more elaborate cones and a richer set of visual pigments. Avion color space can be represented in a tetrahedron.

AB  - Survival in threatening situations depends on the selection and rapid execution of an appropriate active or passive defensive response, yet the underlying brain circuitry is not understood. Here we use circuit-based optogenetic, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical tracing methods to define midbrain periaqueductal grey circuits for specific defensive behaviours. We identify an inhibitory pathway from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey that produces freezing by disinhibition of ventrolateral periaqueductal grey excitatory outputs to pre-motor targets in the magnocellular nucleus of the medulla. In addition, we provide evidence for anatomical and functional interaction of this freezing pathway with long-range and local circuits mediating flight. Our data define the neuronal circuitry underlying the execution of freezing, an evolutionarily conserved defensive behaviour, which is expressed by many species including fish, rodents and primates. In humans, dysregulation of this 'survival circuit' has been implicated in anxiety-related disorders. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Color patterns of natural populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are a compromise between sexual selection and predation avoidance. Field data on ambient light spectra, water transmission spectra, courtship and attack distances, and cone pigments of guppies and their predators were used to calculate measures of conspicuousness of guppies under various combinations of visual conditions and vision. The results suggest that color patterns are relatively more conspicuous to guppies at the times and places of courtship and relatively less conspicuous at the times and places of maximum predator risk. Some implications to the evolution of vision, visual communication and behavior are discussed. © 1991.

AB  - Assessment of color using human vision (or standards based thereon) is central to tests of many evolutionary hypotheses. Yet fundamental differences in color vision between humans and other animals call this approach into question. Here we use techniques for objectively assessing color patterns that avoid reliance on species-specific (e.g., human) perception. Reflectance spectra are the invariant features that we expert the animal's color cognition to have evolved to extract. We performed multivariate analyses on principal components derived from >2,600 reflectance spectra (300-720 nm) sampled in a stratified random design from different body regions of male and female starlings in breeding plumage. Starlings possess spatially complex plumage patterns and extensive areas of iridescence. Our study revealed previously unnotices sex differences in plumage coloration and the nature of iridescent and noniridescent sex differences. Sex differences occurred in some body regions but not others, were more pronounced at some wavelengths (both ultraviolet anti human visible), and involved differences in mean reflectance anti spectral shape. Discriminant analysis based on principal components were sufficient to sex correctly 100% of our sample. If hidden sexual dichromatism is widespread, then it has important implications for classifications of animals as mono- or dimorphic and for taxonomic and conservation purposes.

AB  - The colour patterns of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, represent a balance between selection for crypsis (by predators) and selection for conspicuousness (by females). To a predator or mate, the conspicuousness of a colour pattern depends on environmental light conditions at the time of viewing. In this study light intensity and predation had significant effects on male courtship behaviour in guppies. Males courted less and used visually conspicuous behavioural elements less often in the presence of predators or under high light levels. Maximum risk due to predation naturally occurs at the highest light intensities, so either light intensity or the presence of a predator can be used as a cue for predator avoidance. Guppies minimized predator risk during courtship by shifting visually conspicuous displays to times of day when visual predation is minimal, and using the visually less conspicuous sneak copulation strategy when predation risk is greatest. Because ambient light conditions vary with time of day, the same colour patterns are seen under different visual conditions by predators and mates. Such context-dependent conspicuousness reduces the need for an evolutionary compromise between colour patterns that reduce the risk of visual predation and those that increase visibility to females. © 1987.

AB  - In comparison with social learning about food, social learning about predators has received little attention. Yet such research is of potential interest to students of animal cognition and conservation biologists. I summarize evidence for social learning about predators by fish, birds, eutherian mammals, and marsupials. I consider the proposal that this phenomenon is a case of S-S classical conditioning and suggest that evolution may have modified some of the properties of learning to accommodate for the requirements of learning socially about danger. I discuss some between-species differences in the properties of socially acquired predator avoidance and suggest that learning may be faster and more robust in species in which alarm behavior reliably predicts high predatory threat. Finally, I highlight how studies of socially acquired predator avoidance can inform the design of prerelease antipredator training programs for endangered species.

AB  - 1. A characteristic behaviour, the 'Mauthner-initiated startle response', was recorded and quantitatively analysed with high-speed cinematography (200 frames/sec) after vibrational stimulation in 11 of 13 teleost species which possess Mauthner cells. 2. The latency of the response is 5-10 msec. This behaviour has: (a) an initial phase, the 'fast-body-bend', lasting about 20 msec and consisting of a stereotyped displacement of the head and tail to one side and (b), a second phase, the 'return-flip', consisting of a non-stereotyped flip of the tail to the opposite side. 3. Within 100 msec after the start of the Mauthner-initiated startle response, most fish were displaced 0-5-1-5 body lengths from their initial position. The variability of the animal's location after 100 msec suggests that the behaviour is adaptively non-predictable; 4. In goldfish, the Mauthner-initiated startle response could also be elicited by visual stimulation. 5. We conclude that the fast-body-bend is the direct result of activation of one Mauthner cell and its spinal motor neurone pool. 6. In four species we described examples of apparently non-Mauthner initiated startle responses.

AB  - HUMANS and certain other species find symmetrical patterns more attractive than asymmetrical ones. These preferences may appear in response to biological signals1-3, or in situations where there is no obvious signalling context, such as exploratory behaviour4,5 and human aesthetic response to pattern6-8. It has been proposed9,10 that preferences for symmetry have evolved in animals because the degree of symmetry in signals indicates the signaller's quality. By contrast, we show here that symmetry preferences may arise as a by-product of the need to recognize objects irrespective of their position and orientation in the visual field. The existence of sensory biases for symmetry may have been exploited independently by natural selection acting on biological signals and by human artistic innovation. This may account for the observed convergence on symmetrical forms in nature and decorative art11. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Butterfly wings display pattern elements of many types and colors. To identify the molecular processes underlying the generation of these patterns, several butterfly cognates of Drosophila appendage patterning genes have been cloned and their expression patterns have been analyzed. Butterfly wing patterns are organized by two spatial coordinate systems. One system specifies positional information with respect to the entire wing field and is conserved between fruit flies and butterflies. A second system, superimposed on the general system and involving several of the same genes, operates within each wing subdivision to elaborate discrete pattern elements. Eyespots, which form from discrete developmental organizers, are marked by Distal-less gene expression. These circular pattern elements appear to be generated by a process similar to, and perhaps evolved from, proximodistal pattern formation in insect appendages.

AB  - The theory of warning signals dates back to Wallace but is still confusing, controversial and complex. Because predator avoidance of warningly coloured prey (aposematism) is based upon learning and reinforcement, it is difficult to understand how initially rare conspicuous forms subsequently become common. Here, we discuss several possible resolutions to this apparent paradox. Many of these ideas have been largely ignored as a result of implicit assumptions about predator behaviour and assumed lack of variation in the predators, prey and the predation process. Considering the spatial and temporal variation in and mechanisms of behaviour of both predators and prey will make it easier to understand the process and evolution of aposematism. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Much of brain science is concerned with understanding the neural circuits that underlie specific behaviors. While the mouse has become a favorite experimental subject, the behaviors of this species are still poorly explored. For example, the mouse retina, like that of other mammals, contains ∼20 different circuits that compute distinct features of the visual scene [1, 2]. By comparison, only a handful of innate visual behaviors are known in this species - the pupil reflex [3], phototaxis [4], the optomotor response [5], and the cliff response [6] - two of which are simple reflexes that require little visual processing. We explored the behavior of mice under a visual display that simulates an approaching object, which causes defensive reactions in some other species [7, 8]. We show that mice respond to this stimulus either by initiating escape within a second or by freezing for an extended period. The probability of these defensive behaviors is strongly dependent on the parameters of the visual stimulus. Directed experiments identify candidate retinal circuits underlying the behavior and lead the way into detailed study of these neural pathways. This response is a new addition to the repertoire of innate defensive behaviors in the mouse that allows the detection and avoidance of aerial predators. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A primary difference between predators and parasites is the number of victims that an individual attacks throughout a life-history stage. A key division within natural enemies is whether a successful attack eliminates the fitness of the prey or the host. A third distinctive axis for parasites is whether the host must die to further parasite development. The presence or absence of intensity-dependent pathology is a fourth factor that separates macroparasites from microparasites; this also distinguishes between social and solitary predators. Combining these four dichotomies defines seven types of parasitism, seven corresponding parasites, three forms of predation and, when one considers obligate and facultative combinations of these forms, four types of predator. Here, we argue that the energetics underlying the relative and absolute sizes of natural enemies and their victims is the primary selective factor responsible for the evolution of these different trophic strategies.

AB  - To gain insights into the evolution and ecology of visually acute animals such as birds, biologists often need to understand how these animals perceive colors. This poses a problem, since the human eye is of a different design than that of most other animals. The standard solution is to examine the spectral sensitivity properties of animal retinas through microspectrophotometry - a procedure that is rather complicated and therefore only has allowed examinations of a limited number of species to date. We have developed a faster and simpler molecular method, which can be used to estimate the color sensitivities of a bird by sequencing a part of the gene coding for the ultraviolet or violet absorbing opsin in the avian retina. With our method, there is no need to sacrifice the animal, and it thereby facilitates large screenings, including rare and endangered species beyond the reach of microspectrophotometry. Color vision in birds may be categorized into two classes: one with a short-wavelength sensitivity biased toward violet (VS) and the other biased toward ultraviolet (UVS). Using our method on 45 species from 35 families, we demonstrate that the distribution of avian color vision is more complex than has previously been shown. Our data support VS as the ancestral state in birds and show that UVS has evolved independently at least four times. We found species with the UVS type of color vision in the orders Psittaciformes and Passeriformes, in agreement with previous findings. However, species within the families Corvidae and Tyrannidae did not share this character with other passeriforms. We also found UVS type species within the Laridae and Struthionidae families. Raptors (Accipitridae and Falconidae) are of the violet type, giving them a vision system different from their passeriform prey. Intriguing effects on the evolution of color signals can be expected from interactions between predators and prey. Such interactions may explain the presence of UVS in Laridae and Passeriformes.

AB  - The ubiquity of multiple signalling is a long-standing puzzle in the study of animal communication: given the costs of producing and receiving signals, why use more than a single cue? Focusing on sexually selected signals, I argue that dynamic variation in selection pressures can often explain why multiple signals coexist. In contrast to earlier research, which has taken a largely static view of the world, new insights highlight how fluctuations in ecological and social environments, as well as non-equilibrium dynamics intrinsic to coevolutionary systems, can maintain both multiple redundant and non-redundant signals. Future challenges will include identifying the circumstances under which environmental fluctuations lead to multiple signalling, and the consequences of such fluctuations for speciation in multiple-signalling species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The chromatophores of cephalopods differ fundamentally from those of other animals: they are neuromuscular organs rather than cells and are not controlled hormonally. They constitute a unique motor system that operates upon the environment without applying any force to it. Each chromatophore organ comprises an elastic sacculus containing pigment, to which is attached a set of obliquely striated radial muscles, each with its nerves and glia. When excited the muscles contract, expanding the chromatophore; when they relax, energy stored in the elastic sacculus retracts it. The physiology and pharmacology of the chromatophore nerves and muscles of loliginid squids are discussed in detail. Attention is drawn to the multiple innervation of dorsal mantle chromatophores, of crucial importance in pattern generation. The size and density of the chromatophores varies according to habit and lifestyle. Differently coloured chromatophores are distributed precisely with respect to each other, and to reflecting structures beneath them. Some of the rules for establishing this exact arrangement have been elucidated by ontogenetic studies. The chromatophores are not innervated uniformly: specific nerve fibres innervate groups of chromatophores within the fixed, morphological array, producing 'physiological units' expressed as visible 'chromatomotor fields'. The chromatophores are controlled by a set of lobes in the brain organized hierarchically. At the highest level, the optic lobes, acting largely on visual information, select specific motor programmes (i.e. body patterns); at the lowest level, motoneurons in the chromatophore lobes execute the programmes, their activity or inactivity producing the patterning seen in the skin. In Octopus vulgaris there are over half a million neurons in the chromatophore lobes, and receptors for all the classical neurotransmitters are present, different transmitters being used to activate (or inhibit) the different colour classes of chromatophore motoneurons. A detailed understanding of the way in which the brain controls body patterning still eludes us: the entire system apparently operates without feedback, visual or proprioceptive. The gross appearance of a cephalopod is termed its body pattern. This comprises a number of components, made up of several units, which in turn contains many elements: the chromatophores themselves and also reflecting cells and skin muscles. Neural control of the chromatophores enables a cephalopod to change its appearance almost instantaneously, a key feature in some escape behaviours and during agonistic signalling. Equally important, it also enables them to generate the discrete patterns so essential for camouflage or for signalling. The primary function of the chromatophores is camouflage. They are used to match the brightness of the background and to produce components that help the animal achieve general resemblance to the substrate or break up the body's outline. Because the chromatophores are neurally controlled an individual can, at any moment, select and exhibit one particular body pattern out of many. Such rapid neural polymorphism ('polyphenism') may hinder search-image formation by predators. Another function of the chromatophores is communication. Intraspecific signalling is well documented in several inshore species, and interspecific signalling, using ancient, highly conserved patterns, is also widespread. Neurally controlled chromatophores lend themselves supremely well to communication, allowing rapid, finely graded and bilateral signalling.

AB  - Visual mimicry is a textbook case of selection because it is both intuitively understandable and has repeatedly evolved in a range of organisms: it is the ultimate example of parallel evolution. In many mimetic groups, particularly butterflies, a huge variety of colour patterns has arisen, even in closely related species. There has been much recent controversy over explanations of this variety. Mimicry os today a broad field of evolutionary study; here we discuss the evolution of its diversity in predator-prey systems.

AB  - Frequency-dependent predation may maintain or prevent colour pattern polymorphisms in prey, and can be caused by a variety of biological phenomena, including perceptual processes (search images), optimal foraging and learning. Most species are preyed upon by more than one predator species, which are likely to differ in foraging styles, perceptual and learning abilities. Depending upon the interaction between predator vision, background and colour pattern parameters, certain morphs may be actively maintained in some conditions and not in others, even with the same predators. More than one kind of predator will also affect stability, and only slight changes in conditions can cause a transition between polymorphism and monomorphism. Frequency-dependent selection is not a panacea for the explanation of variation in animal colour patterns, although it may be important in some systems.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology has encouraged a change of research emphasis from the sorting of phenotypic variation by natural selection to the production of that variation through development. Some morphologies are more readily generated than others, and developmental mechanisms can limit or channel evolutionary change. Such biases determine how readily populations are able to respond to selection, and have been postulated to explain stasis in morphological evolution and unexplored morphologies. There has been much discussion about evolutionary constraints but empirical data testing them directly are sparse. The spectacular diversity in butterfly wing patterns is suggestive of how little constrained morphological evolution can be. However, for wing patterns involving serial repeats of the same element, developmental properties suggest that some directions of evolutionary change might be restricted. Here we show that despite the developmental coupling between different eyespots in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, there is great potential for independent changes. This flexibility is consistent with the diversity of wing patterns across species and argues for a dominant role of natural selection, rather than internal constraints, in shaping existing variation.

AB  - Background: A fundamental challenge of evolutionary and developmental biology is understanding how new characters arise and change. The recently derived eyespots on butterfly wings vary extensively in number and pattern between species and play important roles in predator avoidance. Eyespots form through the activity of inductive organizers (foci) at the center of developing eyespot fields. Foci are the proposed source of a morphogen, the levels of which determine the color of surrounding wing scale cells. However, it is unknown how reception of the focal signal translates into rings of different-colored scales, nor how different color schemes arise in different species. Results: We have identified several transcription factors, including butterfly homologs of the Drosophila Engrailed/Invected and Spalt proteins, that are deployed in concentric territories corresponding to the future rings of pigmented scales that compose the adult eyespot. We have isolated a new Bicyclus anynana wing pattern mutant, Goldeneye, in which the scales of one inner color ring become the color of a different ring. These changes correlate with shifts in transcription factor expression, suggesting that Goldeneye affects an early regulatory step in eyespot color patterning. In different butterfly species, the same transcription factors are expressed in eyespot fields, but in different relative spatial domains that correlate with divergent eyespot color schemes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that signaling from the focus induces nested rings of regulatory gene expression that subsequently control the final color pattern. Furthermore, the remarkably plastic regulatory interactions downstream of focal signaling have facilitated the evolution of eyespot diversity.

AB  - Clinical observation suggests that social phobia is characterised by eye avoidance in social interaction, reflecting an exaggerated social sensitivity. These reports are consistent with cognitive models of social phobia that emphasize the role of interpersonal processing biases. Yet, these observations have not been verified empirically, nor has the psychophysiological basis of eye avoidance been examined. This is the first study to use an objective psychophysiological marker of visual attention (the visual scanpath) to examine directly how social phobia subjects process interpersonal (facial expression) stimuli. An infra-red corneal reflection technique was used to record visual scanpaths in response to neutral, happy and sad face stimuli in 15 subjects with social phobia, and 15 age and sex-matched normal controls. The social phobia subjects showed an avoidance of facial features, particularly the eyes, but extensive scanning of non-features, compared with the controls. These findings suggest that attentional strategies for the active avoidance of salient facial features are an important marker of interpersonal cues in social phobia. Visual scanpath evidence may, therefore, have important implications for clinical intervention. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Isolation from predators affects prey behavior, morphology, and life history, but there is tremendous variation in the time course of these responses. Previous hypotheses to explain this variation have limited predictive ability. I develop a 'multipredator' hypothesis to explain the evolutionary persistence of antipredator behavior after the loss of some, but not all, of a species' predators. The hypothesis assumes pleiotropy, whereby elements of antipredator behavior may function in non-predatory situations, and linkage, such that genes influencing the expression of antipredator behavior do not assort independently. The hypothesis is restricted to species with multiple predators (most species) and aims to predict the conditions under which antipredator behavior will persist following the loss of one or more of a species' predators. I acknowledge that the relative costs of non-functional antipredator behavior will influence the likelihood of linkage and therefore persistence. The hypothesis makes two main predictions. First, genes responsible for antipredator behavior will not be scattered throughout the genome but rather may be found close together on the same chromosome(s). Secondly, the presence of any predators may be sufficient to maintain antipredator behavior for missing predators. Advances in behavioral genetics will allow tests of the first prediction, while studies of geographic variation in antipredator behavior provide some support for the second. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.

AB  - Animals possess a range of defensive markings to reduce the risk of predation, including warning colours, camouflage, eyespots and mimicry. These different strategies are frequently considered independently, and with little regard towards predator vision, even though they may be linked in various ways and can be fully understood only in terms of predator perception. For example, camouflage and warning coloration need not be mutually exclusive, and may frequently exploit similar features of visual perception. This paper outlines how different forms of protective markings can be understood from predator perception and illustrates how this is fundamental in determining the mechanisms underlying, and the interrelation between, different strategies. Suggestions are made for future work, and potential mechanisms discussed in relation to various forms of defensive coloration, including disruptive coloration, eyespots, dazzle markings, motion camouflage, aposematism and mimicry. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - The colour vision of domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) was investigated by training them to small food containers decorated with tilings of grey and coloured rectangles. Chicks learn to recognise the colour quickly and accurately. Chicks have four types of single-cone photoreceptor sensitive to ultraviolet, short-, medium- or long-wavelength light. To establish how these receptors are used for colour vision, stimuli were designed to be distinguished only by specific combinations of receptors. We infer (1) that all four single cones are used, and (2) that their outputs are encoded by at least three opponency mechanisms: one comparing the outputs of ultraviolet- and short-wavelength-sensitive receptors, one comparing the outputs of medium- and long-wavelength receptors and a third comparing of the outputs of short- and long- and/or medium-wavelength receptors. Thus, the chicks have tetrachromatic colour vision. These experiments do not exclude a role for the fifth cone type, double cones, but other evidence suggests that these cones serve luminance-based tasks, such as motion detection, and not colour recognition.

AB  - 1. Lepidoptera belonging to several different families bear eyespot patterns on their wings, often with a very strong resemblance to the vertebrate eye. These have been derived from different morphological structures in different groups, and their evolution is therefore convergent within the order. 2. A study of two individual hand-reared Yellow Buntings has shown that the pursuit of flying insect prey is fully released at the bird's first encounter with a flying butterfly, but that the orientation of the attack is modified by experience. 3. Eyespot patterns are associated with displays which exhibit them. In the case of a Nymphalid butterfly, Nymphalis io, an experiment has shown that the display releases escape responses from Yellow Buntings, and that the major part of this effect is due to the four ocelli on the upper surface of the fore- and hind wings. Experiments with other species of insects suggest that other factors contributing include the bright field of colour surrounding the eyespots, the rhythmic movements of the display, and the rustling noise which accompanies it. The bird's responses to this display waned rapidly in the majority of individuals, but some birds became conditioned to avoid the butterflies altogether. 4. Experiments with models showed that circular patterns presented suddenly to feeding birds (Chaffinches, Yellow Buntings and Great Tits) release escape responses more effectively than do non-circular patterns of the same area and perimeter. An increase in the perimeter of the models, achieved by the use of three concentric circles of the same area as the single circle, increased its releasing value. A flat, eye-like pattern which was so shaded and distorted as to appear three-dimensional was more effective than a similar flat pattern which was not shaded, and hence was more bright. Large models were more effective than similar small ones. Waning was again rapid. The differential responsiveness to circular and non-circular patterns is inborn in the case of Great Tits and Chaffinches. 5. An experiment with mealworms artifically ornamented with small eye-like spots at their extremities has shown that such markings, placed on a prey-object, tend to direct to themselves the attack of Yellow Buntings. The waning of the element of disturbed orientation in the responses is slow, and may not be significant. 6. The deflection and intimidation effects are discussed. The origin of the predator's responses to deflection marks is not known, but it is suggested that intimidating eyespots act by mimicking the eyes of the large avian predators preying on the small insectivorous passerines which are among their natural enemies. It has been shown that many small passerines possess inborn responses to their predators, and it is probable that these are "parasitised" by the eyespot patterns of insects. Eyespot patterns must be regarded as wholly distinct from pseudaposematic colouration. The effect of experience on small passerines, either of the predator-model or of an ocellated imitator, is most usually the reverse of that sustained by a predator encountering the model or mimic in a true case of Batesian or Mullerian mimicry, and the restrictions on the population size of a pseudaposematic insect relative to its model do not apply to insects utilising the inborn responses of their predators.

AB  - Background: The perceived color at each point in a visual scene depends on the relationship between light signals from that point, and light signals from surrounding areas of the scene. In the well known phenomenon of simultaneous color contrast, changing the overall brightness or hue of an object's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived brightness or hue of the object's color. Color contrast is thought to contribute to color constancy with changes in illumination. Results: We report a new type of simultaneous color contrast, in which changing only the variance (i.e. contrasts and saturations), but not the mean, of colors in a test spot's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived contrast and saturation of the test spot's color. Objects appear much more vivid and richly colored against low-contrast, gray surrounds than against high-contrast, multicolored surrounds. Conclusions: Color appearance depends not just on the mean color of the surround, but also on the distribution of surround colors about the mean. This novel form of simultaneous color contrast is inconsistent with a variety of models of color appearance, including those based on sensitivity regulation at the receptor level, and those in which the effects of complex surrounds on color appearance can be reduced to adaptation to the illuminant or induction from a homogeneous 'equivalent surround'. It tends to normalize the gamut of perceived colors in each visual scone and may also contribute to color constancy under viewing conditions that affect contrast.

AB  - Eyespots are found in a variety of animals, in particular lepidopterans. The role of eyespots as antipredator mechanisms has been discussed since the 19th Century, with two main hypotheses invoked to explain their occurrence. The first is that large, centrally located eyespots intimidate predators by resembling the eyes of the predators' own enemies; the second, though not necessarily conflicting, hypothesis is that small, peripherally located eyespots function as markers to deflect the attacks of predators to non-vital regions of the body. A third possibility is also proposed; that eyespots intimidate predators merely because they are novel or rarely encountered salient features. These hypotheses are reviewed, with special reference given to avian predators, since these are likely to be the principal visually hunting predators of the lepidopterans considered. Also highlighted is the necessity to consider the potential influence of sexual selection on lepidopteran wing patterns, and the genetics and development of eyespot formation. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - EVOLUTIONARY studies are hampered by a lack of experimental ways in which to test past events such as the origination of aposematism, whereby unpalatable or poisonous prey signal their unprofitability, often by being warningly coloured. Inexperienced predators do learn to avoid unpalatable prey as a result of such signals, but in addition there may be an inherited cautiousness about attacking when common or conspicuous warning signals are evident. As current predators are not naive in the evolutionary sense, it is still not resolved whether aposematism originated only in aggregations of prey or among solitary prey as well. Here we explore this controversy in evolutionary naive predators by creating a novel world with warning signals not found in the environment. Initially, the aggregation of prey favoured the warning signals supporting Fisher's view of kin aggregations us the evolutionary starting point of aposematism. However, once predators had experienced warning signals, pre-existing avoidance seemed to facilitate evolution of Mullerian mimicry complexes with similar types of signals even among solitary prey.

AB  - When a predator attacks, prey are faced with a series of 'if', 'when' and 'how' escape decisions - these critical questions are the foci of this book. Cooper and Blumstein bring together a balance of theory and empirical research to summarise over fifty years of scattered research and benchmark current thinking in the rapidly expanding literature on the behavioural ecology of escaping. The book consolidates current and new behaviour models with taxonomically divided empirical chapters that demonstrate the application of escape theory to different groups. The chapters integrate behaviour with physiology, genetics and evolution to lead the reader through the complex decisions faced by prey during a predator attack, examining how these decisions interact with life history and individual variation. The chapter on best practice field methodology and the ideas for future research presented throughout, ensure this volume is practical as well as informative. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - Sexual and natural selection pressures are thought to shape the characteristic wing patterns of butterfly species. Here we test whether sexual selection by female choice plays a role in the maintenance of the male wing pattern in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We perform one of the most extensive series of wing pattern manipulations in butterflies, dissecting every component of the 'bulls-eye' eyespot patterns in both ventral and dorsal wing surfaces of males to test the trait's appeal to females. We conclude that females select males on the basis of the size and brightness of the dorsal eyespot's ultraviolet reflecting pupils. Pupil absence is strongly selected against, as are artificially enlarged pupils. Small to intermediate (normal sized) pupils seem to function equally well. This work contradicts earlier experiments that suggest that the size of dorsal eyespots plays a role in female choice and explains why male dorsal eyespots are very variable in size and often have indistinct rings of coloration, as the only feature under selection by females seems to be the central white pupil. We propose that sexual selection by female choice, rather than predator avoidance, may have been an important selective factor in the early stages of eyespot evolution in ancestral Lepidopteran lineages. © 2005 The Royal Society.

AB  - One cannot help being impressed by the near-perfect camouflage of a moth matching the colour and pattern of the tree on which it rests, or of the many examples in nature of animals resembling other objects in order to be hidden (Figure 1.1). The Nobel Prize winning ethologist Niko Tinbergen referred to such moths as ‘bark with wings’ (Tinbergen 1974), such was the impressiveness of their camouflage. On a basic level, camouflage can be thought of as the property of an object that renders it difficult to detect or recognise by virtue of its similarity to its environment (Stevens & Merilaita 2009a). The advantage of being concealed from predators (or sometimes from prey) is easy to understand, and camouflage has long been used as a classical example of natural selection. Perhaps for this reason, until recently, camouflage was subject to little rigorous experimentation – its function and value seemed obvious. However, like any theory, the possible advantages of camouflage, and how it works, need rigorous scientific testing. Furthermore, as we shall see below and in this book in general, the concept of concealment is much richer, more complex and interesting than scientists originally thought. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - Attention is drawn to the widespread occurrence of protean phenomena, in which the appearance and behaviour of prey animals are rendered variable and irregular, as a weapon in the biological arms race between predators and their prey. Protean behaviour is defined as that behaviour which is sufficiently unsystematic to prevent a reactor predicting in detail the position or actions of the actor. Single prey animals frequently flee from a predator in an irregular manner, zigzagging, spinning, looping, or bouncing. This single erratic display occurs widely in the Animal Kingdom, and may also be utilised in everyday movements of potential prey as insurance against possible attack. Examples are given. In a group of prey animals the protean aspect of escape is enhanced by the effect of numbers. In scatter reactions the effect is of multiple choice and of the simultaneous operation of several single erratics. In mobbing displays there are also successive changes in the actors' behavioural role. In protean deterrence the shuffling of individuals within a tightly packed group prevents a predator from singling one out for attack. In many species the confusing effect of changes in movement and behavioural role is enhanced by rapid changes in appearance, particularly colour. It is suggested that those prey individuals which employ escape patterns unfamiliar to the predator will tend to be at a selective advantage. During phylogeny this is likely to lead to intra-specific and inter-specific increase in the number and diversity of escape behaviours. Apostatic polymorphism is seen as a special case of protean variation within populations. There is evidence that protean displays operate by arousing neurological conflict, thereby delaying the predator's reactions and reducing the effectiveness of predatory mechanisms. Also they insure against learned countermeasures by incorporating irregularities as a basic principle. It is stressed that the irregular variability of protean displays is not accidental but has been selected for in phylogeny. A number of poorly understood behavioural aspects of the ecology of predator-prey relationships are thus united in a single theory. © 1970 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Color patterns on lepidopteran wings are believed to be organized around a series of hypothetical foci. Foci presumably serve as sources of positional information, directing synthesis of appropriate pigments in their vicinity. Species-specific color patterns arise by variations in the number of foci on the wing and variations in the rules by which positional information is interpreted. The present paper provides experimental evidence for the existence of a focus that determines the large eyespot on the forewing of the Buckeye butterfly,Precis coenia. Cautery of a small group of about 300 cells at the center of the presumptive eyespot, early during wing development, can completely inhibit development of the eyespot. The same group of cells can be transplanted to another region of the wing and induce ring-shaped pigment patterns in the host tissue around the graft. These findings show that a focus is a physiological entity. Color pattern induction is an intrinsic property of a small group of cells. Presumably these cells produce a factor that affects the production of enzymes involved in pigment synthesis. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Examples of imperfect resemblance between Batesian mimics and their models appear widespread in the natural world, but so far few quantitative models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. I used a simple signal detection model to show that the relationship between model-mimic similarity and mimic effectiveness is typically nonlinear. In particular, I found that there will be little or no further selection to improve model-mimic resemblance beyond a certain level if the model species is costly to attack, if the mimic species is not particularly profitable (e.g., hard to catch), or if the mimic is relatively rare. When there are two different sympatric model species, then mimics should usually evolve a phenotypic similarity to one or the other model species, but not to both. In contrast, when several model species occur in different areas (or emerge at different times) and individual mimics use each of these areas, then the optimal phenotype should be a "jack-of-all-trades" intermediate phenotype that does not closely resemble any particular model species. Somewhat surprisingly, the theory predicts that if mimics spend an equal amount of time with each model species, then the optimal intermediate phenotype should more closely resemble the least numerous and least noxious model. This phenomenon arises because a vague similarity to an extremely noxious species is usually sufficient to guarantee significant protection, whereas a much closer resemblance to a mildly noxious model species is necessary to afford a similar level of benefit.

AB  - Though it has long been known that animal communication is complex, recent years have seen growing interest in understanding the extent to which animals give multicomponent signals in multiple modalities, and how the different types of information extracted by receivers are interpreted and integrated in animal decision-making. This interest has culminated in the production of the present special issue on multimodal communication, which features both theoretical and empirical studies from leading researchers in the field. Reviews, comparative analyses, and species-specific empirical studies include manuscripts on taxa as diverse as spiders, primates, birds, lizards, frogs, and humans. The present manuscript serves as both an introduction to this special issue, as well as an introduction to multimodal communication more generally. We discuss the history of the study of complexity in animal communication, issues relating to defining and classifying multimodal signals, and particular issues to consider with multimodal (as opposed to multicomponent unimodal) communication. We go on to discuss the current state of the field, and outline the contributions contained within the issue. We finish by discussing future avenues for research, in particular emphasizing that 'multimodal' is more than just 'bimodal', and that more integrative frameworks are needed that incorporate more elements of efficacy, such as receiver sensory ecology and the environment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Many fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and some mammals use UV vision for such basic activities as foraging, mate selection, and communication. UV vision is mediated by UV pigments in the short wavelength-sensitive type 1 (SWS1) group that absorb light maximally (λmax) at ≈360 nm. Reconstructed SWS1 pigments of most vertebrate ancestors have λmax values of ≈360 nm, whereas the ancestral avian pigment has a Amax value of 393 nm. In the nonavian lineage, UV vision in many modern species is inherited directly from the vertebrate ancestor, whereas violet vision in others has evolved by different amino acid replacements at ≈10 specific sites. In the avian lineage, the origin of the violet pigment and the subsequent restoration of UV pigments in some species are caused by amino acid replacements F49V/F86S/L116V/S118A and S90C, respectively. The use of UV vision is associated strongly with UV-dependent behaviors of organisms. When UV light is not available or is unimportant to organisms, the SWS1 gene can become nonfunctional, as exemplified by coelacanth and dolphin.

AB  - Avoiding the strike of an approaching predator requires rapid visual detection of a looming object, followed by a directed escape maneuver. While looming-sensitive neurons have been discovered in various animal species, the relative importance of stimulus features that are extracted by the visual system is still unclear. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms that compute object approach are largely unknown. We found that a virtual looming stimulus, i.e., a dark expanding disk on a bright background, reliably evoked rapid escape movements. Related stimuli, such as dimming, receding, or bright looming objects, were substantially less effective, and angular size was a critical determinant of escape initiation. Two-photon calcium imaging in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons revealed three retinorecipient areas that responded robustly to looming stimuli. One of these areas, the optic tectum, is innervated by a subset of RGC axons that respond selectively to looming stimuli. Laser-induced lesions of the tectal neuropil impaired the behavior. Our findings demonstrate a visually mediated escape behavior in zebrafish larvae exposed to objects approaching on a collision course. This response is sensitive to spatiotemporal parameters of the looming stimulus. Our data indicate that a subset of RGC axons within the tectum responds selectively to features of looming stimuli and that this input is necessary for visually evoked escape. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana exhibits phenotypic plasticity involving the wet-season phenotype, which possesses marginal eyespots on the ventral surface of the wings, and the dry-season form, which lacks these eyespots. We examined the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity of B. anynana in relation to the defence mechanisms of crypsis and deflection. We assessed the visibility differences between spotless and spotted butterflies against backgrounds of brown (dry season) or green (wet season) leaves. Spotless butterflies were highly cryptic and less predated by adult bird predators than were spotted ones when presented against brown leaf litter. However, the advantage of crypsis disappeared in the wet-season habitat as both forms were equally visible. In later experiments, naive birds presented with resting butterflies in the wet-season habitat tended to learn more rapidly to capture spotless butterflies, suggesting a slight selective advantage of possessing eyespots. Moreover, marginal eyespots increased significantly the escape probability of butterflies that were attacked by naive birds compared to those attacked by adult birds, although there were no differences in prey capture success within naive predators. Our results show that natural selection acts against eyespots in the dry season, favouring crypsis, whereas in the wet season it may favour eyespots as deflective patterns.

AB  - Despite the dearth of field-based evidence from natural model-mimic communities, theory suggests that Batesian mimicry should have limits placed upon the model: mimic ratio for mimics to benefit. Paradoxically, hoverflies that are apparently mimics are often superabundant, many times more abundant than their supposed models. One possible solution to this paradox is that perhaps they are not mimics at all. We use discriminative operant conditioning methods to measure the similarity perceived by pigeons between wasps and various species of supposedly mimetic hoverflies, and an image processing technique to measure objective similarity. We demonstrate that pigeons rank mimics according to their similarity to a wasp model, in an orderly broadly similar to our own intuitive rankings. Thus pigeons behave as if many hoverflies are indeed wasp mimics. However, they rank the two commonest hoverflies as very similar to wasps, despite these looking decidedly poor mimics to the human eye. In these species, 'poor' mimicry may have been sustainable because it exploits some constraint in birds' visual or learning mechanisms, or some key feature used in pattern recognition. Furthermore, the relation between similarity and mimicry is nonlinear: small changes in similarity can lead to dramatic increases in the degree of mimicry.

AB  - The visual receptors in the retina of the passeriform bird Leiothrix lutea were examined microspectro-photometrically. The rods had a maximum absorbance close to 500 nm. Four spectrally different classes of single cone were identified with typical combinations of photopigments and oil droplets: a long-wave sensitive cone with a photopigment P568 and a droplet with a cut-off wavelength at 564 nm, a middle-wave sensitive cone with a P499 and a droplet with a cut-off at 506 nm, a short-wave sensitive cone with a P454 and a droplet with maximum absorbance below 410nm and an ultraviolet sensitive cone with a P355 and a transparent droplet. Double cones possessed a P568 in both the principal and accessory members. A pale droplet with variable absorbance (maximal at about 420 nm) was associated with the principal member whereas the ellipsoid region of the accessory member contained only low concentrations of carotenoid. The effective spectral sensitivities of the different cone classes were calculated from the characteristic combinations of oil droplets and photopigments and corrected for the absorbance of the ocular media. Comparison of these results with the behavioural spectral sensitivity function of Leiothrix lutea suggests that the increment threshold photopic spectral sensitivity of this avian species is mediated by the 4 single cone classes modified by neural opponent mechanisms. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Experiments with fish and birds suggest that animals are unable to simultaneously allocate sufficient attention to tasks such as the detection of an approaching predator while searching for cryptic prey. We quantified the effects of limited attention on performance in controlled laboratory settings and report here the first direct evidence that attending to a difficult central task simulating foraging deters a bird's ability to detect a peripheral target, which could be a predator. Our results fill a gap between ecological and neurobiological studies by illustrating that, although attention is an efficient filtering mechanism, limited attention may be a major cause of mortality in nature.

AB  - Among the many Batesian mimetic hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) some have a very precise resemblance to the presumed model ('good' or 'specific' mimics) while others have a much less precise resemblance ('poor' or 'general' mimics). Intuitively one might expect that the specific mimics would be commoner and more successful than the general mimics. However, many specific mimics (e.g. Sericomyia silentis, Volucella bombylans) are quite rare, while general mimics are common (e.g. Syrphus ribesii, Episyrphus balteatus and Eristalis intricarius). Similarly, some ant-mimicking spiders from several different families are very good morphological and behavioural mimics of just one species of ant while others have a less detailed resemblance to ants in general. Six hypotheses are presented to explain the occurrence of so many poor mimics, and a theoretical model is outlined (the multi-model hypothesis) which shows how a poor general mimic can have a larger population than a good, specific mimic. This hypothesis may apply to some species of hoverfly and to some ant-mimicking spiders. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - The list of visible features that supply the basis of body patterning in Octopus vulgaris is classified into chromatic, postural or movement components. (Their number is limited, variety in the expression of complete patterns being achieved by variation in intensity and spatial extent of components). Dark and light components are based upon chromatic units consistent with the patchwork structure of the skin. The pigmented and reflecting elements (chromatophores, iridocytes, leucophores) of these units express themselves in groups often with high tone contrast. A cryptic pattern, the flamboyant, appears in early settling stages as a generalized response to disturbance, both to a new environment and to the approach of threatening shapes (rubber bungs). In test observations on twelve animals divided into three body weight groups (<1 g, 1 to 5 g and 5 to 25 g) the flamboyant declines in incidence with increasing body size and is replaced by the dymantic as a specific response to threatening shapes. © 1971.

AB  - Investigating the relative importance of multiple cues for mate choice within a species may highlight possible mechanisms that led to the diversification of closely related species in the past. Here, we investigate the importance of close-range pheromones produced by male Bicyclus anynana butterflies and determine the relative importance of these chemical cues versus visual cues in sexual selection by female choice. We first blocked putative androconial organs on the fore- and hindwings of males, while also manipulating the ability of females to perceive chemical signals via their antenna. We found that male chemical signals were emitted by both fore- and hindwing pairs and that they play an important role in female choice. We subsequently tested the relative importance of these chemical cues versus visual cues, previously identified for this species, and found that they play an equally important role in female choice in our laboratory setting. In addition, females will mate with males with only one signal present and blocking both androconial organs on males seems to interfere with male to male recognition. We discuss the possible functions of these signals and how this bimodal system may be used in intra- and interspecific mate evaluation. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - Birds show distinct hesitation when approaching novel food and this has been termed 'neophobia'. In laboratory-held birds like domestic chicks this effect lasts for a matter of a few minutes at most, but hesitant attack of novel foods can last for weeks or even months in wild birds. This effect, called 'dietary conservatism', seems to be a different type of learning process from neophobia as first described and has hitherto been largely overlooked. This paper presents some evidence for the view that the processes may be fundamentally different. We outline results from laboratory chicks that show neophobia to he easily deactivated by experience, which renders it unlikely to be an important force in wild birds. We also report evidence that the process of incorporation of novel food into the diet is not a simple one-stage process but includes at least four steps of assessment. The paper concludes with an outline of the importance of dietary conservatism in our understanding of the evolution of aposematism and the workings of mimicry.

AB  - The spectral sensitivity of 15 species of birds has been measured by recording transretinal voltages from opened eyecups. With suitable combinations of colored adapting lights, we find that a variety of passerines have four peaks of photopic sensitivity, with maxima at 370, 450, 480, and 570 nm. Additional sensitivity maxima at 510 nm are found in some species. The spectral sensitivity functions are not altered by bathing the retinas in 50 m M sodium aspartate, suggesting that they reflect the properties of cones and do not result from inhibitory interactions between retinal interneurons. Comparison of the results with a general mathematical model that describes spectral sensitivity functions recorded extracellularly from populations of receptors in different states of adaptation (Goldsmith 1986) shows that the retinal spectral sensitivity functions are consistent with the presence of (at least) four types of cone, but indicate as well that many of the cones that are maximally sensitive in the blue and violet likely contain oil droplets that attenuate the deep violet and near uv. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - An explanation is developed for the adaptive significance of the forms characteristic of the dry season and wet season adult generations of some tropical butterflies. The divergent phenotypes are accounted for as adaptive responses to a shift in the optimum balance between dependence on the alternative (but interdependent) strategies of active anti‐predator devices and of crypsis. The seasonal polyphenisms exhibited by the satyrines Melanitis leda (Fabricius) and Orsotrioena medus (Fabricius) and the nymphalid Junonia almana (Linné) are examined in detail. The wet season forms show prominent marginal eyespot patterns which are displayed at rest and function principally in the deflection of attacks by vertebrate predators. In contrast, the dry season forms show very small or no spots and are wholly cryptic. Wet season butterflies are more active in general than those in the dry season when aestivation behaviour is often observed. The alternative phenotypes represent responses to the differences in behaviour, environment and nature of predation. Reproductive success is optimized in each season by an interaction of phenotype and behaviour. The hypothesis must be tested in detail by an investigation of the behavioural ecology and population biology of particular species. It is argued that these seasonal polyphenisms provide examples of adaptations to a repeating pattern of changing environments where the mode of selection is, in broad terms, understood.

AB  - Multimodal warning displays combine visual signals with components produced in other sensory modalities, for instance, aposematically coloured insects often produce a pungent odour or harsh sound when they are attacked. Recent research has focussed upon a particular odour, pyrazine, which is commonly associated with warning coloration. Our experiments have shown that pyrazine elicits hidden unlearned biases against particular visual aspects of food in foraging domestic chicks. Here we asses the current state of our knowledge about these biases, reviewing our results using pyrazine and other odours, and also presenting new data showing that sound can produce similar effects. We will discuss potential psychological mechanisms by which these foraging biases are achieved in avian predators, and potential pathways for their evolution.

AB  - Long-lived butterflies that hibernate as adults are expected to have well-developed antipredation devices as a result of their long exposure to natural enemies. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, for instance, is a cryptic leaf mimic when resting, but shifts to active defence when disturbed, performing a repeated sequence of movements exposing major eyespots on the wings accompanied by a hissing noise. We studied the effect of visual and auditory defence by staging experiments in which wild-caught blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were presented with one of six kinds of experimentally manipulated living peacock butterflies as follows: butterflies with eyespots painted over and their controls (painted on another part of the wing), butterflies with their sound production aborted (small part of wings removed) and their controls, and butterflies with eyespots painted over and sound production aborted and their controls. The results showed that eyespots alone, or in combination with sound, constituted an effective defence; only 1 out of 34 butterflies with intact eyespots was killed, whereas 13 out of 20 butterflies without eyespots were killed. The killed peacocks were eaten, indicating that they are not distasteful. Hence, intimidation by bluffing can be an efficient means of defence for an edible prey. © 2005 The Royal Society.

AB  - In butterflies there is a class of "intervein" wing patterns that have lines of symmetry halfway between wing veins. These patterns occur in a range of shapes, including eyespots, ellipses, and midlines, and were proposed to have evolved through developmental shifts along a midline-to-eyespot continuum. Here we show that Notch (N) upregulation, followed by activation of the transcription factor Distal-less (Dll), is an early event in the development of eyespot and intervein midline patterns across multiple species of butterflies. A relationship between eyespot phenotype and N and Dll expression is demonstrated in a loss-of-eyespot mutant in which N and Dll expression is reduced at missing eyespot sites. A phylogenetic comparison of expression time series from eight moth and butterfly species suggests that intervein N and Dll patterns are a derived characteristic of the butterfly lineage. Furthermore, prior to eyespot determination in eyespot-bearing butterflies, N and Dll are transiently expressed in a pattern that resembles ancestral intervein midline patterns. In this study we establish N upregulation as the earliest known event in eyespot determination, demonstrate gene expression associated with intervein midline color patterns, and provide molecular evidence that wing patterns evolved through addition to and truncation of a conserved midline-to-eyespot pattern formation sequence.

AB  - The colour patterns decorating butterfly wings provide ideal material to study the reciprocal interactions between evolution and development. They are visually compelling products of selection, often with a clear adaptive value, and are amenable to a detailed developmental characterization. Research on wing-pattern evolution and development has focused on the eyespots of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. There is quantitative variation for several features of eyespot morphology but the actual genes contributing to such variation are unknown. On the other hand, studies of gene expression patterns in wing primordia have implicated different developmental pathways in eyespot formation. To link these two sets of information we need to identify which genes within the implicated pathways contribute to the quantitative variation accessible to natural selection. Here we begin to bridge this gap by demonstrating linkage between DNA polymorphisms in the candidate gene Distal-less (D11) and eyespot size in B. anynana.

AB  - Information about colour is initially extracted by the visual system in terms of the activity within a small number of receptor types with different spectral sensitivities, and then recoded within channels that respond to different combinations of the receptor signals. Many insights have been gained about these post-receptoral transformations, yet their number and nature remain poorly defined. This review examines how the signals coding colour are organized within the human visual system, and how these signals are affected by the processes of adaptation. Sensitivity is controlled by two distinct classes of adaptation that adjust to different aspects of the stimulus; retinal mechanisms of light adaptation adjust for changes in the average colour across scenes, while cortical mechanisms of contrast adaptation adjust for changes in the distribution of colours. Together these exert a profound and pervasive influence on our colour perception. © 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The eyes of 15 species of birds from 10 families have some cones maximally sensitive at 370 nanometers in the near-ultraviolet. Spectral sensitivity was measured by recording extracellularly in opened eyecups, and a maximum in the ultraviolet was revealed by selectively adapting the retina with yellow background lights. The 370-nanometer spectral sensitivity function is attributed to receptors because its spectral position does not vary with the strength of adaptation and because it is present when the receptor potentials are isolated from the contributions of higher order retinal neurons by exposing the retina to sodium aspartate. These measurements demonstrate the basis for the ultraviolet sensitivity of birds that has been seen in behavioral experiments, and they provide further evidence that many vertebrates share with insects vision in the near-ultraviolet.

AB  - 1. Many insects stridulate when they are handled or attacked. It has been suggested that this disturbance stridulation acts to deter predators. This hypothesis was investigated in a series of experiments. Predators were given insects which had been silenced by disruption of their sound-producing mechanism or else had been sham operated but retained their normal ability to stridulate. 2. Three types of insects (mutillid wasps, Dasymutilla spp.; water scavenger beetles, Tropisternus spp.; and round sand beetles, Omophron labiatus) were given to wolf spiders (Lycosa ceratiola and Geolycosa ornatipes) at night in the field under natural conditions. When attacking silenced insects, spiders displayed greater persistence than when attacking phonic insects (Table 1). In addition, mortality was greater among silenced insects. 3. Spiders (L. ceratiola) were also given an artificial 'insect'-a vibrating probe whose vibration mimicked that of the cuticle of a stridulating insect. As with real insects, spiders persisted longer in their attack on the probe when it was silent than when it was 'stridulating". 4. Female mutillid wasps were given to wild-caught mice (Peromyscus floridanus) in the laboratory. Unsilenced mutillids survived the encounter more often than their silenced counterparts. In another experiment, the stings of mutillid wasps were removed before testing. Mice killed nearly all these 'unprotected' mutillids. However, it took mice significantly longer to attack unsilenced mutillids and longer to kill them after initiating the assault (Table 2). 5. These results support the view that insect disturbance stridulation deters predators. Two modes of action by which these sounds may have their effect are discussed: they may serve to startle the attacker or they may alert it to the potential harmfulness of the insect and as such may qualify as an example of acoustic aposematism. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Recently there has been debate over the importance of innate avoidance of aposematic prey by predators, particularly birds. There is evidence that the predators have innate or unlearned, thus, inherited avoidance against certain colors, but whether there is any innate avoidance against gregariousness or conspicuousness is unclear. Previously predator behavior toward these characters of aposematic prey have been tested in separate experiments. We designed an experiment to separate inheritance toward color, gregariousness, and conspicuosness. We simultaneously offered the predators warningly colored and nonwarningly colored prey items, both aggregated and solitary, on white (conspicuous) or brown (cryptic) backgrounds. The predators we used were naive (hand raised), wild-caught yearling and adult great tits (Parus major L.). The results confirm previous results regarding the innate avoidance of color. Naive predators seemed to have a genetically or culturally transmitted avoidance of yellow and black prey compared to brown prey. Surprisingly, yearling wild-caught great tits were more selective than adults, which did not show as strong avoidance of yellow and black prey. More importantly, birds did not find gregarious prey more aversive than single prey, which indicates that grouping alone does not serve as an innate avoidance signal. Conspicuousness itself was not aversive to the predators. Our results suggest that the avoidance against a particular color pattern probably has an inherited basis, whereas gregarious and conspicuous characters of prey presumably aid the avoidance learning.

AB  - Current explanations for why sexual ornaments are found in both sexes include genetic correlation, same sex competition, and mutual mate choice. In this study, we report developmental plasticity in mating behavior as induced by temperature during development in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Males and females reciprocally change their sexual roles depending on their larval rearing temperatures. This switch is correlated with a change in mating benefits to females and costs to males. The discrete seasonal environments, wet season and dry season, are known to produce the two developmental forms and as a consequence impose alternating, symmetrical patterns of sexual selection, one season on male ornaments, the following season on female ornaments. Thus, reciprocal selection through time may result in mutual sexual ornamentation.

AB  - At low air temperatures most individuals bask on rides, open areas with high basking site temperatures. With increasing air temperature individuals are sunlit patches within woodland as basking sites, areas with basking site temperatures which are lower than on rides. Individuals alternate between basking and flying but spend longer periods in flight when air temperatures are highest. Mate locating strategies of males alternate between perching and patrolling, and are not as rigid as previously suggested. Patrolling males locate females at a faster rate than perched males but flights are restricted by the necessity to maintain high body temperatures. After periods of basking, thoracic temperatures are in the range 32-34.5oC but flight causes a significant decrease in body temperature.-from Author

AB  - Three species of hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri, Lampornis clemenciae, and Eugenes fulgens) were trained to make visual discriminations between lights of different spectral content. On the basis of initial choices of feeders following a period of conditioning, birds of all three species were able to distinguish near ultraviolet (370 nanometers, 20-nanometer half bandwidth) from darkness (unilluminated viewing screen) or from the small amount of far red light that leaked through the ultraviolet-transmitting glass filter. A human observer was unable to make either discrimination. The birds were also able to distinguish white lights lacking wavelengths shorter than 400 nanometers from the full spectrum of the quartz-halogen bulbs. One can infer that the cone oil droplets, which have been lost from the retinas of most mammals, provide a potentially more flexible system for restricting the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum than does the filtering action of lens and macula that serves this function in the human eye.

AB  - Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals. © The Author 2008.

AB  - Several neo-tropical butterfly species were presented to 171 wild-caught adult Blue Jays to determine if insects of unfamiliar color pattern would elicit an attack response from an avian predator regardless of the visual characteristics of the prey. It was found that unfamiliar insects do not always elicit an attack response. Four aspects of the birds' behaviors were noted: 1) the initial responses to various training diets were different; 2) the training diets had a direct effect on the reactions of the birds to new insects; 3) there was a difference in the attack responses of the birds to different novel insects; 4) there was an interaction between training diets and novel insects. Four aspects of avian feeding behavior were discussed as possible explanations of the results: preference for familiar food, generalization from previous experience, innate avoidance of specific stimuli, and innate avoidance of novel stimuli.

AB  - Empirical findings suggest that the mammalian brain has two decision-making systems that act at different speeds. We represent the faster system using standard signal detection theory. We represent the slower (but more accurate) cortical system as the integration of sensory evidence over time until a certain level of confidence is reached. We then consider how two such systems should be combined optimally for a range of information linkage mechanisms. We conclude with some performance predictions that will hold if our representation is realistic. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - This paper presents an attempt to construct a single model that can account for pattern formation in a very broad diversity of Lepidoptera. A pattern database is developed for 330 genera and 2208 species in the family Nymphalidae. It is argued that because of the close taxonomic relation between these species, and that all have patterns that are readily derived from the homology system known as the nymphalid ground-plan, the whole diversity of patterns in the database should emerge from a single model mechanism, and that most of this diversity should emerge from simple quantitative variations of the parameters of the model. A formal list of desiderata and constraints on any model for colour pattern formation is developed and used as the basis for the present modelling effort. Based on the assumptions of simple diffusion and threshold mechanisms, a pattern of source-sink distributions is deduced that can generate the diversity of patterns in the database. The adequacy of this source-sink 'toolbox' is tested by computer simulation; it is shown that a two-gradient model with a simple additive relation between the two gradients suffices to generate nearly the entire diversity of patterns observed. The requisite positions of the sources and sinks of the toolbox, in turn, emerge readily from Meinhardt's lateral inhibition model for reaction diffusion. Thus a two step model, consisting first of a reaction-diffusion system that sets up a source-sink pattern and is followed by simple diffusion of a morphogen from those sources, appears to be able to generate nearly the entire diversity of colour patterns seen in the Nymphalidae.

AB  - Vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park, Kenya are preyed upon by four types of predator: mammalian carnivores, eagles, baboons, and snakes. Over a 14 month period, adult males and females gave first alarm calls at comparable rates. Both observation on the frequency of alarm-calling and experiments on the duration of alarm-calling indicated that high-ranking adult males and females gave alarm calls more often than low-ranking adult males and females. Individuals who alarm-called most often did not vocalize most often during social interactions, nor did they spend more time than others surveying the habitat around them. There was some tendency, however, for females who alarm-called most often to precede other females in group progressions. Limited evidence suggests that adult males who gave most alarm calls were more likely than other males to have fathered the group’s juveniles and infants. Among adult females, however, there was no correlation between number of offspring and frequency of first alarm calls. Females who gave alarm calls most often were not more likely than other females to spend large proportions of observation time more than 2 m from their offspring. Data on a small sample of confirmed predatory attacks suggest that the offspring of high-ranking females may have been more vulnerable than other immatures to prédation. Such differential vulnerability may have resulted in part from the tendency of the offspring of high-ranking females to precede other juveniles in group progressions. Vervets of all age/sex classes alarm-called most at those species of predators to which they themselves seemed to be most vulnerable. Adult vervets gave relatively few alarm calls to predators to which their offspring, but not themselves, were vulnerable, even though such alarm calls would have been of low cost to themselves and of great potential benefit to their offspring. While some aspects of the alarm-calling behavior of vervet monkeys are consistent with the hypothesis that their alarms have evolved to benefit kin, in other respects their alarms appear to have the consequence of benefitting only the alarmists themselves. It is likely that both kin and individual selection, acting on an individual’s inclusive fitness, have played a role in the evolution of vervet monkeys’ alarm calls. © 1981, Brill.

AB  - Aposematic animals use anti-predator defence mechanisms such as distastefulness coupled with distinctive odours, sounds, or colour patterns to signal their unprofitability to potential predators. By subjecting artificial 'butterflies' with different visual signals to predation from domestic chicks we show that the protective value of such visual warning displays is enhanced by increasing size of the signal pattern elements and decreased by pattern asymmetry. These results provide the first experimental evidence that predation may select for individual symmetry of visual warning displays, and concur with earlier demonstrations that asymmetric signals are more difficult to detect, learn, and remember, compared to symmetric signals. Collectively, our findings suggest that prey species possessing warning coloration should be subjected to selection for large and symmetric pattern elements.

AB  - Visual patterns in animals may serve different functions, such as attracting mates and deceiving predators. If a signal is used for multiple functions, the opportunity arises for conflict among the different functions, preventing optimization for any one visual signal. Here we investigate the hypothesis that spatial separation of different visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. Using phylogenetic reconstructions of character evolution and comparisons of evolutionary rates, we found dorsal surface characters to evolve at higher rates than ventral characters. Dorsal characters also displayed sex-based differences in evolutionary rates more often than did ventral characters. Thus, dorsal characters corresponded to our predictions of mate signalling while ventral characters appear to play an important role in predator avoidance. Forewing characters also fit a model of mate signalling, and displayed higher rates of evolution than hindwing characters. Our results, as well as the behavioural and developmental data from previous studies of Bicyclus species, support the hypothesis that spatial separation of visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. This study is the first to demonstrate, in a phylogenetic framework, that spatial separation of signals used for mate signalling and those used for predator avoidance is a viable strategy to accommodate multiple signal functions. This signalling strategy has important ramifications on the developmental evolution of wing pattern elements and diversification of butterfly species. © 2009 The Royal Society.

AB  - Modularity in animal development is thought to have facilitated morphological diversification, but independent change of those traits integrated within a module might be restricted. Correlations among traits describe potential developmental constraints on evolution. These have often been postulated to explain patterns of morphological variation and have been examined theoretically but seldom analyzed experimentally. Here, we use artificial selection to explore the modular organization of butterfly wing patterns and the extent to which their evolution is constrained by the genetic correlations among repeated pattern elements. We show that, in Bicyclus anynana butterflies, despite the evidence that all eyespots are developmentally coupled, the response to selection for increased size of one individual eyespot can proceed in a manner largely independent from selection imposed on another eyespot. We argue that among-eyespot correlations are unlikely to have constrained the evolutionary diversification of butterfly wing patterns but might be important when only limited time is available for adaptive evolution to occur. The ease with which we have been able to produce independent responses to artificial selection on different eyespots may be linked to a legacy of natural selection favoring individuality. Our results are discussed within the context of the evolution of modularity and individuality of serially repeated morphological traits.

AB  - Rather than simply escaping, prey animals often attempt to deter an attack by signalling to an approaching predator, but this is a risky strategy if it allows time for the predator to draw closer (especially when the signal is a bluff) [1,2]. Because prey are vulnerable to multiple predators, the hunting techniques of which vary widely, it could well be beneficial for a prey animal to discriminate predators and to signal only to those that are likely to be deterred. Higher vertebrates make alarm calls that can identify the type of predator to the signaller's conspecifics [3,4], and a recent study shows that squirrels direct an infrared deterrent signal specifically at infrared-sensitive pit-vipers and not at other snakes [5]. We show here that naïve juvenile cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis L.) use a visual signal selectively during encounters with different predatory species. We analysed sequences of defensive behaviours produced by cuttlefish, to control for effects of relative threat level (or 'response urgency' [4]). This showed that a high contrast 'eyespot' signal, known as the deimatic display [6], was used before flight against visually oriented teleost fish, but not crabs and dogfish, which are chemosensory predators [7,8]. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - John Maynard Smith was the founder of evolutionary game theory. He has also been the major influence on the direction of this field, which now pervades behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology. In its original formulation the theory had three components: a set of strategies, a payoff structure, and a concept of evolutionary stability. These three key components are still the basis of the theory, but what is assumed about each component is often different to the original assumptions. We review modern approaches to these components. We emphasis that if a game is considered in isolation, and arbitrary payoffs are assumed, then the payoffs may not be consistent with other components of the system which are not modelled. Modelling the whole system, including not only the focal game, but also the future behaviour of the players and the behaviour of other population members, allows a consistent model to be constructed. We illustrate this in the case of two models of parental care, showing how linking a focal game to other aspects of the system alters what is predicted. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Background: Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions-in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities. © 2010 Olofsson et al.

AB  - The visual displays of animals and plants often look dramatic and colourful to us, but what information do they convey to their intended, non-human, audience [1,2]? One possibility is that stimulus values are judged accurately - so, for example, a female might choose a suitor if he displays a specific colour [3]. Alternatively, as for human advertising, displays may attract attention without giving information, perhaps by exploiting innate preferences for bright colours or symmetry [2,4,5]. To address this issue experimentally, we investigated chicks' memories of visual patterns. Food was placed in patterned paper containers which, like seed pods or insect prey, must be manipulated to extract food and their patterns learnt. To establish what was learnt, birds were tested on familiar stimuli and on alternative stimuli of differing colour or contrast. For colour, birds selected the trained stimulus; for contrast, they preferred high contrast patterns over the familiar. These differing responses to colour and contrast show how separate components of display patterns could serve different roles, with colour being judged accurately whereas pattern contrast attracts attention.

AB  - We propose that the many different, but essentially similar, eye-like and face-like color patterns displayed by hundreds of species of tropical caterpillars and pupae - 26 examples of which are displayed here from the dry, cloud, and rain forests of Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica - constitute a huge and pervasive mimicry complex that is evolutionarily generated and sustained by the survival behavior of a large and multispecific array of potential predators: the insect-eating birds. We propose that these predators are variously and innately programmed to flee when abruptly confronted, at close range, with what appears to be an eye of one of their predators. Such a mimetic complex differs from various classical Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes of adult butterflies in that (i) the predators sustain it for the most part by innate traits rather than by avoidance behavior learned through disagreeable experiences, (ii) the more or less harmless, sessile, and largely edible mimics vastly outnumber the models, and (iii) there is no particular selection for the eye-like color pattern to closely mimic the eye or face of any particular predator of the insect-eating birds or that of any other member of this mimicry complex. Indeed, selection may not favor exact resemblance among these mimics at all. Such convergence through selection could create a superabundance of one particular false eyespot or face pattern, thereby increasing the likelihood of a bird species or guild learning to associate that pattern with harmless prey.

AB  - Two experiments demonstrated the pigeon's sensitivity to ultraviolet light. In Experiment I, pigeons' responses were reinforced on a multiple schedule with a variable‐interval reinforcement schedule in one component and extinction in the other component. Response rates were quite different in the two components where the 520‐nm stimuli signalling each component differed only in that one of them contained a 366‐nm ultraviolet component. In Experiment II, pigeons were trained to peck one side key when two halves of a split field were of different wavelength and to peck another side key when they were of the same wavelength. Initially, field halves contained both “visible” and ultraviolet components of energy. Discrimination performance improved when the ultraviolet component was removed from one field half. It was argued that the critical change in the stimulus was a color change, rather than a brightness one, or a fluorescence of structures in the pigeon's eye. 1972 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior

AB  - The night sky is the venue for an ancient arms race. Insectivorous bats with their ultrasonic sonar exert an enormous selective pressure on nocturnal insects. In response insects have evolved the ability to hear bat cries, to evade their hunting maneuvers, and some, the tiger moths (Arctiidae), to utter an ultrasonic reply. We here determine what it is that tiger moths "say" to bats. We chose four species of arctiid moths, Cycnia tenera, Euchaetes egle, Utetheisa ornatrix, and Apantesis nais, that naturally differ in their levels of unpalatability and their ability to produce sound. Moths were tethered and offered to free-flying naïve big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus. The ability of the bats to capture each species was compared to their ability to capture noctuid, geometrid, and wax moth controls over a learning period of 7 days. We repeated the experiment using the single arctiid species E. egle that through diet manipulation and simple surgery could be rendered palatable or unpalatable and sound producing or mute. We again compared the capture rates of these categories of E. egle to control moths. Using both novel learning approaches we have found that the bats only respond to the sounds of arctiids when they are paired with defensive chemistry. The sounds are in essence a warning to the bats that the moth is unpalatable-an aposematic signal. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - Physical design features of animal visual signals have rarely been analysed. The parameters of motion patterns found in the visual displays of the iguanid lizard, Anolis auratus, were analysed by comparing a long-range display directed at unattentive viewers with a short-range display directed at attentive viewers. Movements in the long-range display were of higher amplitude, increasing the distance over which the display can be resolved. The initial portion of the long-range display contained movements of extremely high acceleration and velocity, which have been shown to be extremely effective at drawing attention. It is shown that the physical properties of a visual signal depend on the context in which it is used, and the response properties of the visual system. © 1988.

AB  - Animals that are brightly colored have intrigued scientists since the time of Darwin, because it seems surprising that prey should have evolved to be clearly visible to predators. Often this self-advertisement is explained by the prey being unprofitable in some way, with the conspicuous warning coloration helping to protect the prey because it signals to potential predators that the prey is unprofitable. However, such signals only work in this way once predators have learned to associate the conspicuous color with the unprofitability of the prey. The evolution of warning coloration is still widely considered to be a paradox, because it has traditionally been assumed that the very first brightly colored individuals would be at an immediate selective disadvantage because of their greater conspicuousness to predators that are naive to the meaning of the signal. As a result, it has been difficult to understand how a novel conspicuous color morph could ever avoid extinction for long enough for predators to become educated about the signal. Thus, the traditional view that the evolution of warning coloration is difficult to explain rests entirely on assumptions about the foraging behavior of predators. However, we review recent evidence from a range of studies of predator foraging decisions, which refute these established assumptions. These studies show that: (1) Many predators are so conservative in their food preferences that even very conspicuous novel prey morphs are not necessarily at a selective disadvantage. (2) The survival and spread of novel color morphs can be simulated in field and aviary experiments using real predators (birds) foraging on successive generations of artificial prey populations. This work demonstrates that the foraging preferences of predators can regularly (though not always) result in the increase to fixation of a novel morph appearing in a population of familiar-colored prey. Such fixation events occur even if both novel and familiar prey are fully palatable and despite the novel food being much more conspicuous than the familiar prey. These studies therefore provide strong empirical evidence that conspicuous coloration can evolve readily, and repeatedly, as a result of the conservative foraging decisions of predators. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Multimodal defensive displays are commonplace, with prey combining conspicuous coloration, sounds, odours and other chemical emissions to deter predators. These components can signal to predators in multiple signal modalities to warn them that prey are defended. The aim of our review is to examine the form and function of multimodal warning displays. Data collected from the literature on multimodal insect warning displays show the degree of complexity and diversity that needs to be explained, and we identify patterns in the data that may be worthy of more rigorous investigation. We also provide a theoretical framework for the study of multimodal warning displays, and evaluate the evidence for different functional hypotheses that can explain their widespread evolution. Our review highlights that whilst multimodal warning displays are well documented, particularly in insects, we lack a good understanding of their function in natural predator-prey systems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The behaviour of male speckled wood butterflies, Pararge aegeria L. (Satyrinae), was studied in relation to the following phenotypic traits: dorsal wing colour, submarginal wing spots, wing length and generation. Wing colour was of overriding importance. Pale males spent most of their time resting within a sunlit patch and engaged in short flights and intra- and interspecific interactions. Darker males flew more frequently between sunlit patches through the shaded forest. Thus males differing in phenotype did not have the same probability of showing perching, patrolling or an intermediate type of mate-locating behaviour. Darker and larger males were also more likely to leave the forest. There was very little effect of spot type, but a clear influence of generation on the behavioural variation. It is hypothesized that the observed variation is related to differences in thermoregulation between differently coloured individuals. Darker individuals are expected to have an increased warming rate which means that they can spend more time flying through the shady wood from one sunlit patch to another, while pale males will not suffer from overheating as soon as dark ones when settled on a sunlit patch. This in turn causes variation in their adaptedness to different behavioural strategies.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana has a series of distal eyespots on its wings. Each eyespot is composed of a white pupil, a black disc, and a gold outer ring. We applied artificial selection to the large dorsal eyespot on the forewing to produce a line with the gold ring reduced or absent (BLACK) and another line with a reduced black disc and a broad gold ring (GOLD). High heritabilities, coupled with a rapid response to selection, produced two lines of butterflies with very different phenotypes. Other eyespots showed a correlated change in the proportion of their color rings. Surgical experiments were performed on pupal wings from the different lines at the time of eyespot pattern specification. They showed that the additive genetic variance for this trait was in the response of the wing epidermis to signaling from the organizing cells at the eyespot center (the focus). This response was found to vary across different regions of the wing and also between the sexes. The particular eyespot color composition found for each sex, as well as the maintenance of the high genetic variation, are discussed with reference to the ecology of the butterfly, sexual selection, and visual selection by predators.

AB  - Reptiles produce sound by three categories of devices: those involving massive air expulsions or movements, those involving modulations of intermittent air movements through a modified glottis, and those involving rubbing or vibration of the integument. Each ocours in numerous species and there is good evidence of multiple origins. Most of the devices are used as predator deterrents, but there are a few cases of sound being used as an intraspecific communicating device. The various structures are here discussed. One may ask the general question whether the distribution of reptilian sensory modalities may not have forced this rather miscellaneous distribution of signalling devices. © 1973 by the American Society of Zoologists.

AB  - Background. There is spectacular morphological diversity in nature but lineages typically display a limited range of phenotypes. Because developmental processes generate the phenotypic variation that fuels natural selection, they are a likely source of evolutionary biases, facilitating some changes and limiting others. Although shifts in developmental regulation are associated with morphological differences between taxa, it is unclear how underlying mechanisms affect the rate and direction of evolutionary change within populations under selection. Here we focus on two ecologically relevant features of butterfly wing color patterns, eyespot size and color composition, which are similarly and strongly correlated across the serially repeated eyespots. Though these two characters show similar patterns of standing variation and covariation within a population, they differ in key features of their underlying development. We targeted pairs of eyespots with artificial selection for coordinated (concerted selection) versus independent (antagonistic selection) change in their color composition and size and compared evolutionary responses of the two color pattern characters. Results. The two characters respond to selection in strikingly different ways despite initially similar patterns of variation in all directions present in the starting population. Size (determined by local properties of a diffusing inductive signal) evolves flexibly in all selected directions. However, color composition (determined by a tissue-level response to the signal concentration gradient) evolves only in the direction of coordinated change. There was no independent evolutionary change in the color composition of two eyespots in response to antagonistic selection. Moreover, these differences in the directions of short-term evolutionary change in eyespot size and color composition within a single species are consistent with the observed wing pattern diversity in the genus. Conclusion. Both characters respond rapidly to selection for coordinated change, but there are striking differences in their response to selection for antagonistic, independent change across eyespots. While many additional factors may contribute to both short- and long-term evolutionary response, we argue that the compartmentalization of developmental processes can influence the diversification of serial repeats such as butterfly eyespots, even under strong selection. © 2008 Allen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The eyespots on the ventral wings of Bicyclus anynana butterflies are exposed when at rest and interact with predators. Those on the dorsal surface are not exposed in this way, and may be involved in courtship and mate choice. In this study, we examined whether the size and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of dorsal eyespots are reliable signals of male quality. High developmental stability is considered to result in low FA, and to be associated with high quality. Individuals of high quality are predicted to produce sexually selected traits that are large and symmetrical, at a relatively low cost. In this study, we manipulated eyespot development to uncouple eyespot size and FA in order to examine their independent roles in signalling to the female. Individual females in cages were given the choice between two or three males differing in eyespot traits. The results indicate that although size per se of the eyespots is used as a signal, FA and wing size are not. We discuss the use of FA in studies of sexual selection and aspects of sexual selection on dorsal eyespot size.

AB  - Eyespot colour patterns decorate the wings of many butterfly species. The eyespot is specified in the early pupal epidermis by signals from a central ‘focus,’ and it has been suggested that the focus is the source of a diffusible morphogen gradient. We show that ectopic eyespots can be induced in nonfocal positions throughout the distal, but not the proximal, wing epidermis of Bicyclus anynana by mild epidermal damage inflicted at 12-18 hr (into a 6- to 7-day pupal period). Damage may lower, locally and transiently, the threshold for response to morphogen. Here, we have tested two predictions of the gradient model. As predicted, mild damage close to the focus (parafocal) locally extends the eyespot, making it markedly asymmetrical, even after early operations (1 or 6 hr), when remote epidermis is nonresponsive. Early parafocal operations also have an unexpected result, however, reducing the extent of the eyespot in other directions, perhaps through a long-range ‘wound effect’ on the signaling activity of the focal cells. The model also correctly predicts that increasing the severity of a nonfocal operation will prolong the transient damage and hence give ectopic eyespots after early (1- or 6-hr) operations. We do not, however, find the expected size increase in ectopics induced by the later (12 or 18 hr) severe damage. Similarly, we demonstrate the predicted effect of early (1 or 6 hr) mild damage in increasing the response to a subsequent (18 hr) operation at the same position. The gradient model is therefore supported by most aspects of eyespot induction in response to epidermal damage. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The defensive behaviour of 25 species of praying mantids from Ghana is described. All have camouflage as the primary defence mechanism, either a general resemblance to vegetation, or a specific resemblance to bark, sticks, leaves or grass. Secondary defence mechanisms include running, flying, thanatosis, secretion of fluid from the mouth, startle display and flash colouration. The early instars of several species are ant‐mimics. The female Taracbodes afzelii often guards her ootheca and also the young nymphs, and she can distinguish her nymphs from intruding ants which are attacked. Some mantids have a green/brown polymorphism and there is evidence that the frequencies of the two forms vary seasonally. Other mantids are stick, grass or bark mimics, and the possible ways in which the adaptations of these forms have evolved are outlined. The startle display is probably a bluff which protects the mantid to some extent from avian predators. It does not appear to be directed against predaceous mammals. A curious “boxing display” is described from Oxypilus, Anasigerpes and Catasigerpes. It probably functions to space out individuals, not to discourage attacks from predators. The occurrence of this display is used as taxonomic evidence for the close relationship of these three genera. Copyright © 1972, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Many butterfly genera are characterised by the presence of marginal eyespots on their wings. One hypothesis to account for an occurrence of eyespots is that these wing pattern elements are partly the outcome of visual selection by predators. Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) has underside spotting on its wings but there is also a seasonal form in which the eyespots are reduced in size or totally absent. This natural variation gives us a useful tool to test the hypothesis that marginal eyespot patterns can decoy the attacking predator by, at least sometimes, diverting attack from vital body parts to the edges of the wings. We used lizards, Anolis carolinensis, and pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, as predators for living spotted and spotless B. anynana. The presence of eyespots did not increase the escape probability of resting butterflies once captured (even a form with enlarged eyespots did not add to effective deflection of attacks). There was also no evidence that eyespots influenced the location of strikes by the predators. This study thus provides no support that marginal eyespot patterns can act as an effective deflection mechanism to avoid lizard or avian predation.

AB  - We examined the antipredator mechanisms of 19 Australian hylid species (two genera) and 23 myobatrachid species (nine genera). Frogs of 39 of the 42 species exhibited one or more defensive mechanisms (other than escape), including postures, bright coloration, adhesive skin secretions, and/or calls. Defensive posturing occurred in individuals of 38 species, and varied in relationship to morphology and localization of skin glands. Bright colors, when present, typically were displayed during defensive postures. We documented dramatic geographic variation in the antipredator display of one species, Limnodynastes tasmaniensis. Defensive postures were accompanied by secretions from dorsal skin glands. These secretions were sometimes associated with a distinctive odor. Adhesive skin secretions were present in burrowing frogs of three genera. Defensive calls were emitted by most hylids but none of the myobatrachids. We offer a hypothesis of mimicry to explain the behavior pattern of exposing the bold black and white ventral surface in Pseudophryne and Crinia species.

AB  - Automimicry is the existence of palatable individuals in an unpalatable, warningly coloured (i.e. aposematic) prey species. Because automimics are visually indistinguishable from their models, they present a special problem for the evolutionary stability of aposematism. Traditionally this problem has remained either unrecognized, or has been considered solved by the actions of naive predators that attack warningly coloured prey, eating-them if palatable, rejecting them if unpalatable. Although naive predators can stabilize aposematism against invasion by automimics, the conditions under which they can do so are restricted. It is argued here that an adjustment to the traditional view of how aposematic signals operate can offer a more general solution to the problem of automimicry. The 'go-slow signalling' solution proposes that some predators learn not to avoid aposematic prey, but to sample them cautiously in order to determine their true palatability more accurately. Because unpalatable prey can benefit by advertising conspicuously to go-slow predators, but cannot benefit by advertising to naive predators (unless predators are innately cautious of conspicuously coloured prey), go-slow signalling can stabilize aposematism under a wider range of conditions than can traditional naive predators. The assumptions, predictions, and empirical implications of the go-slow signalling hypothesis are discussed. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The eyespots on butterfly wings are thought to be serially homologous pattern elements. Yet eyespots differ greatly in number, shape, color, and size, within and among species. To what extent do these serially homologues have separate developmental identities, upon which selection acts to create diversity? We examined x-ray-induced mutations for the eyespots of the nymphalid butterfly Bicyclus anynana that highlight the modular control of these serially homologous wing pattern elements. These mutations reduce or eliminate individual eyespots, or groups of eyespots, with no further effect on the wing color pattern. The collection of mutants highlights a greater potential developmental repertoire than that observed across the genus Bicyclus. We studied in detail one such mutation, of codominant effect, that causes the elimination of two adjacent eyespots on the ventral hindwing. By analyzing the expression of genes known to be involved in eyespot formation, we found an alteration in the differentiation of the "organizing" cells at the eyespot's center. No such cells differentiate in the wing subdivisions lacking the two eyespots in the mutants. We propose several developmental models, based on wing compartmentalization in Drosophila, that provide the first framework for thinking about the molecular evolution of butterfly wing pattern modularity.

AB  - Meadow brown butterflies showed an aggregated microdistribution on a meadow at Hightown, near Liverpool. Intraseasonal changes and differences between years (generations) in microdistribution were correlated with changes in the distribution of clumps of flowering plants. Such changes in males were probably also influenced by the distribution of emerging females. The sexes showed statistically different microdistributions associated with differences in resource requirements. A low rate of movement from areas of favorable habitat was detected. The frequency distribution of the distance moved was leptokurtic. Butterflies tended to restrict their activity to familiar areas within the habitat of this population. The home range (95%) of individuals was overconservatively estimated as 0.85+ or -0.065 ha. Males and females showed similar dispersal rates, but males fly more often than females. Males show a characteristic exploratory flight for mates. Females fly to lay eggs and to feed. Nectar is probably a more important resource for females than males. Males and females occupy different ecological niches. -from Author

AB  - It is an established fact that the spectacular bioluminescent displays of adult fireflies and glow-worms are used as courtship signals; however, the survival value of the glowing behavior of their larvae remained the subject of speculation for many years. Our study is the first that demonstrates that lampyrid larvae use luminescence to signal unpalatability to nocturnal, visually guided predators. Wild-caught toads (Bufo bufo) were more reluctant to attack luminescent artificial prey, and we show that avoidance learning increased this reluctance. After being exposed to glow-worm larvae (Lampyris noctiluca), which the toads experienced as disagreeable, attack latencies to luminescent prey increased, but not those to nonglowing prey. Not all toads showed avoidance learning to the same extent, because of either differences in previous experience with glow-worms or differences in memory.

The chick's behaviour was recorded over a 3-min period. Each bird was exposed to a stimulus which varied in three ways, being either circular concentric (eye-like) or rectangular, single or paired and which appeared to either persistently look at (track) or look away from (avoid) the chick. All three manipulations produced significant effects on how close the bird approached. The most avoided combination was two, tracking, eyelike shapes. The results are discussed in the context of the problems involved in isolating the effective components of stares and the head forwards threat posture. © 1976.

AB  - To date, theoretical or laboratory simulations of aposematic evolution in prey animals have focused narrowly on internally stored chemical defense as the source of unprofitability and ignore aposematic advertisement of physical defenses such as spines (and defensive hairs, claws, etc.). This has occurred even though aposematism in spiny animals has been recognized since the 19th century. In this paper we present the first detailed theoretical consideration of aposematism in spiny animals, focusing on questions of initial evolution, costs of display, and coevolution of displays with defenses. Using an individual-based evolutionary model, we found that spines (or similar physical defenses) can easily evolve without aposematism, but when spines do evolve, aposematic displays can also easily evolve if they help to make the prey animal distinctive and if they draw attention to the physical threat. When aposematic displays evolve, they cause reduced investment in costly spines, so that, in addition to signaling unprofitability, aposematic display may enhance the cost-effectiveness of antipredator defenses (one exception to this conclusion is if the display is itself as costly as the defense). For animals with stinging spines, combining physical and chemical defense, the evolution of aposematic display may lead to reduced investment in the toxin compared to the spine. This occurs because spines act as both secondary (repellent) defenses and as primary defenses (their own visible, honest advertisement), whereas internally stored toxins only (generally) act as repellent secondary defenses. We argue that conspicuous aposematism in spines functions as an attention-getting mechanism, whereas conspicuous aposematic display in purely toxic animals may be explained by signal reliability arguments. Finally, one (more) route by which aposematism may initially evolve is by spiny rather than purely chemically defended species, spreading to species with other forms of secondary defense as the signal becomes common. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Species of the genus Pleurodema are relatively small, plump frogs that mostly occur in strong-seasonal and dry environments. The genus currently comprises 14 species distributed from Panama to southern Patagonia. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of Pleurodema, including all described species and several outgroups. Our goals include testing its monophyly and the monophyly of the species groups that were historically proposed, and studying the evolution of some character systems, particularly macroglands and egg-clutch structure; this last point also provided the chance for a discussion of foam nest evolution in anurans. Our dataset includes portions of the mitochondrial genes cytochromeb, 12S, 16S, and the intervening tRNA Val; the nuclear gene sequences include portions of rhodopsin exon 1 and seven in absentia homolog I. Our results support a clade composed of Pleurodema and including the monotypic SomuncuriaLynch, 1978 nested within it. The latter genus is therefore considered a junior synonym of Pleurodema and its sole species is added to this genus. Furthermore, our results indicate the non-monophyly of several species groups proposed previously. We recognize four clades in Pleurodema: the P. bibroni clade (P. bibroni, P. cordobae and P. kriegi), the P. thaul clade (P. bufoninum, P. marmoratum, P. somuncurensis and P. thaul), the P. brachyops clade (P. alium, P. borellii, P. brachyops, P. cinereum, P. diplolister and P. tucumanum) and the P. nebulosum clade (P. guayapae and P. nebulosum). Our results further indicate the need for a taxonomic reassessment of P. borellii and P. cinereum (as did previous studies), P. guayapae and P. nebulosum, and the three species in the P. bibroni clade. Pleurodema shows a striking pattern of variation in presence/absence of lumbar glands. Our results indicate multiple losses or independent gains of this character associated with defensive displays. The reproductive modes of Pleurodema include four different egg-clutch structures. The optimization of these indicates that there are at least two independent transformations from the plesiomorphic mode of foam nests to egg-clutch structures involving gelatinous masses of different sorts (ovoid plates, masses, or strings). We hypothesize that these independent transformations could involve changes at the behavioural (the loss of foam beating behaviour by the parent) and/or structural level (transformations involving the pars convoluta dilata, the section of the oviduct where the foam-making substance is secreted). Finally, our study of foam nest evolution in Pleurodema is extended to the other groups of anurans where foam-nesting occurs, on the basis of available data and recent phylogenetic hypotheses. In the different hyloid groups where it occurs, foam-nesting evolved from clutches laid in water. However, in all ranoids in which foam-nesting occurs, it evolved from terrestrial clutches, with eggs laid hanging in vegetation, or, if the clutches are laid on a restricted volume of water, involving endotrophic development. © The Willi Hennig Society 2012.

AB  - When the mantid Stagmatoptera biocellata is shown a foe, the insect displays a characteristic response called the deimatic reaction (DR) (Fig. 1). A systematic study of the response is presented in this paper. 1. The full display is an assembly of seven independent and very stereotyped components. The lesser the strength of the reaction, the smaller the number of components. They disappear in a stereotyped order. 2. The occurrence of the DR proved to be highly predictable using birds as releasers (i.e. troupials, shiny cow-birds, Java sparrow and canarys). But the DR was also induced by the back projection of real or filmed shiny cow-birds silhouettes. Only a film taken and projected at 100 frames a second induced a DR as a "real" stimulus. 3. A DR is immediately induced by a bird presented for 2 minutes. The response duration exceedes the presentation interval. The leftover time ranged from few seconds to 45 minutes. When the insect and the predator were faced for long time, the DR was displayed as long as the stimulus was shown and a response that lasted 6 hours was recorded. Some conclusions were deduced from testing crude interferences in the nervous system (Fig. 3). Namely, that the DR can be elicited either by visual and tactile stimuli, and that the movements involved in the display are not coordinated with each other in a closed-circuit system. This finding is discussed in connection with an hypothesis put forward by Vowles (1961). 4. The survival value of the DR is analyzed and the paper concludes, unlike previous reports, that the over-all effect of the display is to frighten the foe. © 1970 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Animals often eat foods containing toxins to benefit from the nutrients that they contain. Understanding how animals balance the costs of eating toxins with the benefits of gaining nutrients is important for understanding the evolution of antipredator defenses, particularly aposematism and mimicry. In this study, we tested whether predators could learn to use color signals to make strategic decisions about when to include prey that varied in their toxin content in their diets. We gave European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) daily sessions of sequentially presented mealworms (Tenebrio molitor). There were 3 types of mealworm which were made discriminable using color signals: undefended mealworms injected with water, mildly defended mealworms injected with 1% quinine solution, and moderately defended mealworms injected with 3% quinine solution. Birds learned to eat more undefended than defended prey and more mildly than moderately defended prey. Crucially, when we manipulated the birds' energetic states using food restriction, we found that they increased the number of defended prey that they ate but maintained their relative preferences. Birds made state-dependent decisions based upon their knowledge of the amount of toxin prey contained and their current energetic need. Our results provide novel insights into the evolution of aposematic signals and also demonstrate that we may need to develop new models of the evolution of mimicry based on the state-dependent behavior of predators. Our data also have broader implications for the study of nutrient-toxin trade-offs across a range of different ecological scenarios. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Stimuli varying in intensity and chromaticity, presented on numerous backgrounds, were classified into red/green, blue/yellow and white/black opponent color categories. These measurements revealed the shapes of the boundaries that separate opponent colors in three-dimensional color space. Opponent color classification boundaries were generally not planar, but their shapes could be summarized by a piecewise linear model in which increment and decrement color signals are combined with different weights at two stages to produce opponent color sensations. The effect of background light on classification was largely explained by separate gain changes in increment and decrement cone signals. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Background: Autonomous reflexes enable animals to respond quickly to potential threats, prevent injury and mediate fight or flight responses. Intense acoustic stimuli with sudden onsets elicit a startle reflex while stimuli of similar intensity but with longer rise times only cause a cardiac defence response. In laboratory settings, habituation appears to affect all of these reflexes so that the response amplitude generally decreases with repeated exposure to the stimulus. The startle reflex has become a model system for the study of the neural basis of simple learning processes and emotional processing and is often used as a diagnostic tool in medical applications. However, previous studies did not allow animals to avoid the stimulus and the evolutionary function and long-term behavioural consequences of repeated startling remain speculative. In this study we investigate the follow-up behaviour associated with the startle reflex in wild-captured animals using an experimental setup that allows individuals to exhibit avoidance behaviour.Results: We present evidence that repeated elicitation of the acoustic startle reflex leads to rapid and pronounced sensitisation of sustained spatial avoidance behaviour in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Animals developed rapid flight responses, left the exposure pool and showed clear signs of fear conditioning. Once sensitised, seals even avoided a known food source that was close to the sound source. In contrast, animals exposed to non-startling (long rise time) stimuli of the same maximum sound pressure habituated and flight responses waned or were absent from the beginning. The startle threshold of grey seals expressed in units of sensation levels was comparable to thresholds reported for other mammals (93 dB).Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the acoustic startle reflex plays a crucial role in mediating flight responses and strongly influences the motivational state of an animal beyond a short-term muscular response by mediating long-term avoidance. The reflex is therefore not only a measure of emotional state but also influences emotional processing. The biological function of the startle reflex is most likely associated with mediating rapid flight responses. The data indicate that repeated startling by anthropogenic noise sources might have severe effects on long-term behaviour. Future, studies are needed to investigate whether such effects can be associated with reduced individual fitness or even longevity of individuals. © 2011 Götz and Janik; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The book reviews the natural history of this generally little-known group (the Lepidoptera excluding butterflies), which comprises over 2000 species in the UK. After an introductory chapter, the author draws together the results of amateur study and the latest scientific research in chapters on: the origins and distribution of Britain's moths; dispersal, migration and orientation; life cycles and hibernation; plants as food for moths; plant defence against larvae; mating behaviour and the use of pheromones in the control of moth pests; moth predators and population dynamics; catching and studying moths; and the conservation of moths. Numerous examples of spcies studies from the scientific literature are included to illustrate aspects such as distributions, subspecies, races and clines, orientation cues, mass migrations, strategies for emergence from pupae, feeding strategies, responses to chemical defence, predator avoidance, crypsis and mimicry, and endangered species and species undergoing conservation action.

AB  - Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The commercial importance of Pacific and Atlantic herring (Clupea pallasii and Clupea harengus) has ensured that much of their biology has received attention. However, their sound production remains poorly studied. We describe the sounds made by captive wild-caught herring. Pacific herring produce distinctive bursts of pulses, termed Fast Repetitive Tick (FRT) sounds. These trains of broadband pulses (1.7-22 kHz) lasted between 0.6 s and 7.6 s. Most were produced at night; feeding regime did not affect their frequency, and fish produced FRT sounds without direct access to the air. Digestive gas or gulped air transfer to the swim bladder, therefore, do not appear to be responsible for FRT sound generation. Atlantic herring also produce FRT sounds, and video analysis showed an association with bubble expulsion from the anal duct region (i.e. from the gut or swim bladder). To the best of the authors' knowledge, sound production by such means has not previously been described. The function (s) of these sounds are unknown, but as the per capita rates of sound production by fish at higher densities were greater, social mediation appears likely. These sounds may have consequences for our understanding of herring behaviour and the effects of noise pollution.

AB  - A tenet of auditory scene analysis is that we can fully process only one stream of auditory information at a time. We tested this assumption in a gleaning bat, the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) because this bat uses echolocation for general orientation, and relies heavily on prey-generated sounds to detect and locate its prey. It may therefore encounter situations in which the echolocation and passive listening streams temporally overlap. Pallid bats were trained to a dual task in which they had to negotiate a wire array, using echolocation, and land on one of 15 speakers emitting a brief noise burst in order to obtain a food reward. They were forced to process both streams within a narrow 300 to 500 ms time window by having the noise burst triggered by the bats' initial echolocation pulses as it approached the wire array. Relative to single task controls, echolocation and passive sound localization performance was slightly, but significantly, degraded. The bats also increased echolocation interpulse intervals during the dual task, as though attempting to reduce temporal overlap between the signals. These results suggest that the bats, like humans, have difficulty in processing more than one stream of information at a time.

AB  - It has generally been assumed that warningly coloured organisms pay a cost associated with their increased visibility, because naïve predators notice and eat them. This cost is offset by their enhanced protection from educated predators who associate the colour pattern with unprofitability. However, some studies have suggested that avoidance of novel prey by avian predators ("dietary conservatism") can actually place novel colour morphs at a selective advantage over familiar ones, even when they are highly conspicuous. To test this idea, we experimentally simulated the appearance of a single novel-coloured mutant in small populations (20 individuals) of palatable artificial prey. The colour morph frequencies in each "generation" were determined by the relative survival of the previous generation under predation by birds. We used wild-caught European robins Erithacus rubecula foraging on pastry "prey" of different colours. The aim was to test whether prey selection by predators prevented or facilitated the novel colour morph persisting in the prey population over successive generations. We found that the novel colour morph quickly increased to fixation in 14/40 prey "populations", and at least once each in 8 of the 10 birds tested. Novel mutants of the classic aposematic colours (red and yellow) reached fixation most frequently, but even the green and blue novel morphs both increased to fixation in 2/40 trials. Novel colours reached fixation significantly faster than could be accounted for by drift, indicating active avoidance by the birds. These results suggest that a novel colour morph arising in a prey population can persist and increase under the selective pressure imposed by predators, even to the local exclusion of the original morph, despite being fully palatable. The consequences of this finding are discussed in relation to receiver psychology, the evolution of aposematism and the existence of polymorphism in Müllerian mimics.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that eye-shapes are aversive to the domestic chick but controversy remains over the relative importance of various features of the eyes in causing aversion. In this study the potency of various eye-like shapes in causing avoidance was evaluated. It was shown that monochromatic, two-dimensional eye shapes elicit avoidance and fear in young male domestic chicks, and that the eye shapes are not responded to merely as conspicuous objects. Horizontal orientation, pairedness and the presence of both an 'iris' and a 'pupil' are important recognition cues. The shape of the eye-like stimulus appears to be more important than its size. Circularity of the iris is not an essential feature but further work is necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding the shape of the pupil although the available evidence does suggest that circularity is important. © 1980.

AB  - .1. The nature of the colour changes shown by Sepia officinalis L. in different environments is discussed. 2. Several patterns in the coloration of the animal, each appearing under certain specific conditions of stimulation, are described. 3. Each pattern is formed by a pattern of expansion and contraction of the chromatophores, supplemented by reflection from the immobile iridophores which lie below them. 4. The state of expansion of each chromatophore is determined by its musculature, which is under nervous control; and therefore each colour pattern is a manifestation of a pattern in the process of excitation of the chromatophore motor neurons in the central nervous system. 5. In no other Cephalopod than Sepia have such colour patterns been described, and they form a complex and highly developed system of protective coloration, adapted to the conditions under which Sepia lives. 6. The types of protection afforded by the colorations are discussed. Cryptic patterns are found affording protection through obliterative shading, close environmental resemblance, and striking ruptive patterns. 7. Concealment is made more effective by the animal's ability to change its coloration from one pattern to another in times as short as two‐thirds of a second. 8. Certain of the colour changes probably protect Sepia by virtue of their great rapidity for, like any sudden change in the visual field, they produce a flight reaction in the predator. 9. Such rapid change of colour thus forms a new category in the classification of the means by which colour can afford protection to animals. 1940 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - Deimatic or 'startle' displays cause a receiver to recoil reflexively in response to a sudden change in sensory input. Deimatism is sometimes implicitly treated as a form of aposematism (unprofitability associated with a signal). However, the fundamental difference is, in order to provide protection, deimatism does not require a predator to have any learned or innate aversion. Instead, deimatism can confer a survival advantage by exploiting existing neural mechanisms in away that releases a reflexive response in the predator. We discuss the differences among deimatism, aposematism, and forms of mimicry, and their ecological and evolutionary implications. We highlight outstanding questions critical to progress in understanding deimatism. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 'false head' hypothesis states that due to the posterior ventral wing markings of certain butterflies which resemble a 'false head', visually hunting predators, such as birds, are deceived into attacking the hind wing area rather than the true head of the butterfly. Six groups of artificially marked dead cabbage butterflies Pieris rapae were presented to blue jays Cyanocitta cristata. Of the six 'false head', markings, only the eyespot significantly influenced the point of attack. All of the 'false head' markings, however, led to a greater proportion of attacks to the hind wing area of the butterfly. In the course of prey handling following an initial attack, each of the 6 'false head' markings significantly directed predator handling strikes away from the true head of captive butterflies to the anal angle of the hind wing. In a 2nd experiment, live P. rapae with 'false head' markings were mishandled and thus escaped, significantly more frequently than controls. 'False head' markings may thus confer a selective advantage by increasing the probability of escape, particularly during handling.-from Authors

AB  - Echolocation in bats and high-frequency hearing in their insect prey make bats and insects an ideal system for studying the sensory ecology and neuroethology of predator-prey interactions. Here, we review the evolutionary history of bats and eared insects, focusing on the insect order Lepidoptera, and consider the evidence for antipredator adaptations and predator counter-adaptations. Ears evolved in a remarkable number of body locations across insects, with the original selection pressure for ears differing between groups. Although cause and effect are difficult to determine, correlations between hearing and life history strategies in moths provide evidence for how these two variables influence each other. We consider life history variables such as size, sex, circadian and seasonal activity patterns, geographic range and the composition of sympatric bat communities.We also review hypotheses on the neural basis for antipredator behaviours (such as evasive flight and sound production) in moths. It is assumed that these prey adaptations would select for counter-adaptations in predatory bats. We suggest two levels of support for classifying bat traits as counter-adaptations: traits that allow bats to eat more eared prey than expected based on their availability in the environment provide a low level of support for counter-adaptations, whereas traits that have no other plausible explanation for their origination and maintenance than capturing defended prey constitute a high level of support. Specific predator counter-adaptations include calling at frequencies outside the sensitivity range of most eared prey, changing the pattern and frequency of echolocation calls during prey pursuit, and quiet, or 'stealth', echolocation. © 2016.

AB  - Some male Pararge aegeria perch in patches of sunlit vegetation in woodland understorey and defend them from other males to increase their probability of obtaining virgin females. Others patrol in search of females. When air temperature is low or in sites where sunlit areas are scarce the predominant behaviour of males is perching. Where sunlit areas are abundant the predominant behaviour is patrolling. In this study, different males adopted different behaviours, depending on their upper hind-wing spot phenotype. Those males with three upper hind-wing spots rarely defended sunlit areas from other males and were most abundant in open woodland. Males with four hind-wing spots defended sunlit areas from other males and were most abundant in closed woodland, where sunlit areas are scarce. The relative frequencies of these two phenotypes changed throughout the season and seasonal changes in the behaviour of males were correlated with changes in the frequencies of hind-wing spot phenotypes. © 1987.

AB  - Laboratory-reared 40-day-old white leghorn chicks were placed individually in an arena with a dummy bird. The dummy was either a predator (kestrel) or a strange, non-predatory species (kiwi), further distinguished by the conspicuousness of the eye region. The hawk's eyes were either left intact (conspicuous) or covered. The kiwi's eyes were untouched (inconspicuous) or accentuated. Birds approached the unaltered kiwi but strongly avoided the hawk. Obscuring the eyes diminished hawk avoidance. Enhancement increased aversion to the kiwi. These results indicate the potential importance of the eyes as a stimulus feature of non-conspecifics. © 1976.

AB  - Captive lesser mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) were observed to avert their heads during face-to-face encounters. Based on evidence obtained from other vertebrate species, predominantly among the Primates, it was assumed that the facing orientation and direction of gaze of an adversary was the provocative agent eliciting gaze aversion by mouse lemurs. A more precise examination of the perceptual determinants of gaze aversion employed models presenting various combinations of eyelike concentric circles. Presented side-by-side in paired comparisons, it was predicted that a model presenting two horizontally placed concentric circles, which schematically resemble two facing eyes, would elicit less visual inspection, i.e., more visual avoidance, than models presenting less physiognomic arrangements of concentric circles. Using a special model-viewing apparatus, Experiment I examined the gaze behavior of 28 mouse lemurs in their peak activity period to determine the response-eliciting effectiveness of 5 models varying in the number of concentric circles. Experiment 2 examined 50 lemurs, some of which were in seasonally and artificially induced torpor. Three models differing in the spatial orientation of two concentric circles were investigated in an attempt to control for contour complexity. Both the bout frequency and duration of model fixation were measured using head orientation as the response criterion. The following results were obtained: 1. For the over-all paired comparisons in both experiments, the model presenting two horizontally positioned concentric circles was the only model which elicited significantly fewer bouts of longer fixation. 2. Because of a lack of homogeneity in model fixation, due to intense fear in some lemurs, the lemurs were separated into homogeneous subgroups using statistical criteria in the first experiment and behavioral criteria in the second. Only the largest subgroups comprising relatively calm mouse lemurs exhibited differential model fixation at a significant level. In both experiments, these particular subgroups looked significantly less at the critical model exhibiting two schematic facing eyes than at any of the other models. In conjunction with observations of dyadic interactions among mouse lemurs, the experimental findings suggest the following: 1. Two schematic facing eyes viewed out of context with a predator or conspecific are a provocative source of stimulation eliciting less visual inspection which could be considered analogous to bouts of gaze aversion observed among interacting lemurs. 2. In concordance with laboratory observations of attenuated gaze aversion by frightened mouse lemurs, the more fear-motivated lemurs in the present experiments exhibited reduced differential model inspection. The affinity between these findings implies, perhaps, that fear-motivation increases the tendency to engage in less selective investigative gazing as the animal shifts into a protective behavior mode. This as well as any other functional interpretation of the role of gaze behavior during agonistic encounters, however, awaits further experimental support. © 1978, Brill. All rights reserved.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots have been the focus of a number of developmental and evolutionary studies. However, a phylogenetic component has rarely been explicitly incorporated in these studies. In this study, I utilize a phylogeny to trace the evolution of eyespot number and position on the wing in a group of nymphalid butterflies, the subtribe Junoniini. These butterflies have two kinds of eyespot arrangements which I refer to as Serial and Individual. In the Serial arrangement, eyespots are placed in a series on compartments 1-6 (counting from the anterior wing margin). In the Individual arrangement, eyespots are isolated on specific compartments, ranging from 1 to 4 in number. This can be divided into four subtypes based on the number and positions of eyespots. I map the evolution of these five arrangements over a phylogeny of Junoniini reconstructed with ca. 3000 base pairs of sequence data from three genes. The results show that almost all arrangements have evolved at least twice, with multiple shifts between them by addition and deletion of eyespots. I propose a model involving genetic or developmental coupling between eyespots in specific compartments to explain these shifts. I discuss their evolution in light of existing knowledge about their development. I also discuss potential explanations for functional significance of the eyespot patterns found in the group. Differential selection for and against eyespots, both at different times over the phylogeny and in different regions, have driven the evolution of eyespot arrangements. The study throws open many questions about the adaptive significance of eyespots and the developmental underpinnings of the various arrangements. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Locusts have two large collision-detecting neurons, the descending contralateral movement detectors (DCMDs) that signal object approach and trigger evasive glides during flight. We sought to investigate whether vision for action, when the locust is in an aroused state rather than a passive viewer, significantly alters visual processing in this collision-detecting pathway. To do this we used two different approaches to determine how the arousal state of a locust affects the prolonged periods of high-frequency spikes typical of the DCMD response to approaching objects that trigger evasive glides. First, we manipulated arousal state in the locust by applying a brief mechanical stimulation to the hind leg; this type of change of state occurs when gregarious locusts accumulate in high-density swarms. Second, we examined DCMD responses during flight because flight produces a heightened physiological state of arousal in locusts. When arousal was induced by either method we found that the DCMD response recovered from a previously habituated state; that it followed object motion throughout approach; and - most important - that it was significantly more likely to generate the maintained spike frequencies capable of evoking gliding dives even with extremely short intervals (1.8 s) between approaches. Overall, tethered flying locusts responded to 41% of simulated approaching objects (sets of 6 with 1.8 s ISI). When we injected epinastine, the neuronal octopamine receptor antagonist, into the hemolymph responsiveness declined to 12%, suggesting that octopamine plays a significant role in maintaining responsiveness of the DCMD and the locust to visual stimuli during flight.

AB  - We studied the efficiency and effects of the multiple sensory cues of tiger moths on echolocating bats. We used the northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, a purported moth specialist that takes surface-bound prey (gleaning) and airborne prey (aerial hawking), and the dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, an eared species unpalatable to bats that possesses conspicuous colouration and sound-producing organs (tymbals). This is the first study to investigate the interaction of tiger moths and wild-caught bats under conditions mimicking those found in nature and to demand the use of both aerial hawking and gleaning strategies by bats. Further, it is the first to report spectrograms of the sounds produced by tiger moths while under aerial attack by echolocating bats. During both aerial hawking and gleaning trials, all muted C. tenera and perched intact C. tenera were attacked by M. septentrionalis, indicating that M. septentrionalis did not discriminate C. tenera from palatable moths based on potential echoic and/or non-auditory cues. Intact C. tenera were attacked significantly less often than muted C. tenera during aerial hawking attacks: tymbal clicks were therefore an effective deterrent in an aerial hawking context. During gleaning attacks, intact and muted C. tenera were always attacked and suffered similar mortality rates, suggesting that while handling prey this bat uses primarily chemical signals. Our results also show that C. tenera temporally matches the onset of click production to the 'approach phase' echolocation calls produced by aerial hawking attacking bats and that clicks themselves influence the echolocation behaviour of attacking bats. In the context of past research, these findings support the hypotheses that the clicks of arctiid moths are both an active defence (through echolocation disruption) and a reliable indicator of chemical defence against aerial-hawking bats. We suggest these signals are specialized for an aerial context.

AB  - The striking diversity in insect colouration, colour pattern and visual appearance (shape, size, texture or movement) has evolved in response to the needs of communication, both with conspecifics and visually guided predators. The question ‘how are insects viewed by their predators?’ hides a complex set of evolutionary processes, which we review here. In addition to a high taxonomic diversity, insectivorous species substantially differ in their visual performance, the mechanisms and flexibility of their predation behaviour, and how they use visual cues for prey detection, recognition, attack and capture. The large variety of predators' visual systems necessitates a thorough measurement of insect colouration (namely spectrometry and photography) ideally coupled to vision modelling to reconstruct colours as likely perceived by predators. In response to visual selection by predators, insects have evolved different strategies to decrease predation risk, such as camouflage—through disruptive colouration, background matching, countershading, masquerade or motion camouflage—or warning colouration in relation to toxicity. The interplay between insects and predators influences the dynamics of insect populations, an aspect of particular interest in the case of populations showing a colour polymorphism. In a critical review of all these aspects, we identify the visual cues most important for predation, the perceptual processes probably operating in predators, the methodological aspects to improve and the future directions for research. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deep phylogenetic relationships of the largest salamander family Plethodontidae have been difficult to resolve, probably reflecting a rapid diversification early in their evolutionary history. Here, data from 50 independent nuclear markers (total 48,582 bp) are used to reconstruct the phylogeny and divergence times for plethodontid salamanders, using both concatenation and coalescence-based species tree analyses. Our results robustly resolve the position of the enigmatic eastern North American four-toed salamander (Hemidactylium) as the sister taxon of Batrachoseps + Tribe Bolitoglossini, thus settling a long-standing question. Furthermore, we statistically reject sister taxon status of Karsenia and Hydromantes, the only plethodontids to occur outside the Americas, leading us to new biogeographic hypotheses. Contrary to previous long-standing arguments that plethodontid salamanders are an old lineage originating in the Cretaceous (more than 90 Ma), our analyses lead to the hypothesis that these salamanders are much younger, arising close to the K-T boundary (~66 Ma). These time estimates are highly stable using alternative calibration schemes and dating methods. Our data simulation highlights the potential risk of making strong arguments about phylogenetic timing based on inferences from a handful of nuclear genes, a common practice. Based on the newly obtained timetree and ancestral area reconstruction results, we argue that (i) the classic "Out of Appalachia" hypothesis of plethodontid origins is problematic; (ii) the common ancestor of extant plethodontids may have originated in northwestern North America in the early Paleocene; (iii) origins of Eurasian plethodontids likely result from two separate dispersal events from western North America via Beringia in the late Eocene (~42 Ma) and the early Miocene (~23 Ma), respectively. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - We studied a prey-predator system in which both species evolve. We discuss here the conditions that result in coevolution towards a stable equilibrium or towards oscillations. First, we show that a stable equilibrium or population oscillations with small amplitude is likely to occur if the prey's (host's) defence is effective when compared with the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability at equilibrium, whereas large-amplitude oscillations are likely if the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability exceeds the prey's (host's) defensive ability. Second, a stable equilibrium is more likely if the prey's defensive trait evolves faster than the predator's attack trait, whereas population oscillations are likely if the predator's trait evolves faster than that of the prey. Third, when the adaptation rates of both species are similar, the amplitude of the fluctuations in their abundances is small when the adaptation rate is either very slow or very fast, but at an intermediate rate of adaptation the fluctuations have a large amplitude. We also show the case in which the prey's abundance and trait fluctuate greatly, while those of the predator remain almost unchanged. Our results predict that populations and traits in host-parasite systems are more likely than those in prey-predator systems to show large-amplitude oscillations. © 2010 The Royal Society.

AB  - Visual images that convey threatening information can automatically capture attention [1-4]. One example is an object looming in the direction of the observer-presumably because such a stimulus signals an impending collision [5]. A critical question for understanding the relationship between attention and conscious awareness is whether awareness is required for this type of prioritized attentional selection [6]. Although it has been suggested that visual spatial attention can only be affected by consciously perceived events [7], we show that automatic allocation of attention can occur even without conscious awareness of impending threat. We used a visual search task to show that a looming stimulus on a collision path with an observer captures attention but a looming stimulus on a near-miss path does not. Critically, observers were unaware of any difference between collision and near-miss stimuli even when explicitly asked to discriminate between them in separate experiments. These results counter traditional salience-based models of attentional capture, demonstrating that in the absence of perceptual awareness, the visual system can extract behaviorally relevant details from a visual scene and automatically categorize threatening versus nonthreatening images at a level of precision beyond our conscious perceptual capabilities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The attack of the mantid Stagmatoptera biocellata on prey and the defensive responses elicited when this insect is faced with a bird are analysed during all instars. The static component of the strike keeps a constant relationship with the foreleg extension throughout post-embryonic development. The dynamic component seems to keep one fixed relationship with the foreleg length during the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth instars, and another constant relationship during the sixth, seventh, and adult instars. Two defensive systems are shown, i.e. the cryptic reaction and the deimatic reaction. The former is the sole defensive device in the first and second instars; the latter is the sole defensive device in the adult instar. During instars 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 larvae display both reactions. The finding that adults of this species do not present cryptic reactions contrasts with descriptions in mantids of other species. The possible cause of this difference is discussed. The elicitation of the deimatic reaction with a given frequency and the choice between both defensive systems seems to depend on the mantid-foe distance. The general conclusion of the paper is that attack and defence are distance-dependent behaviours in all the instars, but that there is a characteristic distance for each instar that seems to keep a certain relationship with the body size of the insect. © 1973.

AB  - Longfin squid, Loligo pealeii, were exposed to two predators, bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, and summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus, representing cruising and ambush foraging tactics, respectively. During 35 trials, 86 predator-prey interactions were evaluated between bluefish and squid, and in 29 trials, 92 interactions were assessed between flounder and squid. With bluefish, squid predominantly used stay tactics (68.6%, 59/86) as initial responses. The most common stay response was to drop to the bottom, while showing a disruptive body pattern, and remain motionless. In 37.0% (34/92) of interactions with flounder, squid did not detect predators camouflaging on the bottom and showed no reaction prior to being attacked. Squid that did react, used flee tactics more often as initial responses (43.5%, 40/92), including flight with or without inking. When all defence behaviours were considered concurrently, flight was identified as the strongest predictor of squid survival during interactions with each predator. Squid that used flight at any time during an attack sequence had high probabilities of survival with bluefish (65%, 20/31) and flounder (51%, 18/35). The most important deimatic/protean behaviour used by squid was inking. Inking caused bluefish to startle (deimatic) and abandon attacks (probability of survival = 61%, 11/18) and caused flounder to misdirect (protean) attacks towards ink plumes rather than towards squid (probability of survival = 56%, 14/25). These are the first published laboratory experiments to evaluate the survival value of antipredator behaviours in a cephalopod. Results demonstrate that squid vary their defence tactics in response to different predators and that the effectiveness of antipredator behaviours is contingent upon the behavioural characteristics of the predator encountered. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that bioluminescence in firefly larvae (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) functions as an aposematic display. In two experiments, we confirmed the distastefulness of firefly larvae, and tested the hypothesis that a naive, nocturnal predator can learn to use light signals as aposematic cues for avoiding distasteful prey. Larvae were rejected as acceptable prey by 100% of the house mice (Mus musculus) tested. Mice learned to avoid bitter food associated with light cues significantly faster (P = 0.003) than mice presented with food lacking light cues. We conclude that luminescent glowing in firefly larvae meets the requirements of an aposematic signal.

AB  - Some organisms maintain a battery of defensive strategies against their exploiters (predators, parasites or parasitoids), while others fail to employ a defence that seems obvious. In this paper, we shall investigate the circumstances under which defence strategies might be expected to evolve. Brood parasites and their hosts provide our main motivation, and we shall discuss why the reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus has evolved an egg-rejection but not a chick-rejection strategy as a defence against the common (Eurasian) cuckoo Cuculus canorus, while the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus has evolved a chick-rejection but not an egg-rejection strategy as a defence against Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo Chrysococcyx basalis. We suggest that the answers lie in strategy-blocking, where one strategy (the blocking strategy) prevents the appearance of another (the blocked strategy) that would be adaptive in its absence. This may be common in exploiter-victim systems. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: A crucial step in any ethological study is to distinguish and classify the observed behavior into categories. The literature on anuran antipredator mechanisms is largely scattered and descriptive due to the opportunistic nature of the observations and the lack of a simple, widely accepted classification scheme. We propose an explanatory classification system of antipredator mechanisms for post-metamorphic anurans (i.e., juveniles and adults) based on a thorough review of the literature and observations made during fieldwork and in the laboratory since 1970. In addition, we provide a freely available global database on antipredator mechanisms of post-metamorphic anurans. The classification system is composed of 12 antipredator mechanisms and 28 variations distributed into three stages of defense (avoid detection, prevent attack, and counterattack). The database comprises 650 species and 39 families providing a unique opportunity to investigate ecological and evolutionary questions regarding antipredator mechanisms of anuran. We provide a general overview of geographic, taxonomic, and phylogenetic patterns found in the database. Both our studies and that of our colleagues added 70 species to the database. The number of publications on antipredator mechanisms increased substantially after the year 2000. We hope to spark a renewed interest in antipredator mechanisms of post-metamorphic anurans to understand further the evolution of predator–prey interactions. Significance statement: Predation is a phenomenon of great ecological and evolutionary significance. Hence, the study of antipredator mechanisms may provide some of the most fascinating answers to questions regarding species “struggle for existence.” Based on extensive fieldwork, laboratory observations, and a thorough literature survey, we propose a classification system of antipredator mechanisms for anurans and provide a database of antipredator mechanisms elicited by frogs. We describe each mechanism, discuss the variations, and provide images for most antipredator mechanisms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Prey animals can survive a predatory encounter if they communicate unprofitability to an approaching predator. Otherwise undefended prey often use conspicuous deimatic (frightening) displays to intimidate closely approaching predators into delaying or aborting an attack. The 'startle' displays of several insect groups are the best-known example: comprising a sudden size increase coupled with a conspicuous 'eyespot' pattern, these displays can effectively deter highly dangerous avian predators, although they are often unsuccessful. Cephalopods perform remarkably similar visual displays that are presumed to function in the same way, although evidence for this is lacking. Unlike large insects, cephalopods possess rapid escape responses, and seem unlikely to benefit from predator hesitation. Moreover, field and laboratory-based observations with cuttlefish suggest that what has previously been labelled the Deimatic Display may be directed towards small teleosts that pose little or no direct predation risk. In staged encounters between cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, and large predatory fish (sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax and smooth hound Mustelus mustelus), naïve cuttlefish did not perform their Deimatic Display towards large predators, even when spatially constrained and unable to flee. Cuttlefish also discriminated between large predators, selectively using a different visual signal (previously termed the Flamboyant Display) towards the more dangerous teleost fish. These results strongly suggest that, although superficially similar, cephalopod deimatic displays are functionally different to insect displays: large brains and keen senses allow cuttlefish to discriminate between species, and selectively signal to small and only indirectly threatening teleost intruders, rather than highly dangerous predators. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Serial homology is widespread in organismal design, but the origin and individuation of these repeated structures appears to differ with the different types of serial homologues, and remains an intriguing and exciting topic of research. Here I focus on the evolution of the serially repeated eyespots that decorate the margin of the wings of nymphalid butterflies. In this system, unresolved questions relate to the evolutionary steps that lead to the appearance of these serial homologues and how their separate identities evolved. I present and discuss two alternative hypotheses. The first proposes that eyespots first appeared as a row of undifferentiated repeated modules, one per wing compartment, that later become individuated. This individuation allowed eyespots to appear and disappear from specific wing compartments and also allowed eyespots to acquire different morphologies. The second hypothesis proposes that eyespots first appeared as individuated single units, or groups of units, that over evolutionary time were co-opted into new compartments on the wing. I discuss the merits of each of these alternate hypotheses by finding analogies to other systems and propose research avenues for addressing these issues in the future. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Some amphibian larvae develop brightly colored or black tail fins when reared in ponds with predaceous insects. The conspicuous tail has been proposed to lure predator strikes toward the tail and away from the more vulnerable head/body region. We tested this hypothesis by presenting model tadpoles that differed only in coloration to Aeshna dragonfly larvae. The models had either a dark body and pale tail, a dark spot in the middle of the tail, or a dark spot near the tip of the tail. Almost all models with plain tails were struck on the head/body, whereas those with dark spots in the tail were struck significantly more often on the tail. Because living tadpoles survive better when attacked on the tail than on the head, our results show that tail coloration can protect tadpoles from predators at close range.

AB  - Amphibian skin is characterized by the presence of mucous glands, related to cutaneous breathing, reproduction and water balance, and granular glands, related to the production of toxins used in defence. In some species the granular glands can form accumulations in certain regions of the body. This is the case for inguinal macroglands of the leptodactylid frog Physalaemus nattereri, where these structures form a pair of black discs associated with deimatic behaviour. The morphology of the inguinal macroglands and their secretion were studied in this species and correlated to deimatic behaviour. The inguinal macroglands are formed from elongated granular glands that, in contrast with the granular glands of the rest of the skin, have small spherical granules with a proteinic content. In the dermis of the whole body, except for the inguinal macroglands and the inguinal region, a well-developed calcified dermal layer is observed. During deimatic behaviour these macroglands discourage a potential predator from attacking, but if visual cues are insufficient and the predator persists in the attack, a toxic secretion is eliminated in its mouth. This elimination is favoured by the absence of a calcified dermal layer in the macroglands, which makes the dermal region softer than the rest of the dorsal skin. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - The defensive behaviour of 18 species of mantids is described and further details are given of the defences of 12 species whose behaviour was described in an earlier paper. As a result the defences of 37 genera of Ghanaian mantids are now known. Most species of Mantinae have a general resemblance to their background and in Sphodromantis lineola and Miomantis paykullii there is a correlation between colour of background and colour of insect. Most other species of mantid have a highly specific resemblance to bark, grass, sticks or leaves, and the evolution of these insects is discussed. Fire melanism occurs in Galepsus toganus and Pyrgomantis pallida. Evidence is presented which suggests that the selective factor leading to reduction of wings in females of many species is predation by birds. Ten species of mantid have first instars which mimic ants, and in S. lineola first instars are positively associated with Oecophylla, the ant they most closely resemble. Tarachodes afzelii not only has nymphs which resemble ants but it preys extensively on ants as well. The functions of startle displays and the evolution of ocelli in mantids are discussed, and four types of territorial display which result in spacing out of nymphs are described. The defensive behaviour of 18 species of mantids is described in this paper and further details are given of the defences of 12 species whose behaviour was described earlier (Edmunds, 1972). As a result the defences of 37 genera of Ghanaian mantids are now known. Most species of the Mantinae lack a specific resemblance to particular objects but have a green/brown polymorphism, and evidence is presented showing that there is a correlation between background colour and colour of the mantid in Sphodromantis lineola and Miomantis paykullii. Most other species of mantid have a highly specific resemblance to bark, grass, sticks or leaves, and the evolution of these insects is discussed. Fire melanism occurs in Galepsus toganus and Pyrgomantis pallida. Evidence is presented which suggests that wing reduction in females results in decreased predation by birds. Wing reduction gives better primary defence but the wings cannot be completely lost if they are also used for a startle display in secondary defence. Many species of mantid have first instars which mimic ants and the fact that S. lineola first instars have a positive association with the ant Oecophylla indicates that ant mimicry is of defensive importance. Species which have relatively unspecialized adults normally have ant‐mimicking nymphs (e.g. most of the Mantinae), but some species which have highly modified adults do not have ant‐mimicking nymphs, probably because already at the first instar the nymph is “preadapted” to becoming an adult and so cannot resemble an ant. Tarachodes afzelii not only has ant‐mimicking nymphs but also lives amongst and feeds on ants. It has a special technique for knocking off ants which come near it and which it cannot eat. The functions of startle displays and the evolution of ocelli in Pseudo‐creobotra are discussed. Territorial displays which result in spacing out of nymphs are described. These result in reduced cannibalism and they may also serve to partition out the available food resources. Not all mantids have territorial displays, but four different displays have evolved in different species which appear to have this function. Copyright © 1976, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Numerous butterflies have circular patterns called eyespots on their wings. Explanations for their functional value have until recently remained hypothetical. However, several studies in the last few years have supported long-standing hypotheses, and the current paper reviews these recent advances. Large and conspicuous eyespots are thought to be effective by being intimidating to predators and thus reducing predation. This hypothesis has received strong support in different studies. It has been shown that eyespots are intimidating because of their conspicuousness, but experimental support for the idea that eyespots are effective by mimicking vertebrate eyes is at the moment lacking. Studies have also tested the deflection hypothesis, where smaller marginal eyespots are thought to deflect attacks away from the body of the prey, increasing chances of survival with a torn wing. Despite previous negative results, recent work has shown that eyespots can indeed deflect attacks toward themselves under specific conditions. Furthermore, data show that dorsal eyespots are used by males and females as signals during courtship. How the diversity in ventral eyespot patterning has evolved remains a mystery. Future directions and further challenges in understanding the adaptive value of eyespots are discussed. © 2011 The Author.

In spite of remarkable similarities in the production and structure (i.e. spectral energy distribution, short rise and fall times) of these calls, distinct differences between the screams of the ten species studied were found. The percentage of adult individuals producing distress calls is high in Leptodac-tylus pentadactylus (60%), Hyla lanciformis (55%) and Hyla boans (42%). Screaming is far more common in large neotropical species than in their similar sized counterparts in Europe and North America. It appears improbable that distress calls in frogs have evolved as intraspecifìc warning signals. Startling an attacking predator and attraction of secondary predators capable of interfering with a threatening raptor are discussed as possible functions of distress calls. © 1986, BRILL.

AB  - Cuttlefish can rapidly alter their appearance by using neurally controlled chromatophore organs. This ability may provide a window into their cognitive capacity. We test whether the changes in body pattern that occur during hunting depend on context. If they do, then it may be possible to use these changes to study cephalopod cognition while the animal is engaged in ecologically relevant tasks. We found consistent individual differences in the tendency of cuttlefish to hunt with the first two arms raised. We also found that cuttlefish usually darken their skin after they seize a prey item. This darkening is observed regardless of the identity of the prey (fish, crab, or shrimp), prey context (buried in sand, in a bare tank, or on top of a rock pile), or the presence of a sudden stimulus. The sudden stimulus was created by presenting an overhead model bird to the cuttlefish. The model induced components of the Deimatic Display, which is a form of antipredator behavior, suggesting that the model was perceived as a potential threat. Passing Cloud displays and the Darkening of the arms were significantly reduced after exposure to the model bird. The effect of a potential predator on body pattern expression during hunting suggests it may be possible to use these changes as a sensitive indicator of ecologically relevant learning. © 2006 Marine Biological Laboratory.

AB  - Prey use many strategies to avoid being detected by their predators. However, once detected and identified as potentially palatable, prey must employ a second line of defence such as performing a deimatic (startle) display. During the predation sequence, composed of the stages encounter, detection, identification, approach, subjugation and consumption, such defences should be deployed as the predator approaches, but before prey are brought under the predator's control (i.e. before subjugation). We tested this assumption in the mountain katydid (or bush cricket), which is cryptic at rest, but when disturbed flashes spectacular abdominal colours by lifting its wings, and is chemically defended. We experimentally determined which visual, auditory and tactile stimuli trigger their deimatic display via six treatments. Contrary to expectations of the predation sequence katydids required tactile cues before performing their deimatic display, that is, it was performed only after attempted subjugation. Field experiments also showed that katydids perform their deimatic display after experiencing tactile stimuli. Mountain katydid natural history may explain this counterintuitive behaviour. Being slow and cryptic, katydids cannot effect a fast escape after performing their deimatic display but their tough cuticle and chemical defences make survival of initial subjugation attempts likely. Holding their deimatic display until after initial subjugation may prevent continued attack and avoid the potentially large cost of revealing themselves to predators that have not yet noticed them. Performance of deimatic display after subjugation may be more common than currently recognized and we encourage further investigation. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots on butterflywings have been shown to deter predators. This has been traditionally explained by mimicry of vertebrate eyes, but recently the classic eye-mimicry hypothesis has been challenged. It is proposed that the conspicuousness of the eyespot, not mimicry, is what causes aversion due to sensory biases, neophobia or sensory overloads.We conducted an experiment todirectly testwhether the eye-mimicry or the conspicuousness hypothesis better explain eyespot efficacy.We used great tits (Parusmajor) asmodel predator, and tested their reaction towards animated images on a computer display. Birds were tested against images of butterflies without eyespots, with natural-looking eyespots, and manipulated spots with the same contrast but reduced resemblance to an eye, as well as images of predators (owls) with and without eyes. We found that mimetic eyespots were as effective as true eyes of owls and more efficient in eliciting an aversive response than modified, less mimetic but equally contrasting eyespots. We conclude that the eye-mimicry hypothesis explains our results better than the conspicuousness hypothesis and is thus likely to be an important mechanism behind the evolution of butterfly eyespots. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - The production of sound (commonly called stridulation) in spiny lobsters when disturbed by humans is well documented but its function during encounters with natural predators remains largely undocumented. Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus stridulate during tailflip escape attempts in response to grasping of the carapace or antennae by human divers. We hypothesised that stridulating may be effective against predators like octopus which grasp the carapace and antennae during attacks in a way similar to human divers. In this study, we examined defensive sound production during nighttime encounters with Caribbean reef octopus Octopus briareus to determine how P. argus use stridulation and whether it improves survival. In staged nighttime encounters with octopus, lobsters stridulated both during grasping attacks by octopus and after being captured and restrained. Stridulating lobsters escaped from attacking octopuses more frequently and remained uncaptured longer during encounters than experimentally muted individuals. We discuss ecological and evolutionary implications for these data in lobster species that produce sounds when grasped. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.

AB  - Large eyespots on the wings of butterflies and moths have been ascribed generally intimidating qualities by creating a frightening image of a bird or mammal much larger than the insect bearing the eyespots. However, evidence for this anti-predator adaptation has been largely anecdotal and only recently were peacock butterflies, Inachis io, shown to effectively thwart attacks from blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Here, we test whether large eyespots on lepidopterans are generally effective in preventing attacks from small passerines and whether the size of insect or bird can influence the outcome of interactions. We staged experiments between the larger eyed hawkmoths, Smerinthus ocellatus, and the smaller peacock butterflies, I. io, and the larger great tits, Parus major, and the smaller blue tits, P. caeruleus. Survival differed substantially between the insect species with 21 of 24 peacock butterflies, but only 6 of 27 eyed hawkmoths, surviving attacks from the birds. Thus, surprisingly, the smaller prey survived to a higher extent, suggesting that factors other than insect size may be important. However, great tits were less easily intimidated by the insects' eyespots and deimatic behaviour and consumed 16 of 26, but the blue tits only 8 of 25, of the butterflies and hawkmoths. Our results demonstrate that eyespots per se do not guarantee survival and that these two insects bearing equally large eyespots are not equally well protected against predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Animals utilise various strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including camouflage, warning colours and mimicry, and many of these protective signals promote avoidance behaviour in predators. For example, various species possess paired circular 'eyespots', which startle or intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. However, little is known of how the efficacy of such signals relates to the context in which they are found, and no studies have tested the relative effectiveness of anti-predator signals when on otherwise camouflaged and conspicuous prey. We find that the protective value of conspicuous wing spots, placed on artificial moth-like targets presented to wild birds in the field, is strongly affected by the attributes of the prey 'animal' on which they are found. Wing spots reduced predation when on conspicuous prey but were rendered ineffective when on otherwise camouflaged targets, indeed they increased the risk of predation compared to non-marked camouflaged controls. These results demonstrate how different anti-predator strategies may interact, and that protective signals can switch from being beneficial to costly under different contexts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In the herring (Clupea harengus), the swim bladder is connected to both the alimentary canal and the anal opening. The anterior duct is used for filling the swim bladder with air. Gas release from the anal opening is often observed when the fish is scared or during ascent and descent. Here, the sounds produced by such a gas release are studied. The fish was kept in a low-pressure chamber. As the ambient pressure was reduced, the gas in the swim bladder expanded and was emitted through the anal opening. Herring sounds were also recorded in a fish trap and in the field. The characteristic sound made by herring during gas release is denoted as the pulsed chirp. This pulsed chirp is 32-133 ms long (N = 11) and consists of a series of 7-50 (N = 11) transient pulses with a continuous reduction of the frequency emphasis (centroid frequency of first pulse 4.1 kHz and of last pulse 3.0 kHz, N = 11). The source level of the chirp is 73 ± 8 dB re 1 πPa rms (root mean square) at 1 m (N = 19). The pulsed chirp is not known to be produced by any other marine animal and may be a good fingerprint for identifying schools of clupeid fish by natural predators, fishery scientists and fishermen. A model for the generation of the pulsed chirp is presented and tested on existing data. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS and Ifremer/IRD/Inra/Cemagref. All rights reserved.

AB  - The roles of eye camouflage and eyespots are examined within the genus Chaetodon as are the various theories explaining the evolutionary significance of the brilliant colors. While eye camouflage is not common among reef fishes, 91% of the 90 species of Chaetodon, have eyemasks (82) or black heads (4). Eye camouflage occurs concomitantly with diurnal false eyespots in 45.5% (41 of 90) of the species. Diurnal false eyespots serve to misdirect attacks by predators and/or to advertise unpalatability. False eyespots are located on areas of the body which allow escape and survival following an attack. Data suggesting that predators learn about the undesirability of butterflyfishes are presented. Butterflyfishes are inactive at night, forage during the day and spawn at dusk. It is unlikely that nocturnal color changes are useful in conspecific interactions and are therefore believed to provide visual cues to potential predators. Nocturnal eyespots probably function to intimidate potential predators but could also remind them of unpalatability. The aggression release hypothesis (Lorenz 1962, 1966) to explain the brilliant coloration of chaetodontids is not supported because butterflyfish coloration changes and few species are territorial. The species recognition hypothesis (Zumpe 1965) is not supported by results of field experiments. The disruptive coloration hypothesis (Longley 1917) is rejected as a general explanation for poster coloration but does explain the prevalence of eyebars of Chaetodon spp. The aposematic hypothesis (Gosline 1965) is supported by morphology, behavior, a lack of predation and field observations. The possibility of Mullerian mimicry is suggested. It is concluded that the primary selective force behind chaetodontid coloration, particularly eyespots, has been predation and color patterns have evolved to minimize this threat. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - An experimental analysis of predator face recognition was carried out using 360 Chromis caeruleus. Members of this species discriminated between a multicued, two‐dimensional model of a piscivorous fish (Fam. Serranidae) and a typical non‐piscivorous fish (Fam. Acanthuridae). Mouth size and shape were important discriminatory cues. The disruptive pattern of black dots on the face of a piscivorous fish reduced its appropriate recognition by Chromis caeruleus. Um herauszufinden, ob Raubfische von vorn erkannt werden können, wurden Versuche mit 360 Chromis caeruleus, einem im Korallenriff lebenden Fisch, durchgeführt und analysiert. Chromis caeruleus konnte zwischen zweidimensionalen Modellen eines typischen fischfressenden Fisches (Fam. Serranidae) und eines typischen nichtfischfressenden Fisches (Fam. Acanthuridae) unterscheiden. Variationen in Größe und Form des Fischmauls waren wichtigere Unterscheidungsmerkmale als die Augengröße und der Augenabstand. Weiterhin erkannte Chromis caeruleus die Frontalansicht eines fischfressenden Fisches, die durch ein Muster schwarzer Punkte getarnt war, weniger gut. 1982 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - The received view of protective coloration in animals is that conspicuous colors and patterns have evolved because they elicit avoidance behavior in potential predators. In the present study, we examine the spontaneous response of naive predators (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial prey to test the hypothesis that deviations from bilateral symmetry of signaling pattern elements may negatively influence the avoidance-inducing effect of conspicuous color patterns. Chicks displayed stronger aversions to artificial butterflyprey items possessing symmetric color pattern elements than to those possessing asymmetric signals with pattern elements of different color or shape. Although they attacked signals with a size asymmetry of 5% at the same rate as symmetric signals, signals with a size asymmetry of 7.5% or more were attacked more often than were symmetric signals. These results suggest that the protective value of conspicuous color patterns is impaired by asymmetry in color, shape, and size of color pattern elements. Our findings also argue against the notion that animals have inherent preferences for symmetric over asymmetric objects, and demonstrate the existence of a threshold for asymmetry detection, beyond which further increments in asymmetry have no influence on signal efficacy.

AB  - Acoustic signals produced by caterpillars have been documented for over 100 years, but in the majority of cases their significance is unknown. This study is the first to experimentally examine the phenomenon of audible sound production in larval Lepidoptera, focusing on a common silkmoth caterpillar, Antheraea polyphemus (Saturniidae). Larvae produce airborne sounds, resembling 'clicks', with their mandibles. Larvae typically signal multiple times in quick succession, producing trains that last over 1 min and include 50-55 clicks. Individual clicks within a train are on average 24.7 ms in duration, often consisting of multiple components. Clicks are audible in a quiet room, measuring 58.1-78.8 dB peSPL at 10 cm. They exhibit a broadband frequency that extends into the ultrasound spectrum, with most energy between 8 and 18 kHz. Our hypothesis that clicks function as acoustic aposematic signals, was supported by several lines of evidence. Experiments with forceps and domestic chicks correlated sound production with attack, and an increase in attack rate was positively correlated with the number of signals produced. In addition, sound production typically preceded or accompanied defensive regurgitation. Bioassays with invertebrates (ants) and vertebrates (mice) revealed that the regurgitant is deterrent to would-be predators. Comparative evidence revealed that other Bombycoidea species, including Actios luna (Saturniidae) and Manduca sexta (Sphingidae), also produce airborne sounds upon attack, and that these sounds precede regurgitation. The prevalence and adaptive significance of warning sounds in caterpillars is discussed.

AB  - Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The evolution of the extraordinary inflation mechanism of pufferfishes was studied in the light of an independently derived phylogenetic hypothesis of tetraodontiform fishes. Inflation behavior is found in all members of the puffer sister taxa Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae. However, most other tetraodontiform fishes exhibit two functionally similar behaviors. All taxa exhibit a 'coughing' behavior and, with the exception of the sister-group to all other tetraodontiforms, represented by the Triacanthidae, all lineages 'blow' strong jets of water out of their mouth to excavate prey. Functional specializations associated with the three behaviors were identified from anatomical analyses and electromyographic recordings of muscle activity in representatives of the major lineages of the order. The phylogenetic distribution of the three buccal compression behaviors and their functional bases indicates the following: (1) the evolution of inflation behavior involved major structural modifications of the head that function in a novel mechanism that links depression of the floor of the mouth to posterior expansion of the buccal cavity; (2) the contraction patterns of four key head muscles used in the three behaviors are generally similar both across behaviors and taxa: (3) however, the distribution of the two significant modifications of muscle activity are consistent with the hypothesis that the three behaviors represent a transformation series from coughing to water blowing to inflation. The motor pattern for water blowing is a slightly modified version of that seen in coughing, and the inflation motor pattern retains the blowing specialization and adds a single additional modification. The convergent evolution of a poorly developed inflation behavior in at least one genus of filefish provides evidence that tetraodontiform fishes are predisposed to the evolution of this unusual defensive behavior. The presence of a well developed water-blowing behavior in most tetraodontiform lineages may represent an intermediate functional specialization that increased the probability of the evolution of inflation.

AB  - The simple auditory system of noctuoid moths has long been a model for anti-predator studies in neuroethology, although these ears have rarely been experimentally stimulated by the sounds they would encounter from naturally attacking bats. We exposed the ears of five noctuoid moth species to the pre-recorded echolocation calls of an attacking bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to observe the acoustic encoding of the receptors at this critical time in their defensive behaviour. The B cell is a non-tympanal receptor common to all moths that has been suggested to respond to sound, but we found no evidence of this and suggest that its acoustic responsiveness is an artifact arising from its proprioceptive function. The A1 cell, the most sensitive tympanal receptor in noctuid and arctiid moths and the only auditory receptor in notodontid moths, encodes the attack calls with a bursting firing pattern to a point approximately 150 ms from when the bat would have captured the moth. At this point, the firing of the A1 cell reduces to a non-bursting pattern with longer inter-spike periods, suggesting that the moth may no longer express the erratic flight used to escape very close bats. This may be simply due to the absence of selection pressure on moths for auditory tracking of bat echolocation calls beyond this point. Alternatively, the reduced firing may be due to the acoustic characteristics of attack calls in the terminal phase and an acoustic maneuver used by the bat to facilitate its capture of the moth. Although the role of less sensitive A2 cell remains uncertain in the evasive flight responses of moths it may act as a trigger in eliciting sound production, a close-range anti-bat behaviour in the tiger moth, Cycnia tenera.

AB  - Many lepidopteran caterpillars appear to gain protection from insect-eating birds because they possess eyespots, a pair of conspicuous markings on the body generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator. Similarly, many caterpillars widen their anterior body segments when threatened, and this defensive posture may also deter attack because it emphasizes the caterpillar's eyes and/or allows the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely. Yet, given that this behaviour is not limited to caterpillars with eyespots, it is possible that the defensive posture may serve as a predator deterrent in itself. To disentangle the protective value of eyespots and widened anterior body segments, we created four types of artificial caterpillar in a 2×2 factorial design and deployed them on tree branches in the field where they were exposed to predation attempts by wild birds. The 'survivorship' of the artificial caterpillars was monitored over 90. h in six locations. We found a clear survival advantage for artificial prey with eyespots or a widened head shape. However, prey possessing both eyespots and a widened head did not survive longer than prey with either characteristic alone, suggesting that the traits did not act synergistically to deter attack. Interestingly though, only caterpillars in the eyespot-defensive posture treatment received more pecks directed towards the anterior 'head' region. Collectively, this study demonstrates clearly that caterpillars possessing either eyespots or widened anterior body segments are likely to experience reduced predation by wild birds, even at northern latitudes where there are relatively few arboreal snakes. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The processes governing the evolution of sexual dimorphism provided a foundation for sexual selection theory. Two alternative processes, originally proposed by Darwin and Wallace, differ primarily in the timing of events creating the dimorphism. In the process advocated by Darwin, a novel ornament arises in a single sex, with no temporal separation in the origin and sex-limitation of the novel trait. By contrast, Wallace proposed a process where novel ornaments appear simultaneously in both sexes, but are then converted into sex-limited expression by natural selection acting against showy coloration in one sex. Here, we investigate these alternative modes of sexual dimorphism evolution in a phylogenetic framework and demonstrate that both processes contribute to dimorphic wing patterns in the butterfly genera Bicyclus and Junonia. In some lineages, eyespots and bands arise in a single sex, whereas in other lineages they appear in both sexes but are then lost in one of the sexes. In addition, lineages displaying sexual dimorphism were more likely to become sexually monomorphic than they were to remain dimorphic. This derived monomorphism was either owing to a loss of the ornament ('drab monomorphism') or owing to a gain of the same ornament by the opposite sex ('mutual ornamentation'). Our results demonstrate the necessity of a plurality in theories explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism within and across taxa. The origins and evolutionary fate of sexual dimorphism are probably influenced by underlying genetic architecture responsible for sex-limited expression and the degree of intralocus sexual conflict. Future comparative and developmental work on sexual dimorphism within and among taxa will provide a better understanding of the biases and constraints governing the evolution of animal sexual dimorphism. © 2011 The Royal Society.

AB  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are a phenotypically coordinated array of scales whose color is determined as cellular interpretation outputs for morphogenic signals. Here we investigated distribution patterns of scale shape and size in relation to position and coloration on the hindwings of a nymphalid butterfly Junonia orithya. Most scales had a smooth edge but scales at and near the natural and ectopic eyespot foci and in the postbasal area were jagged. Scale size decreased regularly from the postbasal to distal areas, and eyespots occasionally had larger scales than the background. Reasonable correlations were obtained between the eyespot size and focal scale size in females. Histological and real-time individual observations of the color-pattern developmental sequence showed that the background brown and blue colors expanded from the postbasal to distal areas independently from the color-pattern elements such as eyespots. These data suggest that morphogenic signals for coloration directly or indirectly influence the scale shape and size and that the blue "background" is organized by a long-range signal from an unidentified organizing center in J. orithya. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Butterflies that hibernate exhibit particularly efficient defence against predation. A first line of defence is crypsis, and most hibernating butterflies are leaf mimics. When discovered, some species have a second line of defence; the peacock, I. io, when attacked by a predator flicks its wings open exposing large eyespots and performs an intimidating threat display. Here we test the hypothesis that butterflies relying solely on leaf mimicking and butterflies with an intimidating wing pattern, when attacked, exhibit different behavioural suites - because leaf mimicking is best implemented by immobility, whereas intimidating coloration is best implemented by intimidating behaviour. In laboratory experiments blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were allowed 40 min to attack single individuals of three species of butterfly: one relying solely on crypsis, the comma, Polygonia c-album; one relying on intimidating wing pattern in addition to crypsis, the peacock; and one intermediate species, the small tortoiseshell Aglais urticae. The results are in accordance with expectations and demonstrate that: (1) birds take longer to discover the leaf mimicking species, the comma, than the tortoiseshell and the peacock; (2) the comma remained motionless throughout experimental trials but small tortoise-shells and peacocks flicked their wings when attacked; (3) the most intimidating butterfly, the peacock, started flicking its wings at a greater distance from the attacking bird than the small tortoiseshell; and (4) the intimidating pattern and behaviour of peacocks was effective - when discovered, all peacocks survived interactions with blue tits, whereas only 22% of commas and 8% of small tortoiseshells survived. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - The two main species intermingled in a brood of the 17-year cicada (Magicicada) have distinctive sound-making patterns and correspondingly different hearing abilities. Thus, they are acoustically isolated for mating purposes. Their simultaneous emergence and community "singing" has the important advantage of repelling predators.

AB  - Caterpillar defenses have been researched extensively, and, although most studies focus on visually communicated signals, little is known about the role that sounds play in defense. We report on whistling, a novel form of sound production for caterpillars and rare for insects in general. The North American walnut sphinx (Amorpha juglandis) produces whistle 'trains' ranging from 44 to 2060.ms in duration and comprising one to eight whistles. Sounds were categorized into three types: broadband, pure whistles and multi-harmonic plus broadband, with mean dominant frequencies at 15.kHz, 9.kHz and 22.kHz, respectively. The mechanism of sound production was determined by selectively obstructing abdominal spiracles, monitoring air flow at different spiracles using a laser vibrometer and recording body movements associated with sound production using high-speed video. Contractions of the anterior body segments always accompanied sound production, forcing air through a pair of enlarged spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. We tested the hypothesis that sounds function in defense using simulated attacks with blunt forceps and natural attacks with an avian predator - the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia). In simulated attacks, 94% of caterpillars responded with whistle trains that were frequently accompanied by directed thrashing but no obvious chemical defense. In predator trials, all birds readily attacked the caterpillar, eliciting whistle trains each time. Birds responded to whistling by hesitating, jumping back or diving away from the sound source. We conclude that caterpillar whistles are defensive and propose that they function specifically as acoustic 'eye spots' to startle predators. © 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Few studies of venomous snakes have addressed how anti-predator behavior may be affected by experience with a potential predator. Because defensive strikes may be costly to snakes, individuals with the ability to learn to discriminate among potentially harmful and non-harmful predatory stimuli should be favored by natural selection. In large venomous snakes, adults are capable of successfully defending themselves against most potential predators, whereas neonates suffer higher predator-induced mortality and are faced with a large diversity of predators. Consequently, we hypothesized that the relative costs of habituation to potential predatory stimuli should vary ontogenetically. This hypothesis predicts that adults should habituate rapidly to non-harmful predatory stimuli, whereas neonates should consistently employ active defensive displays (e.g. striking) because they are at higher risk. To test this prediction, we examined daily changes in the defensive behavior of adult and neonate cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) towards a standardized non-harmful predatory stimulus. As predicted, adults and neonates differed in their tendencies to habituate: adults decreased defensiveness over days while neonates did not. Adults showed habituation of striking components but not of warning displays. Our results support the hypothesis that there may be ontogenetic differences in predator perception. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.

AB  - When startled, some animals reduce ventilation rate and heart rate, and become motionless. The function of this response, if any, remains unknown. We used non-invasive ultrasound imaging to monitor the ventilatory, cardiac and postural responses of cuttlefish exposed to sudden visual stimuli. Simultaneously, we recorded cuttlefish behaviour using an overhead video camera. Upon presentation of the sudden visual stimulus (rapidly approaching bird cut-out), cuttlefish rapidly changed the colour and the texture of their skin, taking on characteristics of the Deimatic Display. Cuttlefish also became motionless (behavioural freezing), hyperinflated their mantles, and decreased their ventilation rate and heart rate. We found no evidence of a relationship between the intensity of the Deimatic Display and the intensity of any other measured parameter. Ventilation rate decreased during behavioural freezing. Hyperinflation of the mantle was most intense in preparation for and during behavioural freezing. Heart rate decreases occurred during mantle hyperinflation and were greatest in animals showing the most hyperinflation. Decreased heart rate may not be adaptive per se. Instead, it might be a product of the unusual arrangement of the cuttlefish peripheral vasculature, which could be compressed during mantle hyperinflation. By filling the mantle with water (hyperinflation), this response to sudden stimuli may help cuttlefish prepare for possible flight by jet propulsion, which often follows the Deimatic Display.

AB  - Background: Many animals reduce the risk of being attacked by a predator through crypsis, masquerade or, alternatively, by advertising unprofitability by means of aposematic signalling. Behavioural attributes in prey employed after discovery, however, signify the importance of also having an effective secondary defence if a predator uncovers, or is immune to, the prey's primary defence. In butterflies, as in most animals, secondary defence generally consists of escape flights. However, some butterfly species have evolved other means of secondary defence such as deimatic displays/startle displays. The European swallowtail, Papilio machaon, employs what appears to be a startle display by exposing its brightly coloured dorsal wing surface upon disturbance and, if the disturbance continues, by intermittently protracting and relaxing its wing muscles generating a jerky motion of the wings. This display appears directed towards predators but whether it is effective in intimidating predators so that they refrain from attacks has never been tested experimentally. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we staged encounters between a passerine predator, the great tit, Parus major, and live and dead swallowtail butterflies in a two-choice experiment. Results showed that the dead butterfly was virtually always attacked before the live butterfly, and that it took four times longer before a bird attacked the live butterfly. When the live butterfly was approached by a bird this generally elicited the butterfly's startle display, which usually caused the approaching bird to flee. We also performed a palatability test of the butterflies and results show that the great tits seemed to find them palatable. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that the swallowtail's startle display of conspicuous coloration and jerky movements is an efficient secondary defence against small passerines. We also discuss under what conditions predator-prey systems are likely to aid the evolution of deimatic behaviours in harmless and palatable prey. © 2012 Olofsson et al.

AB  - Previous findings suggest differences in the neuroanatomical substrates of short- (seconds) vs longer-duration (minutes) fear responses. We now report that phasic and sustained fear can also be differentiated pharmacologically, based on their response to several treatments that either are or are not clinically effective anxiolytics. For these experiments, short- or long-duration clicker stimuli were paired with footshock. Acoustic startle amplitude was later measured in the absence of the clicker, or within seconds (phasic fear) or minutes (sustained fear) of its onset. Before testing, rats received a single injection of vehicle, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, the 5HT 1A agonist and dopamine D2 antagonist buspirone, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, or a 3-week treatment with either vehicle or fluoxetine. Chlordiazepoxide blocked sustained, but not phasic startle increases. Acute buspirone, which is not anxiolytic in human beings, did not affect sustained startle increases, but did disrupt phasic increases. Chronic fluoxetine blocked sustained startle increases and unreliably reduced phasic increases; acute fluoxetine affected neither. The results indicate that phasic and sustained fear responses can be pharmacologically dissociated, further validating this distinction, and suggest that sustained startle increases may be especially useful as anxiety models and anxiolytic screens. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Thus the great diversity of patterns observed across different species of butterfly has evolved through changes in the genetic modulation of this mechanism.

AB  - Cases of mimicry provide many of the nature's most convincing examples of natural selection. Here we report evidence for a case of predator mimicry in which metalmark moths in the genus Brenthia mimic jumping spiders, one of their predators. In controlled trials, Brenthia had higher survival rates than other similarly sized moths in the presence of jumping spiders and jumping spiders responded to Brenthia with territorial displays, indicating that Brenthia were sometimes mistaken for jumping spiders, and not recognized as prey. Our experimental results and a review of wing patterns of other insects indicate that jumping spider mimicry is more widespread than heretofore appreciated, and that jumping spiders are probably an important selective pressure shaping the evolution of diurnal insects that perch on vegetation. © 2006 Rota, Wagner.

AB  - The color patterns on the wings of butterflies have been an important model system in evolutionary developmental biology. Two types of models have been used to study these patterns. The first type of model employs computational techniques and generalized mechanisms of pattern formation to make predictions about how color patterns will vary as parameters of the model are changed. These generalized mechanisms include diffusion gradient, reaction-diffusion, lateral inhibition, and threshold responses. The second type of model uses known genetic interactions from Drosophila melanogaster and patterns of candidate gene expression in one of several butterfly species (most often Junonia (Precis) coenia or Bicyclus anynana) to propose specific genetic regulatory hierarchies that appear to be involved in color pattern formation. This study combines these two approaches using computational techniques to test proposed genetic regulatory hierarchies for the determination of butterfly eyespot foci (also known as border ocelli foci). Two computer programs, STELLA 8.1 and Delphi 2.0, were used to simulate the determination of eyespot foci. Both programs revealed weaknesses in a genetic model previously proposed for eyespot focus determination. On the basis of these simulations, we propose two revised models for eyespot focus determination and identify components of the genetic regulatory hierarchy that are particularly sensitive to changes in model parameter values. These components may play a key role in the evolution of butterfly eyespots. Simulations like these may be useful tools for the study of other evolutionary developmental model systems and reveal similar sensitive components of the relevant genetic regulatory hierarchies. © 2006 The Author(s).

AB  - Eyespots are concentric motifs with contrasting colours on butterfly wings. Eyespots have intra- and inter-specific visual signalling functions with adaptive and selective roles. We propose a reaction-diffusion model that accounts for eyespot development. The model considers two diffusive morphogens and three non-diffusive pigment precursors. The first morphogen is produced in the focus and determines the differentiation of the first eyespot ring. A second morphogen is then produced, modifying the chromatic properties of the wing background pigment precursor, inducing the differentiation of a second ring. The model simulates the general structural organization of eyespots, their phenotypic plasticity and seasonal variability, and predicts effects from microsurgical manipulations on pupal wings as reported in the literature.

AB  - Variability within the genus Phrynosoma in the occurrence of ocular-sinus blood-squirting, reportedly a defense used in canid encounters, is reviewed from the literature. Six species have been reported to squirt blood, and seven species remain unreported. Five of the latter species were tested in dog trials; one exhibited blood-squirting (Phrynosoma hernandesi), one exhibited precursor behaviors but failed to squirt blood (Phrynosoma ditmarsi), and three yielded negative results (Phrynosoma mcallii, Phrynosoma modestum, and Phrynosoma platyrhinos). Instances of blood-squirting in response to human encounters were collected and largely support the negative results for the three species P. mcallii, P. modestum, and P. platyrhinos. A phylogeny of blood-squirting and nonblood-squirting species is presented with blood-squirting being plesiomorphic in the genus and the synapomorphic condition of nonsquirting species being restricted to a single clade of P. mcallii-modestum-platyrhinos. The possibility of P. douglasii independently evolving an autapomorphic condition remains unresolved. Dog trials with 40 adult Phrynosoma cornutum were conducted to determine influences of body size and sex on squirt frequency and blood mass expelled, as well as to examine aspects of the potential physiological cost of the defense. In 153 trials, 85% of all lizards squirted in at least one trial, 82% squirted in more than one trial, and two lizards squirted daily over the seven-day trial period. Initial body mass positively correlated with the total number of squirts/individual (r2 = 0.28; P &lt; 0.001) and the number of days a lizard continued squirting (r2 = 0.63; P &lt; 0.01). Number of squirts/individual/day declined over the seven-day trial period (r2 = 0.20; P &lt; 0.05). Cumulative mass loss for individual lizards attributable to blood-squirting averaged 0.7 ± 0.8 g (2.0 ± 2.0% body mass), with a high of 2.8 g (6.8% body mass). In addition, juvenile P. cornutum and P. hernandesi were shown to squirt blood in dog trials, illustrating the early developmental onset of the behavior.

AB  - Sound production in two undescribed species of Gryllacrididae belonging to the genus Ametrus sp. and Hadrogryllacris sp. takes the form of defensive stridulation and intra-specific signalling by drumming on the substrate. Defensive stridulation is produced as part of an elaborate visual display, by femoro-tergal stridulation. Two rows of spines on abdominal tergites II and III of both species are rubbed by an elongate area of tubercules on the inner femoral surface of the hind legs. Analysis showed that the motion of the leg relative to the abdomen involves a complex counter-rotation of the leg between leg and abdomen. The defensive display may be performed in day light. Social signalling in both species occurs after dark, and involves drumming on the substrate by both hind legs in loose synchrony. Drumming is rhythmic and species' specific. Males respond to playback calls and females duet with males. The evolution of this calling behaviour is discussed and comparisons are made with the other primitive ensiferan family known to produce both tergo-abdominal defensive stridulation and femoral drumming behaviour, the Stenopelmatidae. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The development of electric organs (EO) in the electric ray, Torpedo marmorata, is described. Four pairs of electric nerves contact the branchiomeric mesoderm layer, which produces four pairs of EO primordia (at about the stage of 21-mm total body length, 70-mg weight). These are the sites of column genesis, yielding the definitive column number at the stage of 25-27 mm (200-250 mg), and growing together on each side of the pharynx. Columns are composed of myotubes, each containing one myofibril and several nuclei. During the 35- to 55-mm stages (0.7 - 2.5 g), these "electroblasts" dedifferentiate, each giving rise to one electroplate derived only from its ventral half ["plate builder" (PB)]. Plate genesis appears as a perfectly synchronized process, involving coordinated changes of cell shape. The occurrence of cell fusions is not ruled out. At the same time, some individual contacts of PB with nerve fibers are seen. Reflex electric organ discharge (EOD) appears at the stages of 66-73 mm (6-7 g), when only a few nerve ending-like membrane enclosures are present and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) begins to accumulate. The parallel courses of EOD maturation, synaptogenesis, and AChE accumulation are described. © 1978.

AB  - Eyespots (colour patterns consisting of concentric rings) are found in a wide range of animal taxa and are often assumed to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have found strong evidence for an intimidating effect of eyespots against passerine birds. Some eyespots have been suggested to increase prey survival by diverting attacks towards less vital body parts or a direction that would facilitate escape. While eyespots in aquatic environments are widespread, their function is extremely understudied. Therefore, we investigated the protective function of eyespots against attacking fish. We used artificial prey and predator-naive three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as predators to test both the diversion (deflection) and the intimidation hypothesis. Interestingly, our results showed that eyespots smaller than the fish' own eye very effectively draw the attacks of the fish towards them. Furthermore, our experiment also showed that this was not due to the conspicuousness of the eyespot, because attack latency did not differ between prey items with and without eyespots. We found little support for an intimidating effect by larger eyespots. Even though also other markings might misdirect attacks, we can conclude that the misdirecting function may have played an important role in the evolution of eyespots in aquatic environments. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots have evolved in multiple taxa and presumably function to thwart predator attacks. Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to simply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted over. Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - Experiments in humans have shown that changes in emotional (affective) state cause adaptive changes in the processing of incoming information, termed "cognitive bias". For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with "pessimistic" judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling "threat call" (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds' behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our understanding of the evolution of display as a conflict strategy derives from extensive theoretical and empirical studies of non-social animals. Surprisingly, such an approach has seldom been adopted for the study of social insects. In this study, we explored the circumstances under which meat ants (Iridomyrmex purpureus) display or engage in potentially lethal fights. Colonies of meat ants establish territories in which the boundaries are lined by workers engaged in ritual displays. Although more common, ritual displays are not the only means of resolving conflicts in meat ants; sometimes fights are fierce and result in injury or death. We show, using field experiments, that when two ants engage in fierce fighting, it is most often the territory-defending ant which initiated the behaviour, while ritual displays are more often initiated by the intruding ant. The fighting behaviour of the ants was not influenced by the absolute or relative size of the combatants, nor by the presence or absence of large, temporary food sources. Mandibles of fighting ants collected on conflict zones had a higher degree of wear than those of foragers, suggesting that fighting ants are the older, more dispensable individuals of the colony. Our data indicate that factors in addition to nestmate recognition may mediate the outcome of confrontations in social insects. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2005.

AB  - The "deflection hypothesis" asserts that conspicuous marginal patches on insect wings function to deflect predator attacks toward such patches and away from more vital body parts. As a result of selection from predator attacks, these marks are predicted to increase the probability of escape by tearing relatively easily. To test if a conspicuous marginal patch is weak relative to a homologous wing area without such a patch, hindwing tear weight was compared among three Pierella species (Satyrinae) differing in the presence of a conspicuous patch in the hindwing tornus. The species with a conspicuous white hindwing patch (P. astyoche) had significantly lower tear weights than the two species lacking the patch (P. lamia and P. lena). Forewing length did not explain variation in wing-tear weight, but wing-tear weight was positively related to insect age in a manner consistent with the deflection hypothesis. Older individuals of P. lamia and P. lena had higher tear weight, whereas this relationship was absent in P. astyoche. These results represent the first direct evidence that deflection marks on butterfly wings are relatively weak and should have an increased tendency to tear when handled by a predator.

AB  - Whereas humans have three types of cone photoreceptor, birds have four types of single cones and, unlike humans, are sensitive to ultraviolet light (UV, 320-400nm). Most birds are thought to have either a violet-sensitive single cone that has some sensitivity to UV wavelengths (for example, many non-passerine species) or a single cone that has maximum sensitivity to UV (for example, oscine passerine species). UV sensitivity is possible because, unlike humans, avian ocular media do not absorb UV light before it reaches the retina. The different single cone types and their sensitivity to UV light give birds the potential to discriminate reflectance spectra that look identical to humans. It is clear that birds use UV signals for a number of visual tasks, but there are few studies that directly demonstrate a role for UV in the detection of chromaticity differences (i.e. colour vision) as opposed to achromatic brightness. If the output of the violet/UV cone is used in achromatic visual tasks, objects reflecting more UV will appear brighter to the bird. If, however, the output is used in a chromatic mechanism, birds will be able to discriminate spectral stimuli according to the amount of reflected light in the UV part of the spectrum relative to longer wavelengths. We have developed a UV 'colour blindness' test, which we have given to a passerine (European starling) and a non-passerine (Japanese quail) species. Both species learnt to discriminate between a longwave control of orange vs red stimuli and UV vs 'non-UV' stimuli, which were designed to be impossible to differentiate by achromatic mechanisms. We therefore conclude that the output of the violet/UV cone is involved in a chromatic colour vision system in these two species.

AB  - Mobility, activity patterns, habitat use, and some morphological traits of two often cooccurring satyrine butterflies of grasslands - the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) and the hedge brown (Pyronia tithonus) - were studied by a mark-release-recapture method at two sites. Additionally, some flight-related morphological traits of a series of collected females of P. tithonus were compared between recently colonized and permanent populations. The more active, but less mobile P. tithonus got faster wing damage than did M. jurtina and had more, and more symmetrically spread eyespots on the wings. For both species, the microdistribution was affected by shelter, long vegetation, and nectar, but this was more pronounced in P. tithonus. It is hypothesized that P. tithonus may traverse the same landscape at a slower rate than M. jurtina.

AB  - Our understanding of deceit in animal signalling is limited by our conceptual tools as well as by the available data. Mate choice in polyterritorial birds, such as pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, is a particularly contentious example. Dale & Slagsvold (1994, Anim. Behav., 48, 1207-1217) developed a quantitative model of discrimination of male quality (mating status) based on repeated sampling of territories by searching females. The model emphasizes the trade-off between correctly rejecting already mated males and incorrectly rejecting unmated males. In the present study, their model was incorporated into the framework of signal detection theory and the relationship between search costs, search tactics and the resulting rates of discrimination errors was examined. Over a range of reasonable assumptions about probabilities and payoffs, the scenario suggested by Dale & Slagsvold implies that female pied flycatchers should inspect each territory only a few times and accept only males that are present at every inspection. Consequently, male mating status should be moderately discriminable. The quantitative tools offered by signal detection theory are consistent with the conceptualization of deceit established by Dawkins & Krebs (1978, Behavioural Ecology: An Evolutionary Approach) and with the recent evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analyses of signalling developed by Johnstone & Grafen (1992, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B, 248, 229-233). © 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The behaviour of the paradise fish in the presence of either a living pike or catfish or various dummies or a catfish equipped with a pair of artificial big eyes was studied. Analyzing the first encounter two separate periods of the predator recognition process could be identified. The primary form of the antipredatory reaction was orientation (looking at the object while keeping a constant eye and body position) which was elicited by any fish‐like bodies but not by bare eyes without a body. During orientation the presence of pike or catfish equipped with artificial eyes or a dummy with horizontal eyes elicited fin erecting display. This reaction was sporadic in the presence of a normal catfish which has very small eyes. The biological significance of this separate organization of exploration is discussed. 1990 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90. h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Predation experiments have shown that the large eyespots (concentric rings of contrasting colors) found on the wings of several lepidopteran species intimidate passerine predators. According to the eye mimicry hypotheses, the intimidation is caused by predators associating the eyespots with the presence (of the eyes) of their own enemy. The conspicuousness hypothesis suggests, instead, that it is simply the conspicuousness of eyespot patterns that is intimidating, possibly due to a sensory bias. We studied how the number of eyespots, 2 or 4, influences intimidation. We predicted that if eye mimicry is important, the maximum response would be reached with a pair of eyespots. On the other hand, if conspicuousness is important, then more than 2 eyespots should result in an even stronger response. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, has 4 large eyespots on its wings. We presented naïve insectivorous birds (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca) 2 different prey items made from wings of dead peacock butterflies and a mealworm between the wings. One group of birds received prey that had no or only 2 eyespots visible and the other group received prey that had no or all 4 eyespots visible. Eyespots clearly increased hesitation before attacks. Because the birds were naïve, this difference in response to the eyespots was innate. Importantly, there was no difference in attack latency between 2 and 4 eyespots. We conclude that it is unlikely that conspicuousness as such has selected for eyespots in the peacock butterfly. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - Eyespots (patterns of roughly concentric rings) are often thought to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have lent support for the intimidation hypothesis by demonstrating a deterring effect of eyespots, but so far there is little evidence for the deflective effect (direction of attacks toward less vital body parts). We studied predators' responses towards large and small eyespots and towards prey with no, one, or a pair of eyespots and if this response is influenced by whether or not prey blend into background. In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators. In experiment 1, we found evidence for the deflective effect of small but not large eyespots, independent of whether the prey was presented on a concealing or exposing background. In experiment 2, we found that predators avoided the prey with a pair of small eyespots more than the prey without eyespots, but interestingly, we only found this deterring effect on the concealing background. There was no difference in attacks between the prey with one large and two small or one large and no eyespots. We conclude that deflective function may select for eyespots, and background may influence the deterring function of eyespots. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, normally possesses circular eyespots on its wings. Artificial selection lines, which express ellipsoidal eyespots on the dorsal surface of the forewing, were used to investigate correlated changes in wing shape. Morphometric analysis of linear wing measurements and wing scale counts provided evidence that eyespot shape was correlated with localised shape changes in the corresponding wing-cell, with overall shape changes in the wing, and with the density/arrangement of scales around the eyespot area.

AB  - Dittrich recently proposed that the existence of hoverfly species which are 'imperfect' mimics of wasps is a consequence of a constraint on the perceptual or learning mechanisms of birds. Here we put forward a new theory of the evolution of the 'imperfect mimics'. We propose that the apparent imperfection should be regarded as either true ambiguity, in which the vertebrate predator has difficulty in interpreting the meaning of two equally probable messages, or as the presentation of a sign in an incongruous context, which also interferes with the interpretation of the meaning of the message. In either case, the lengthening of the perceptual process will give the prey opportunity to escape. We term this satyric mimicry in reference to the ambiguity or paradox involved. We suggest explanations for the experimental results of Dittrich and briefly discuss the importance of satyric mimicry in the evolution of Batesian mimicry.

AB  - Artificial moth models were presented to caged blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, in order to investigate the effectiveness of deimatic displays in underwing (Catocala: Noctuidae) moths. The models had flexible, patterned 'hindwings' which were concealed behind cardboard 'forewings' until the birds removed them from a presentation board. Jays which had been trained on models with grey hindwings exhibited a startle response when they were exposed to Catocala-patterned hindwings. In contrast to this, subjects trained on Catocala models did not startle to a novel grey hindwing. The startle response to Catocala patterns lasted over several days until birds habituated to the models. When the jays had habituated to one Catocala hindwing pattern, a novel Catocala pattern always elicited a startle response. Familiar Catocala hindwing patterns which appeared in an anomalous context (i.e., associated with a different forewing pattern) also evoked a startle response from these birds. Novelty, oddity, conspicuousness, and anomaly are considered as possible stimulus characteristics which trigger the startle response. © 1985.

AB  - Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are more hesitant to continue attacking and take longer to kill and eat stridulating passalid beetles (Odontotaenius disjunctus) than silenced beetles. This is an experimental demonstration of the deterrent capability of disturbance stridulation by an insect that has no active defences against the predator. Stridulation is not necessary for congregation by colony members. Silenced beetles congregate as effectively as controls. There is no evidence that the disturbance stridulation causes predictable responses in other colony members of this presocial beetle. © 1981.

AB  - The ability of a species to defend itself against a predator is directly correlated with its survivorship. Thus, prey/predator interaction mechanisms are important elements of the natural history of species. In this study, we examined the defensive repertoire of the South-American hognose snake (Xenodon dorbignyi) through simulations of predator attacks in the field. Nine defensive displays were observed. The most frequently observed displays were erratic movements, body flattening, head triangulation and tail display. No differences were detected in the defensive strategies shown by males and females, regardless of their reproductive state. Our findings suggest that X. dorbignyi has the ability to evaluate the level of threat imposed by the aggressor, with cryptic behavior, body flattening and locomotor escape as the primary defensive strategies, with other displays used as secondary responses to a predator attack. Our results support the hypothesis that X. dorbignyi is a mimic of both Micrurus and Bothrops.

AB  - Feeding experiments with lizards are used to examine the function of small eyespot markings found along the wing margins of many butterfly species. Such eyespots are frequently suggested to function by deflecting the attacks of vertebrate predators away from the vulnerable body towards the wing margins, which can tear easily; the eyespots are considered to mislead predators and to act as targets for their attacks. Such misdirected attacks give the butterflies a chance to evade capture, albeit sometimes losing pieces of wing tissue. As a model prey species, we used fruit-feeding individuals of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana that were attacked in a standard way in laboratory cages by the anolis lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We also manipulated the butterflies' wing patterns by pasting eyespots on different parts of the wings to examine the deflection hypothesis in more detail. Our results indicate no influence on the lizard attacks either of the presence of eyespots, or of their position on the wings. The lizards attacked butterflies in a highly stereotyped manner both when the prey were presented on matching or on contrasting backgrounds. We thus found no support for the deflection hypothesis for attacks by insectivorous lizards. Indeed, our only support to date has been obtained for naïve flycatcher birds, but even this requires further corroboration. Although effective deflection may occur rather infrequently, except perhaps under certain ecological conditions such as high-density feeding of butterflies on fallen fruit, it may still be sufficiently consistent over time to have contributed to shaping the evolution of marginal eyespot patterns. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Some authors have suggested that prey species stand to benefit most by defending as early as possible during predator-prey encounters, but species in nature employ antipredator defenses at various stages of interactions with their predators. Whether it is generally most advantageous to defend early or late during such encounters is an open theoretical question. We model conditions under which a prey species might evolve early or late defenses in response to predation. Adapting a two-prey, one-predator Rosenzweig- MacArthur system of differential equations, we analyze the effects of modified antipredator defenses (and their associated costs) on the ability of a new prey type to invade the one-prey, one-predator limiting system at equilibrium. We show that the outcome, in terms of invasion potential, is crucially dependent on the ratio of the prey's proportional population growth rate to the cost of predator encounters. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Predation acts as a selective pressure, driving prey adaptation. Predators can also evolve counter-defenses to increase the likelihood of successful attack. Investment in either trait can be costly, leading to a trade-off between the traits and other fitness components. Costs for defense have been shown experimentally to depend on environmental factors such as resource availability. This suggests that costs can increase with population size, rather than remaining constant as models often assume. Using a quantitative trait model with predator-prey coevolution, we investigate how both population and trait dynamics are affected by density-dependent prey defense cost ('variable cost') vs. density-independent cost ('fixed cost'). We assume predator counter-defense cost is always density independent. We also investigate the effect of relative speeds of prey and predator evolution on population and trait dynamics, by varying a parameter that determines each population's additive genetic variance. For both models, increasing the speed of predator evolution always has a stabilizing effect on the dynamics, while increasing the speed of prey evolution (within a biologically reasonable range) is largely destabilizing. Within the plausible range of prey evolution speed, variable cost of prey defense is more stabilizing than fixed cost. Our results suggest that density-dependent costs of defense can have important effects on predator-prey dynamics, even when evolution is relatively slow. Our results might also help to explain why many real populations do not display predator-prey cycles. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Bioluminescent flashing in fireflies, while primarily a sexual signal, is known to deter some predators while attracting others. We tested whether flashing serves an antipredator function against two species of diurnal, visually hunting jumping spiders, Phidippus princeps and Phidippus audax. To confirm anecdotal reports that fireflies flash during the day in a nonmating context, we documented that adult fireflies (Photuris sp.) of both sexes flash when disturbed in daylight. We also confirmed that activity periods of Phidippus and fireflies overlap, and that spiders attack fireflies and elicit flashing behaviour. We conducted three experiments to examine the influence of flashing on spider behaviour. (1) We tested whether the sudden onset of a flashing LED startled spiders that had initiated attacks on crickets, and found no evidence that it did so. (2) We used choice tests to determine whether flashing lights attracted or deterred spiders from attacking palatable prey. Spiders more often attacked crickets positioned next to a flashing LED versus an LED that was either off or glowed steadily. (3) Many firefly species are distasteful. Therefore, we tested whether flashing lights facilitate avoidance of unpalatable prey with experience. Spiders were given seven encounters with unpalatable prey (nonluminescent Ellychnia corrusca fireflies) associated with either flashing or unlit LEDs. Spiders in the two treatments were equally likely to attack the prey during their first encounter, but spiders exposed to flashing LEDs were significantly less likely to attack unpalatable prey by their seventh trial. Spiders tested with palatable prey showed no decline in attacks after exposure to flashing LEDs. We conclude that, although bioluminescent flash signals may increase attack rates by predatory jumping spiders, they may also facilitate learning about unpalatable prey. Thus, the costs and benefits of flashing may depend on the prevalence of firefly palatability. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The salience of bilateral symmetry to humans has led to the suggestion that camouflage may be enhanced in asymmetrical patterns. However, the importance of bilateral symmetry in visual signals (and overall morphology) may constrain the evolution of asymmetrical camouflage, resulting in the bilaterally symmetrical cryptic patterns that we see throughout the animal kingdom. This study investigates the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), which can control the degree of symmetry in its coloration. Ten juvenile S. officinalis were filmed in two behavioural contexts (cryptic and threatened) to test the prediction that cryptic patterns will be expressed more asymmetrically than an anti-predator signal known as the 'deimatic display'. Cryptic body patterns, particularly those with a disruptive function, were found to exhibit a high degree of bilateral symmetry. By contrast, the components of the deimatic display were often expressed asymmetrically. These results are contrary to the predicted use of symmetry in defensive coloration, indicating that the role of symmetry in both crypsis and visual signalling is not as straightforward as previously suggested. © 2005 The Royal Society.

AB  - The acoustic startle reflex (ASR), a defensive response, is a contraction of the skeletal and facial muscles in response to an abrupt, intense (>80 db) auditory stimulus, which has been extensively studied in rats and humans. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR is the normal suppression of the startle reflex when an intense stimulus is preceded by a weak non-starting pre-stimulus. PPI, a measure of sensory motor gating, is impaired in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, and is modulated by cognitive and emotional contexts such as fear and attention. We have modeled the fear modulation of PPI of ASR based on its anatomical substrates and taking into account data from behaving rats and humans. The model replicates the principal features of both phenomena and predicts underlying neural mechanisms. In addition, the model yields testable predictions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Many snakes, particularly cobras, form as part of a defensive display, a hood, an active lateral expansion of their neck skin and underlying musculature and ribs. We identified muscle groups possibly involved in hooding based on their attachments on the specialized ribs of the neck. We then used a combination of morphology, kinematic analysis, morphometries, electromyography and muscle stimulation to test hypotheses about the functional basis of hooding. We confirmed that hood protraction and erection is an active process that begins cranially and extends caudally, often in stages, through the combined action of several sets of muscles. One set of axial muscles (levator costae and supracostalis lateralis superior) coursing along a line of action to rib displacement are the prime erectors acting to lift the hood. However, a second set of muscles connecting ribs to skin primarily keep the skin taut, rather than to displace the ribs relative to the vertebrae. A third set of muscles coursing between ribs function primarily to transmit forces between adjacent ribs rather than to move ribs. The maintenance of the erect hood requires continued muscle activity. Hood relaxation is due to both active muscle contraction of a fourth set of axial muscles and to passive recoil events in the costovertebral ligaments. The shape of the fully erect hood is reflective of the morphometries of the underlying ribs, while the duration and kinematics of hood erection and relaxation are related to the behavioral context of the display. ©2010.

AB  - Leaf-borne vibrations are potentially important to caterpillars for communication and risk assessment. Yet, little is known about the vibratory environment of caterpillars, or how they detect and discriminate between vibrations from relevant and non-relevant sources. We measured the vibratory 'landscape' of the territorial masked birch caterpillar Drepana arcuata (Drepanidae), and assessed its ability to detect and respond to vibrations generated by conspecific and predatory intruders, wind and rain. Residents of leaf shelters were shown to respond to low amplitude vibrations generated by a crawling conspecific intruder, since removal of the vibrations through leaf incision prevented the resident's response. Residents did not respond to large amplitude, low frequency disturbances caused by wind and rain alone, but did respond to approaching conspecifics under windy conditions, indicating an ability to discriminate between these sources. Residents also responded differently in the presence of vibrations generated by approaching predators (Podisus) and conspecifics. An analysis of vibration characteristics suggests that despite significant overlap between vibrations from different sources, there are differences in frequency and amplitude characteristics that caterpillars may use to discriminate between sources. Caterpillars live in a vibration-rich environment that we argue forms a prominent part of the sensory world of substrate bound holometabolous larvae. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Many defended animals prevent attacks by displaying warning signals that are highly conspicuous to their predators. We hypothesized that bioluminescing fireflies, widely known for their vibrant courtship signals, also advertise their noxiousness to echolocating bats. To test this postulate, we pit naïve big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) against chemically defended fireflies (Photinus pyralis) to examine whether and how these beetles transmit salient warnings to bats. We demonstrate that these nocturnal predators learn to avoid noxious fireflies using either vision or echolocation and that bats learn faster when integrating information from both sensory streams—providing fundamental evidence that multisensory integration increases the efficacy of warning signals in a natural predator-prey system. Our findings add support for a warning signal origin of firefly bioluminescence and suggest that bat predation may have driven evolution of firefly bioluminescence. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Flash behavior, in which otherwise cryptic prey exhibit conspicuous coloration or noise when fleeing from potential predators, has been postulated to hinder location of prey once they become stationary. Here, using artificial computer-generated prey and humans as visual predators, we show that human subjects are more likely to abandon their search for prey that flash, compared to continuously cryptic fleeing controls. Survivorship of flashing prey was an additional 20% higher than the survivorship of continuously cryptic prey, depending on the background against which it was depicted. This survivorship advantage was consistent regardless of whether prey showed flash colors continuously or intermittently during flight. The advantage over continuously cryptic prey was highest when the flashing prey was presented first. Likewise, the more search areas containing no prey that the volunteers had initially viewed, the more likely they were to give up when there was a cryptic prey present. Collectively, these 3 findings indicate that volunteers inferred the flashing prey was absent from the search area when they failed to see a prey in the same form as they saw it move. Our results demonstrate first proof of concept: flash behavior, widely seen in taxa from insects to mammals, is an effective antipredator escape mechanism. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Many cryptic prey have also evolved hidden contrasting colour signals which are displayed to would-be predators. Given that these hidden contrasting signals may confer additional survival benefits to the prey by startling/intimidating predators, it is unclear why they have evolved in some species, but not in others. Here, we have conducted a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of colour traits in the family Erebidae (Lepidoptera), and found that the hidden contrasting colour signals are more likely to be found in larger species. To understand why this relationship occurs, we present a general mathematical model, demonstrating that selection for a secondary defence such as deimatic display will be stronger in large species when (i) the primary defence (crypsis) is likely to fail as its body size increases and/or (ii) the secondary defence is more effective in large prey. To test the model assumptions, we conducted behavioural experiments using a robotic moth which revealed that survivorship advantages were higher against wild birds when the moth has contrasting hindwings and large size. Collectively, our results suggest that the evolutionary association between large size and hidden contrasting signals has been driven by a combination of the need for a back-up defence and its efficacy. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Caterpillars have many natural enemies and, therefore, have evolved a diversity of antipredator strategies. Most research focuses on those strategies (crypsis, countershading, and warning coloration) targeting visually guided predators. In contrast, defensive sounds, although documented for more than a century, have been poorly studied. We report on a novel form of sound production-chirping-in caterpillars of the common European Great Peacock moth (Saturnia pyri). Chirps are broadband, with dominant peaks ranging between the sonic (3.7 kHz) and ultrasonic (55.1 kHz) and are generated by a rapid succession of mandibular "tooth strikes." Chirp trains are induced by simulated predator attacks and precede or accompany the secretion of a defensive chemical from integumental bristles, supporting our hypothesis that these sounds function in acoustic aposematism. We propose that these caterpillars generate multimodal warning signals (visual, chemical, and acoustic) to target the dominant sensory modalities of different predators, including birds, bats, and invertebrates. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Conspicuous sonic click sounds were recorded in the presence of cod (Gadus morhua), together with either harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) or a human diver in a pool. Similar sounds were never recorded in the presence of salmon (Salmo salar) together with either seal species, or from either seal or fish species when kept separately in the pool. It is concluded that cod was the source of these sounds and that the clicks were produced only when cod were approached by a swimming predatorlike body. The analyzed click sounds (n = 377) had the following characteristics (overall averages ± S.D.): peak frequency = 5.95 ± 2.22 kHz; peak-to-peak duration = 0.70 ± 0.45 ms; sound pressure level (received level) = 153.2 ± 7.0 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m. At present the mechanism and purpose of these clicks is not known. However, the circumstances under which they were recorded and some observations on the behavior of the seals both suggest that the clicks could have a predator startling function. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Both emotion and attention are known to influence the startle response. Stress influences emotion and attention, but the impact of stress on the human startle response remains unclear. We used an established physiological stressor, the Cold Pressor Test (CPT), to induce stress in a non-clinical human sample (24 student participants) in a within-subjects design. Autonomic (heart rate and skin conductance) and somatic (eye blink) responses to acoustic startle probes were measured during a pre-stress baseline, during a three minutes stress intervention, and during the subsequent recovery period. Startle skin conductance and heart rate responses were facilitated during stress. Compared to baseline, startle eye blink responses were not affected during the intervention but were diminished afterwards. These data describe a new and unique startle response pattern during stress: facilitation of autonomic stress responses but no such facilitation of somatic startle eye blink responses. The absence of an effect of stress on startle eye blink responsiveness may illustrate the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted visual input during periods of stress. © 2012 Deuter et al.

AB  - Many species of lepidoptera bear conspicuous circular patterns on their wings, known as eyespots, that are hypothesised to protect their bearers against predatory birds. In this study, we focus on a small but ubiquitous feature occurring naturally in lepidopteran eyespots, namely the so-called 'sparkle'. The 'pupil' in an eyespot is often highlighted by a 'sparkle', which is hypothesised to mimic a natural corneal total light reflection evident as a highlight, twinkle, or sparkle in the vertebrate eye. In a study exploring the presence of such sparkles, we found that 53% of lepidopteran eyespots exceeding 1mm in diameter have a central, pinpoint-like 'sparkle', 12% have a marginal, crescent-shaped 'sparkle', 13% have a semi-circular 'sparkle', and 22% have an intermediate semi-circular to crescent-shaped 'sparkle'. In the lepidopterans' natural resting position, the marginal 'sparkles' are positioned in the upper part of the eyespots''pupil' and thus may create the illusion of a spherical eyeball. The 'sparkles' in lepidopteran eyespots do not only appear white to humans, but also reflect ultraviolet light. White and UV-reflecting 'sparkles' also appear 'white' for UV-sensitive viewers such as birds, and thus may effectively mimic the natural highlight in vertebrate eyes as an area of total light reflection. In field experiments using lepidopteran dummies baited with a mealworm, we show that the 'sparkle' is one of several components of eyespots eliciting a deterrent effect and that eyespots with a 'sparkle' in a natural position have a stronger deterrent effect than those with a 'sparkle' in an unnatural position. These findings support the eye mimicry hypothesis that better vertebrate eye mimicry improves the deterrent effect of eyespots. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - A morphometric analysis of 20 different facial features of reef fishes was carried out in order to assess cues which could serve for predator recognition. 105 different species of 35 different families were included in this study. The main features of potential discriminatory value were head width, head shape, the size of the mouth and its shape, the shape of the eyes, their diameter, and the distance between the eyes. Color and pattern were of no potential discriminatory value. Discriminant function analysis showed that two cues, the distance between the eyes and the size of the mouth, were sufficient for good predator recognition. The camouflage of piscivorous cues by predatory fish is discussed. The mimicry of piscivorous cues by some prey fishes as an anti‐predator strategy is suggested for two types of false eye spots simulating the frontal aspect of a piscivore. 1981 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Anti-predator strategies are significant components of adaptation in prey species. Aposematic prey are expected to possess effective defences that have evolved simultaneously with their warning colours. This study tested the hypothesis of the defensive function and ecological significance of the hard body in aposematic Pachyrhynchus weevils pioneered by Alfred Russel Wallace nearly 150 years ago. We used predation trials with Japalura tree lizards to assess the survivorship of 'hard' (mature) versus 'soft' (teneral) and 'clawed' (intact) versus 'clawless' (surgically removed) weevils. The ecological significance of the weevil's hard body was evaluated by assessing the hardness of the weevils, the local prey insects, and the bite forces of the lizard populations. The existence of toxins or deterrents in the weevil was examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All 'hard' weevils were instantly spat out after being bitten once and survived attacks by the lizards. In contrast, the 'soft' weevils were chewed and subsequently swallowed. The results were the same regardless of the presence or absence of the weevil's tarsal claws. The hardness of 'hard' Pachyrhynchus weevils was significantly higher than the average hardness of other prey insects in the same habitat and the mean bite forces of the local lizards. The four candidate compounds of the weevil identified by GC-MS had no known toxic or repellent functions against vertebrates. These results reveal that the hardness of aposematic prey functions as an effective secondary defence, and they provide a framework for understanding the spatio-temporal interactions between vertebrate predators and aposematic insect prey. © 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - The defensive behavior of snakes towards humans has been well documented. Ironically, many of these early studies focused on harmless colubrid species. Knowledge of venomous snake defensive behavior is limited, and further research is necessary to understand how pitvipers react to human confrontations. I performed laboratory tests daily over a period of five days to investigate whether cottonmouths would habituate to handling. Eleven days after the last habituation test, snakes were tested again to see if cottonmouths show a recovery response. Cottonmouths exhibited a significant change in defensive behavior between Day 1 and Day 5 of the experiment. However, they did not significantly revert to their original behavior 11 days later.

AB  - The signalling role of asymmetry has attracted considerable recent interest among evolutionary biologists. Although it has been studied primarily within the context of sexual selection, symmetry of signals may play a role also in inter-specific communication, such as predator-prey interactions. Both theory and experimental evidence suggest that asymmetry may impair the efficacy of visual warning signals used to deter potential predators, but increase the protective value of non-signalling, cryptic colour patterns used to decrease the risk of detection. Here we tested the prediction from this hypothesis by means of intra-individual comparisons of asymmetry in colour pattern elements in three species of moths (Arctia caja (L.), Noctua orbona (L.), Smerinthus ocellata (L.)) that possess cryptic fore wing patterns and signalling hind wing patterns. Mean asymmetries constituted 4.3% (range 2.1-7.0%) of trait size for colour pattern elements, whereas individual asymmetry levels reached as high as 26%. Asymmetry tended to be somewhat larger in cryptic patterns on fore wings than in signalling patterns on hind wings in five of six comparisons, but in only one case was the difference statistically significant. In addition, pattern elements were somewhat more asymmetric on fore wings also in Saturnia pavonia (L.), which possesses identical signalling eyespots on both fore and hind wings. The relatively low levels of asymmetry also in cryptic patterns imply either that selection does not favour increased asymmetry in cryptic patterns, or that the evolution of pronounced asymmetry is developmentally or genetically constrained.

AB  - Theory about the role of constraints in evolution is abundant, but few empirical data exist to describe the consequences a bias in phenotypic variation has for micro evolution. Responses to natural selection can be severely hampered by a genetic correlation among a suite of traits. Constraints can be studied using antagonistic selection experiments, that is, two-trait selection in opposition to this correlation. The two traits studied here were development time and wing pattern (eyespot size) in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, both of which have a clear adaptive significance. Rates of response were higher for eyespot size than for development time, but were independent of the concurrent selection (either in the same direction as the correlation or perpendicular to it). Regimes differed in both traits in all directions after 11 generations of selection. The uncoupling lines had higher relative responses than the synergistic lines in development time and equal relative responses in eyespot size. The patterns for eyespot size (reaction norms) were consistent across different rearing temperatures. Differences in lines selected for fast and slow development time were more pronounced at lower temperatures, irrespective of the direction of joint wing pattern selection. Furthermore, correlated responses in pupal weight and growth rate were observed; lines selected for a slower development had higher pupal weights, especially at lower temperatures. The response of the uncoupling lines was not hampered by a lack of selectable genetic variation, and the relative response in the development time was larger than expected based on response in the coupled direction and quantitative genetic predictions. This suggests that the structure of the genetic architecture does not constrain the short-term, independent evolution of both wing pattern and development time.

AB  - Visual pigments initiate vision and are characterized by their wavelengths of maximal absorption (λmax). Modifications of the λmax values of visual pigments have allowed organisms to adapt to diverse light environments. The availability of the functional assays of these visual pigments using cultured cells makes vision an ideal genetic system to study the molecular bases of adaptation and genetics of color vision in vertebrates. The visual pigments in vertebrate retinas are distinguished into five evolutionarily distinct groups RH1 (λmax = 490-500 nm), RH2 (470-510 nm), SWS1 (360-420 nm), SWS2 (440-455), and LWS/MWS (510-570 nm). Here, we review amino acid replacements that are associated with the shifts in the λmax values of these visual pigments. The λmax-shifts in several RH1 pigments seem to reflect adaptive changes to blue environments of the organisms and are explained mostly by amino acid replacements D83N (D → N at residue 83), E122Q, and A292S. Similarly, the blue-shifts in the λmax values of the RH2 pigments can be explained by D83N, E122Q, A164S, and M207L. For the SWS1 pigments of birds, only one amino acid replacement S84C seems to be responsible for the transformation of ultraviolet pigments from the violet pigment. For the LWS/MWS pigments, the additive effects of amino acid differences at 180, 197, 277, 285, and 308 fully explain the red-green color vision in a wide range of vertebrates. All of these observations suggest that the evolution of the extant visual pigments can be explained by amino acid replacements at only a small number of sites. Visual pigments, a group of G- protein-coupled receptors, initiate visual excitation (Wald 1968). Each visual pigment consists of a transmembrane protein, opsin, and the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and can be characterized by its wavelength of maximal absorption (λmax). Human color vision is mediated by 'blue', 'green', and 'red' visual pigments. The 'blue' pigments absorb wavelengths ranging from about 370 nm to 570 nm with a λmax at 420 nm, while both 'green' and 'red' pigments are sensitive to wavelength about 450-620 nm with λmax values at 530 nm and 560 nm, respectively (Nathans 1989). The molecular bases of the spectral tuning of these and other visual pigments in vertebrates are still not well understood. Recently, however, some significant progress has been made on this subject. To evaluate the mechanisms of the functional properties of visual pigments, a large number of amino acid changes have been introduced into the bovine rod-specific visual pigment (rhodopsin) by several groups of vision scientists (for a review, see Yokoyama 1997). In most of these analyses, charged amino acids have been considered. For example, an amino acid change from glutamic acid at residue 113 (E113) to glutamine (E113Q) shifts the λmax of the pigment from 500 nm to 380 nm (Sakmar et al. 1989; Zhukovsky and Oprian 1989; Nathans 1990a, b). E113 is the negatively charged counterion to the positively charged protonated Schiff base and the modification of this opsin structure causes a drastic shift in the λmax value of the pigment. Unfortunately, most of these amino acid changes, including E113Q, have not been found in nature. Thus, it is not immediately clear how these mutagenesis results are helpful in elucidating the molecular basis for the divergence of λmax values of visual pigments in nature (Yokoyama 1995, 1997). Fortunately, molecular evolutionary methods often alleviate this problem (Yokoyama and Yokoyama 1990; Yokoyama 1995, 1997; Yokoyama et al. 1999). By analyzing visual pigment sequence data, we can identify potentially important amino acid replacements that may shift the λmax values. Importantly, these hypotheses can be tested rigorously by conducting mutagenesis experiments. Since we study the processes of functional adaptation of visual pigments to various photic environments, the analyses will also elucidate natural selection at the molecular level. In the following, I shall review such analyses by considering dim vision, ultraviolet (UV) vision, and red-green color vision.

AB  - Squid utilize an array of complex anti-predator behaviors, which provide advantages to avoid high predation pressure. Although there are morphological and ecological differences among paralarval, juvenile and adult squid, no studies have examined how anti-predator behavior changes through life history stages in cephalopods. The goal of this study was to (1) document how anti-predator behavior in squid changes throughout ontogeny and (2) measure kinematic variables associated with squid-predator interactions to analyze the behavioral cues that trigger anti-predator responses. Anti-predator responses in squid were studied in a series of predator-prey trials using high-speed videography. All life histories of squid exhibited some escape jetting in response to predators, but paralarvae exhibited far fewer escape responses relative to juveniles and adults, and did not demonstrate posturing or inking behavior. For 65% of the interactions, paralarvae used stereotyped behaviors such as swimming in repetitive circles and spirals, rather than escape jetting, and clear body patterning during predator encounters. Inking responses in juveniles and adults were associated with significantly higher predator approach velocities and closer predator-squid distances when compared with postural responses. Older squid were more likely to demonstrate the banded body pattern, and the 'pseudomorph' ink shape was most commonly used. The observed differences in anti-predator behavior throughout ontogeny indicate that paralarvae rely on stereotyped swimming behaviors and translucent coloration to avoid capture, while juvenile and adults use kinematic cues of the predator approach to determine whether posturing, inking and escape jetting, or a combination of the two is the most suitable anti-predator behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - While superstitions appear maladaptive, they may be the inevitable result of an adaptive causal learning mechanism that simultaneously reduces the risk of two types of errors: the error of failing to exploit an existing causal relationship and the error of trying to exploit a nonexistent causal relationship. An individual's exploration-exploitation strategy is a key component of managing this trade-off. In particular, on any given trial, the individual must decide whether to give the action that maximizes its expected fitness based on current information (exploit) or to give the action that provides the most information about the true nature of the causal relationship (explore). We present a version of this 'two-armed bandit' problem that allows us to identify the optimal exploration-exploitation strategy, and to determine how various parameters affect the probability that an individual will develop a superstition. We find that superstitions are more likely when the cost of the superstition is low relative to the perceived benefits, and when the individual's prior beliefs suggest that the superstition is true. Furthermore, we find that both the total number of learning trials available, and the nature of the individual's uncertainty affect the probability of superstition, but that the nature of these effects depends on the individual's prior beliefs. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Blue jays were used in laboratory experiments to determine what visual characteristics of Catocala hindwings are important in eliciting and maintaining startle reactions in avian predators. Hand-reared blue jays, inexperienced with warningly coloured, inedible prey, took significantly longer to touch novel colours that possessed bold, black bands than to touch novel, unbanded colours when these discs covered a food reward. Thus, being conspicuous (as opposed to simply being novel) appears to enhance startle reactions. Bold patterns are commonly found on aposematic prey and Catocala hindwings. These same hand-reared birds also tended to take longer to touch novel coloured discs of yellow and red hues as opposed to discs of blue, green, or purple hues. The colours that produced the greatest hesitation are similar to the colours found on Catocala hindwings. Red-yellow colours are also characteristic of aposematic prey. Wild-caught birds took longer to habituate to startling stimuli when presented with several different startling disc types during the habituation process. Thus, predator pressure may explain why several different Catocala species with different hindwing colours occur sympatrically. © 1993, Brill. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organisms face the cognitive challenge of making decisions based on imperfect information. Predators and prey, in particular, are confronted with ambiguous stimuli when foraging and avoiding attacks. These challenges are accentuated by variation imposed by environmental, physiological, and cognitive factors. While the cognitive factors influencing perceived ambiguity are often assumed to be fixed, contemporary findings reveal that perceived ambiguity is instead the dynamic outcome of interactive cognitive processes. Here, we present a framework that integrates recent advances in neurophysiology and sensory ecology with a classic decision-making model, signal detection theory (SDT), to understand the cognitive mechanisms that shape perceived stimulus ambiguity in predators and prey. Since stimulus ambiguity is pervasive, the framework discussed here provides insights that extend into nonforaging contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While there have been a number of recent advances in our understanding of the evolution of animal color patterns, much of this work has focused on color patterns that are constantly displayed. How-ever, some animals hide functional color signals and display them only transiently through behavioral displays. These displays are widely em-ployed as a secondary defense following detection when fleeing (flash display) or when stationary (deimatic display). Yet if displays of hidden colors are so effective in deterring predation, why have not all species evolved them? An earlier study suggested that the hidden antipredatory color signals in insects are more likely to have evolved in species with large size because either (or both) (i) large cryptic prey are more fre-quently detected and pursued or (ii) hidden color signals in large prey are more effective in deterring predation than in small prey. These ar-guments should apply universally to any prey that use hidden signals, so the association between large size and hidden contrasting color signals should be evident across diverse groups of prey. In this study, we tested this prediction in five different groups of insects. Using phylogenetically controlled analysis to elucidate the relationship between body size and color contrast between forewings and hind wings, we found evidence for the predicted size-color contrast associations in four different groups of insects, namely, Orthoptera, Phasmatidae, Mantidae, and Saturniidae, but not in Sphingidae. Collectively, our study indicates that body size plays an important role in explaining variation in the evolution of hidden contrasting color signals in insects. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Concludes that 1) novelty facilitates visually-mediated taste-avoidance learning in chicks; and 2) the failure of chicks to discriminate a novel palatable fluid from a familiar unpalatable one depends on the relative novelty of the palatable fluid and not on the relative familiarity of the unpalatable one. Results are discussed in the context of warning coloration and are explained in terms of an interaction between unlearned and learned avoidance tendencies. -from Author

AB  - The frogs of the g&nusLeiopelma exhibit characteristic antipredator behaviours. All three living species utter squeaks or chirps when annoyed. The acoustic structure of the vocalisations varied between individuals within a species. Vocalisations probably serve no function for intraspecific communication. Under duress, the terrestrial species, L. hamiltoni and L. archeyi, both assumed a stifflegged stance while rearing up, extended the legs, raised the body, and butted the head. The more aquatic species, L. hochstetteri, did not assume so rigid a head-butting stance as it rarely raised its body or extended its legs. This species was more apt to try to escape. These behavioural differences correlated with differential distributions of defensive granular glands in the skin. The glands were concentrated into discrete dorsal patches arranged in six longitudinal rows in L. hamiltoni and L. archeyi. The anterior end of the middle row terminates in what has been termed a parotoid gland. In L. hochstetteri, the granular glands were distributed diffusely over the sides and belly and were sparse or absent from the dorsum. Head-butting and the presence of dorsal gland concentrations in L. hamiltoni andL. archeyi are correlated components of an antipredator defense adapted for terrestrial life. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Stridulation in the Coleoptera has repeatedly been suggested as a defence mechanism. This hypothesis was examined in a natural predator‐prey relationship. In the experiment individuals of Elaphrus riparius L. with or without chirping ability were offered to 3 Common Sand Pipers (Actitis hypoleucos). Stridulating beetles were released more often and swallowed less spontaneously. In approximately 20% of the captures the beetles discharge their pygidial defence glands. The stridulation behaviour therefore is interpreted as a warning signal — comparable to warning colours — which is associated with defence secretion. Die Abwehrwirkung der Stridulationsgeräusche von Elaphrus riparius L. (Coleoptera, Carabidae) gegenüber einem natürlichen Feind, Actitis hypoleucos (Aves) wurde experimentell untersucht. Den Vögeln wurden Käfer mit und ohne Zirpvermögen geboten und der Einfluß der Stridulation auf ihr Verhalten beobachtet. E. riparius beginnt zu zirpen, wenn er von dem Vogel mit dem Schnabel ergriffen wird. Zirpende Käfer wurden im Versuch häufiger wieder frei gelassen als nicht zirpende. Wurden sie dennoch gefressen, so dauerte das vorangehende Tötungsverhalten der Vögel gegenüber zirpenden Käfern länger. Auf dieselben Reize und gleichzeitig mit der Stridulation geben die Käfer manchmal Wehrsekrete ab. Die Untersuchung dieses Abwehrverhaltens zeigte, daß die Sekretabgabe in Menge und Häufigkeit bei den Käfern individuell stark variiert. Insgesamt erfolgte sie in ca. 20% aller Fälle, in denen striduliert wurde. Die Stridulation von Elaphrus riparius wird als Warnverhalten gedeutet, das erst im Augenblick der Berührung durch einen Feind abläuft. Die Schutzwirkung besteht in einer Verblüffung des Angreifers und/oder darin, daß der Angreifer das Geräusch mit der Abgabe von Wehrsekret assoziiert. 1976 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Warning signals protect unpalatable prey from predation because predators who learn the association between the warning signal and prey unprofitability decrease attacks on the prey. Most of the research have focused on visual aposematic signals that are constantly presented and visible to the predators. But a variety of chemically defended insects are rather cryptic when resting, and only in response to predator attacks (post-attack) they perform displays of conspicuous abdomens or hindwings normally hidden under forewings. The function of those displays in unpalatable insects is not well understood. We examined two adaptive hypotheses on this facultative aposematic display using wild-caught oriental tits (Parus minor) as predators. First, we tested whether the display increases the rejection of the prey by predators upon seeing the display (i.e., at the moment of attack) through learning trials (aposematic signaling hypothesis). Second, we tested whether the display facilitates the memory formation between cryptic visible form of the prey and prey defense so that it prevents the predators initiate an attack upon seeing the cryptic form (facilitation hypothesis). We found that predators learned to avoid attacking the prey which supports the facilitation hypothesis. However, the support for the aposematic signaling hypothesis was equivocal. Our results open new directions of research by highlighting the possibility that similar facilitation effects may contribute to the evolution of various forms of post-attack visual displays in chemically, or otherwise, defended animals. © 2016 Kang, Cho, Lee and Jablonski.

AB  - In responses to looming objects, the praying mantis shows a defense behavior, which consists of retracting forelegs under the prothorax. The role of a loomingsensitive neuron in triggering this behavior was investigated by simultaneously recording the activity and behavioral responses of the neuron. The mantis initiated the defense behavior earlier in response to larger and slower looming stimuli. The time remaining to collision at defense initiation was linearly correlated with the ratio of the half-size of an approaching object to its speed (l/|v|), suggesting that the defense behavior occurred a fixed delay after the stimuli had reached a fixed angular threshold. Furthermore, the results suggested that high-frequency spikes of the looming-sensitive neuron were involved in triggering the defense behavior: the distribution of maximum firing rate for trials with defense was shifted to larger rates compared with trials without defense; the firing rate of the neuron exceeded 150 Hz ~100 ms before the defense initiation regardless of stimulus parameters; when a looming stimulus ceased approach prematurely, high-frequency spikes were removed, and the occurrence of defense was reduced. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Many animals are marked with conspicuous circular features often called 'eyespots', which intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. It has long been assumed that eyespots work by mimicking the eyes of larger animals, but recent experiments have indicated that conspicuousness and contrast is important in eyespot function, and not eye mimicry. We undertake two further experiments to distinguish between the conspicuousness and mimicry hypotheses, by using artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field. In experiment 1, we test if eyespot effectiveness depends on the marking shape (bar or circle) and arrangement (eye-like and non- eye-like positions). We find no difference between shapes or arrangement; all spots were equally effective in scaring birds. In experiment 2, we test if the often yellow and black colors of eyespots mimic the eyes of birds of prey. We find no effect of shape, and no advantage to yellow and black spots over non-eye-like but equally conspicuous colors. The consistent finding is that eyespot function lies in being a conspicuous signal to predators, and not necessarily due to eye mimicry. © 2009 Current Zoology.

AB  - Eyespots have long been thought to confer protection against predators, but empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these markings and their survival value in the wild is limited. Using a mark-recapture experiment, I examined the functional significance of the eyespot on the dorsal fin of a juvenile tropical fish to its survival on coral reefs. None of the juveniles recaptured 1 month after settlement showed evidence of bite marks on the posterior region of the bodies to suggest a deflective function of their eyespot. When I compared the survivors with recruits from the same settlement cohort, I detected no change in the frequency distribution of eyespot size, suggesting no selective pressure operating on this trait. I compared these survivors with conspecifics from the same cohort collected at settlement and then outgrown in the absence of predators under 3 food regimes and 2 levels of intraspecific competition. I found that the eyespots of wild juveniles were larger overall than those of conspecifics maintained in a predator-free environment. The results of this study indicate that larger eyespots per se do not confer a survival advantage in the wild, suggesting that eyespots of this species may not have the long-assumed antipredatory function but play a role in interactions with adult conspecifics. I suggest that juveniles maintain eyespots even when predators or adult conspecifics are absent because they can be afforded at very low costs and may still be beneficial to their bearer under specific ecological conditions. © The Author 2008.

AB  - Neophobia, or the fear of novel objects, is a behavior that is often found in wild animals. Neophobia appears to be related to the physiological stress response because individuals with higher glucocorticoid responses to stress often are more neophobic. The relationship between the heart rate response and novelty, however, has not been tested in a wild species. We implanted heart rate transmitters in captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to measure increases in heart rate as an index of the adrenomedullary stress response. Specifically, we measured heart rate in animals encountering novel objects on or near their food dishes using a system to display the novel objects while the experimenters remained outside the room, thereby minimizing the confounding effects of experimenter presence on heart rate. We analyzed three conditions: the period of adjustment to the experimental setup before any exposure to novelty, novel object trials, and no object controls (presented in a random order after 0-5 novel objects). Birds approached their food dishes faster during the adjustment period than during novel object trials. Although they demonstrated a behavioral aversion to novelty, the effect on heart rate was unexpected. Heart rate increased sharply when the food dishes were displayed. The duration of the startle response was longer during no object controls than during novel object exposure, the opposite of the anticipated result. There were no correlations between behavior and metrics of the heart rate response. Novel object exposure does not cause an increase in heart rate. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The defensive glandular apparatus of primitive bombardier beetles of the tribe Crepidogastrini (Carabidae) is described for the first time. As exemplified by two African species (Crepidogaster ambreana and C. atrata), the apparatus conforms to the basic bombardier plan, in that the glands are bicompartmented and the secretion is quinonoid (it contains 1,4-benzoquinones and hydrocarbons), hot, and discharged audibly. In a number of morphological respects the crepidogastrine apparatus resembles that of the classical bombardiers of the tribe Brachinini (rather than that of bombardiers of the paussoid lineage), reinforcing the view, already held on taxonomic grounds, that the Crepidogastrini and Brachinini are closely related. That the Crepidogastrini may be primitive relative to Brachinini is underscored by the finding that, unlike brachinines, crepidogastrines do not pulse their secretory emissions. Moreover, they discharge their secretion as a mist, rather than forcibly in the form of jets.

AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of phenethyl alcohol (PEA), eyespots, magnetic fields, and avian-predator effigies to deter European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) from nesting in artificial cavities in Ohio during 1993, 1995, and 1996. Each year, 81 nest boxes attached to utility poles were assigned at random equally among 3 treatments (including control): 1993 - PEA or eyespots, 1995 - magnetic fields of 88 or 118 gauss, and 1996 - great horned owl or merlin effigy. Starlings nested in 84% (1993), 58% (1995), and 90% (1996) of the boxes. There was no difference (P ≥ 0.13) among treatments each year in 6-7 measures of starling nesting activity. Four species other than starlings (eastern bluebirds [Sialia sialis], house wrens [Troglodytes aedon], tree swallows [Tachycineta bicolor], and house sparrows [Passer domesticus]) occupied 13 (1993), 23 (1995), and 2 (1996) nest boxes. We conclude that PEA, eyespots, magnetic fields ≤118 gauss, and avian-predator effigies are ineffective as deterrents for starlings nesting in artificial cavities.

AB  - 1. (1) Megaloblatta blaberoides nymphs stridulate in response to disturbance. Sounds are produced by rubbing a pair of bilateral ventral files on the sixth sternum across opposing stationary scrapers located laterodorsally on the fifth sternum. The forward-moving file on one side and the backward-moving contralateral file generate sound simultaneously. 2. (2) Intact nymphs produce a broad frequency band noise (5-35 kHz). Due to superposition of signals and silent pauses produced by the bilateral organs, no regular pattern of amplitude modulation is measurable. The sound produced by unilaterally muted nymphs contains regular pulse-train groups (forward and back cycle) each of which is divided into a short forward motion and a longer backward motion. These are interrupted by a short pause. A longer pause occurs prior to the anteriorly directed motion of the intact file. 3. (3) Megaloblatta's proteinaceous tergal secretion is chemically and physically similar to that of Blatta orientalis. Coupling of acoustic warning, bright colour patterns, and chemical defence constitutes a multi-modal aposematic display which may be effective both nocturnally and diurnally against potential predators. © 1982.

AB  - In the context of mental disorders sensory overload is a widely described phenomenon used in conjunction with psychiatric interventions such as removal from stimuli. However, the theoretical foundation of sensory overload as addressed in the literature can be described as insufficient and fragmentary. To date, the concept of sensory overload has not yet been sufficiently specified or analyzed. The aim of the study was to analyze the concept of sensory overload in mental health care. A literature search was undertaken using specific electronic databases, specific journals and websites, hand searches, specific library catalogues, and electronic publishing databases. Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis was used to analyze the sources included in the analysis. All aspects of the method of Walker and Avant were covered in this concept analysis. The conceptual understanding has become more focused, the defining attributes, influencing factors and consequences are described and empirical referents identified. The concept analysis is a first step in the development of a middle-range descriptive theory of sensory overload based on social scientific and stress-theoretical approaches. This specification may serve as a fundament for further research, for the development of a nursing diagnosis or for guidelines. © 2017 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.

AB  - 1. Aposematic coloration in prey promotes its survival by conspicuously advertising unpalatability to predators. Although classical examples of aposematic signals involve constant presentation of a signal at a distance, some animals suddenly display warning colours only when they are attacked. 2. Characteristics of body parts suddenly displayed, such as conspicuous coloration or eyespot pattern, may increase the survival of the prey by startling the predator, and/or by signalling unpalatability to the predators at the moment of attack. 3. The adaptive value of such colour patterns suddenly displayed by unpalatable prey has not been studied. We experimentally blackened the red patch in the conspicuous red-white-black hindwing pattern displayed by an unpalatable insect Lycorma delicatula White (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) in response to predator's attack. 4. There was no evidence that the presence of the red patch increased prey survival over several weeks. We hypothesise that predators generalised from the red-white-black patches on the hindwings of unpalatable L. delicatula to any similar wing display as a signal of unpalatability. Because a higher proportion of males than females stay put at their resting sites, displaying their wings in response to repeated attacks by predators, wing damage was more frequent in males than in females. 5. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test of an adaptive role of aposematic signals presented by unpalatable prey during sudden displays triggered by direct predatory attack. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Defence responses to approaching objects were observed in the mantis Tenodera aridifolia. The mantis showed three kinds of behaviour, fixation, evasion and cryptic reaction. The cryptic reaction consisted of rapid retraction of the forelegs under the prothorax or rapid extending of the forelegs in the forward direction. Obstructing the mantis' sight decreased its response rates, suggesting that the visual stimuli generated by an approaching object elicited the cryptic reaction. The response rate of the cryptic reactions was highest for objects that approached on a direct collision course. Deviation in a horizontal direction from the direct collision course resulted in a reduced response. The response rate of the cryptic reaction increased as the approaching velocity of the object increased, and the rate decreased as the object ceased its approach at a greater distance from the mantis. These results suggest that the function of the observed cryptic reactions is defence against impending collisions. The possible role of the looming-sensitive neuron in the cryptic reaction is also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bats and their insect prey rely on acoustic sensing in predator prey encounters-echolocation in bats, tympanic hearing in moths. Some insects also emit sounds for bat defense. Here, we describe a previously unknown sound-producing organ in Geometrid moths-a prothoracic tymbal in the orange beggar moth (Eubaphe unicolor) that generates bursts of ultrasonic clicks in response to tactile stimulation and playback of a bat echolocation attack sequence. Using scanning electron microscopy and high-speed videography, we demonstrate that E. unicolor and phylogenetically distant tiger moths have evolved serially homologous thoracic tymbal organs with fundamentally similar functional morphology, a striking example of convergent evolution. We compared E. unicolor clicks to that of five sympatric tiger moths and found that 9 of 13 E. unicolor clicking parameters were within the range of sympatric tiger moths. Remaining differences may result from the small size of the E. unicolor tymbal. Four of the five sympatric clicking tiger moth species were unpalatable to bats (0-20 % eaten), whereas E. unicolor was palatable to bats (86 % eaten). Based on these results, we hypothesize that E. unicolor evolved tymbal organs that mimic the sounds produced by toxic tiger moths when attacked by echolocating bats. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - When adult female mantids (Stagmatoptera biocellata) are faced with a bird, a "frightening response" is displayed called a deimatic reaction (DR). Habituation of this mantid's response due to repeated presentation of 3 different species of birds was studied. The response decrement appeared with all 3 stimuli: a decrease in the number of DRs, an increase in the percentage of incomplete responses, and a shortening in the response duration. Significant retention of the effects of habituation was found after 6 days. (24 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1971 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Under certain conditions, sharp tapping to the metasternum and anterior abdominal sternites causes both sexes of the normally procryptic Australian stick insect Eurycnema goliath (Gray) to face the source of disturbance and to display the vivid red undersurfaces of the remigia of the wings, and tegmina and a pair of eye-like spots on the metacoxae. Then the metathoracic legs are rapidly struck togethe once or a number of times, each strike being accompanied by a swishing sound apparently produced by wing movement. A somewhat similar reaction was noted in a female of the stick insect Tropidoderus childrenii (Gray) which has no red. It is suggested that this reaction is defensive, enabling the insect sometimes to bluff predators by undergoing a sudden transformation from a procryptic appearance to a startling pseudoaposematic one. © 1966.

AB  - Adaptive coloration is under conflicting selection pressures: choosing potential mates and warning signaling against visually guided predators. Different elements of the color signal may therefore be tuned by evolution for different functions. We investigated how mimicry in four pairs of Heliconius comimics is potentially seen both from the perspective of butterflies and birds. Visual sensitivities of eight candidate avian predators were predicted through genetic analysis of their opsin genes. Using digital image color analysis, combined with bird and butterfly visual system models, we explored how predators and conspecifics may visualize mimetic patterns. Ultraviolet vision (UVS) birds are able to discriminate between the yellow and white colors of comimics better than violet vision (VS) birds. For Heliconius vision, males and females differ in their ability to discriminate comimics. Female vision and red filtering pigments have a significant effect on the perception of the yellow forewing band and the red ventral forewing pattern. A behavioral experiment showed that UV cues are used in mating behavior; removal of such cues was associated with an increased tendency to approach comimics as compared to conspecifics. We have therefore shown that visual signals can act to both reduce the cost of confusion in courtship and maintain the advantages of mimicry. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The ontogeny of antipredator behaviour of paradise fish was examined using a simple testing method. The results showed that the ability to recognize eyespots appears in larvae between 15 and 20 days old. At the same time, two horizontally placed eyespots produced the most pronounced effect on the behaviour of the larvae. Testing different inbred strains revealed that the ontogeny of antipredator behaviour is also under broad genetic control, as the response to a model predator was strong in one strain but weak in another. The results suggest that the recognition of eyespots coincides with larvae becoming more conspicuous to predators by the appearance of pigmentation and increasing level of swimming activity (exploration). 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Feeding responses of blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) were studied experimentally to determine whether unfamiliar colours would cause hesitation when presented during a feeding act. The blue jays were trained to push flaps aside and pick out discs under these flaps in order to obtain mealworms in a specially designed feeding apparatus. If the interval between the time when a bird pushed a flap aside and took out the underlying disc was significantly longer in experimental trials than the mean established over a control series of trials, the hesitation was considered a startle response. Novel colours (colours that birds had never seen before in this context) caused a startle response, as did rare colours that the birds had experienced before in this context but that they had not been trained on). Experimental latency times were also affected by avoidance training. Birds trained to avoid dark grey discs subsequently took longer to pick up black discs, while birds trained to avoid light grey discs subsequently took longer to pick up both white and black discs. These findings suggest that dark colours would cause more hesitation by predators than would light colours. © 1983.

AB  - Insect defense sounds have been reported for centuries. Yet, aside from the well-studied anti-bat sounds of tiger moths, little is understood about the occurrence, function, and evolution of these sounds. We define a defense sound as an acoustic signal (air- or solid-borne vibration) produced in response to attack or threat of attack by a predator or parasitoid and that promotes survival. Defense sounds have been described in 12 insect orders, across different developmental stages, and between sexes. The mechanisms of defensive sound production include stridulation, percussion, tymbalation, tremulation, and forced air. Signal characteristics vary between species, and we discuss how morphology, the intended receiver, and specific functions of the sounds could explain this variation. Sounds can be directed at predators or non-predators, and proposed functions include startle, aposematism, jamming, and alarm, although experimental evidence for these hypotheses remains scant for many insects. The evolutionary origins of defense sounds in insects have not been rigorously investigated using phylogenetic methodology, but in most cases it is hypothesized that they evolved from incidental sounds associated with non-signaling behaviors such as flight or ventilatory movements. Compared to our understanding of visual defenses in insects, sonic defenses are poorly understood. We recommend that future investigations focus on testing hypotheses explaining the functions and evolution of these survival sounds using predator-prey experiments and comparative phylogenetics. © Copyright © 2021 Low, Naranjo and Yack.

AB  - Anti-predator defences are typically regarded as relatively static signals that conceal prey or advertise their unprofitability. However, startle displays are complex performances that deter or confuse predators and can include a spectacular array of movements, colours and sounds. Yet, we do not fully understand the mechanisms by which they function, their evolutionary correlates, or the conditions under which they are performed and evolve. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses of startle displays including behavioural data, using praying mantises as a model system. We included 58 species that provide a good representation of mantis diversity and estimated the strength of phylogenetic signal in the presence and complexity of displays. We also tested hypotheses on potential evolutionary correlates, including primary defences and body size. We found that startle displays and morphological traits were phylogenetically conserved, whereas behavioural traits were highly labile. Surprisingly, body size was not correlated with display presence or complexity in phylogenetically controlled analyses. Species-rich clades were more likely to exhibit displays, suggesting that startle displays were probably involved in lineage diversification. We suggest that to further elucidate the conditions under which startle displays evolve, future work should include quantitative descriptions of multiple display components, habitat type, and predator communities. Understanding the evolution of startle displays is critical to our overall understanding of the theory behind predator-prey dynamics. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Predation has driven the evolution of diverse adaptations for defence among prey, and one striking example is the deimatic display. While such displays can resemble, or indeed co-occur with, aposematic ‘warning’ signals, theory suggests deimatic displays may function independently of predator learning. The survival value of deimatic displays against wild predators has not been tested before. Here we used the mountain katydid Acripeza reticulata to test the efficacy of a putative deimatic display in the wild. Mountain katydids have a complex defence strategy; they are camouflaged at rest, but reveal a striking red-, blue-, and black-banded abdomen when attacked. We presented live katydids to sympatric (experienced) and allopatric (naive) natural predators, the Australian magpie Cracticus tibicen, and observed bird reactions and katydid behaviors and survival during repeated interactions. The efficacy of the katydids’ defence differed with predator experience. Their survival was greatest when faced with naïve predators, which provided clear evidence of the protective value of the display. In contrast, katydid survival was consistently less likely when facing experienced predators. Our results suggest that sympatric predators have learned to attack and consume mountain katydids despite their complex defense, and that their post-attack display can be an effective deterrent, particularly against naïve predators. These results suggest that deimatism does not require predator learning to afford protection, but that a predator can learn to expect the display and subsequently avoid it or ignore it. That sympatric predators learn to ignore the defense is a possible explanation for the mountain katydid’s counter-intuitive behavior of revealing warning colors only after tactile stimuli from predator attack. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Prey species defend themselves behaviourally and morphologically, and often use varied antipredator strategies against dissimilar predator types (i.e. terrestrial versus aerial). Striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, spray noxious secretions at predators and advertise this danger with deterrent behaviours and black-and-white aposematic coloration. Evidence suggests skunks are effective at deterring terrestrial mammalian predators but are vulnerable to aerial predators; how skunks assess the risk posed by different predator types, however, has not been examined empirically. We recorded the behavioural responses of skunks to audio playbacks of coyotes, Canis latrans, and great horned owls, Bubo virginianus (the primary terrestrial and aerial predators of skunks, respectively), and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, and white noise as controls. Skunks ran away more often from vocalizations of their main predators, great horned owls and coyotes, than from diurnal falcon vocalizations or white noise recordings. Skunks also tended to run away sooner in response to owl vocalizations than falcon or coyote vocalizations. Finally, subjects tended to engage in vigilance more frequently in response to owl vocalizations than in response to coyote vocalizations, which together with other results suggest that skunks may perceive owls as more threatening relative to coyotes. This study elucidates how a well-defended mammal can determine which perceived threat is the riskiest and alter its behaviour when its main defence strategy may not be successful against all predator types. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - The skin in the lumbar region of nine species of Pleurodema and in the monotypic genus Somuncuria (Anura: Leiuperidae) bears macroglands [lumbar gland (LG)]. Lumbar glands of Pleurodema bibroni, P. borellii, P. brachyops, P. bufoninum, P. cinereum, P. cordobae, P. kriegi, and P. thaul, as well as Somuncuria somuncurensis, were examined using histological and histochemical methods. The epidermis and the dermis of LGs are described. Also, skin of LGs presents characteristic features as the interruption of the Eberth-Katschenko layer and the presence of a differentiated type of gland only observed in macrogland and not previously described for Pleurodema or Somuncuria; this is termed lumbar serous gland. These glands are filled with a granular product, which occasionally is immersed in a matrix. Differences in the secretory products of mucous and serous glands are described, as well as inter- and intraspecific variability of gland structure. The mode of toxin expulsion from macroglands and the homology between lumbar and inguinal glands among anuran families are discussed. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The lesser electric ray, Narcine brasiliensis, is a small, demersal ray capable of generating electricity through its main and accessory electric organs. Although closely related to the large piscivorous torpedo rays, it differs in size, habitat, and prey. Based on these differences, we hypothesized that the main electric organs are used for predator defense rather than feeding and that the accessory electric organs, specific to this species, are used for intraspecific communication. We found that the mass of the main and accessory electric organs were both significantly smaller in females than in males. Whereas the main electro-somatic index does not change with growth, the accessory electro-somatic index increases, providing support for the accessory electric organs' use in intraspecific communication. We characterized the discharge properties of the main electric organ throughout ontogeny by simulating a predation attempt on the ray. Rays always responded by generating electric organ discharges (EODs) and by flexing the tail dorsoventrally and laterally. The main EOD amplitude, measured directly at the source, increased logarithmically with disc width to a maximum measured amplitude of 56 V. Minimum amplitude was more variable, but followed a positive power relationship with disc width. Neonates produced trains comprised of significantly more EODs than the adults. Over the course of the first set of discharges, all age classes showed a decrease in fundamental frequency and an increase in train duration. In contrast to these defensive responses, the rays did not generate EODs while foraging or feeding on live prey. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animals tend to respond more strongly to signals that are more colourful and such signals are also common in nature. This is the first study to explore experimentally the possibility that response biases arising in an animal's recognition mechanisms can explain these findings. We trained domestic fowls, Gallus gallus domesticus, to respond by pecking or not pecking to different colours displayed on a touch-sensitive computer screen. The colours changed in response to the birds' choices, which mimicked a simple evolutionary process. Discrimination training generated response biases for the colours more distinct from the nonrewarding colour. As a result the signals evolved towards distinct coloration. The biases developed in directions towards more intense and towards less intense colour, depending on the colour of the nonrewarding stimulus. The result may be applicable to all sorts of visual signals encountered during the same kind of experiences, that is, when one signal should be avoided and another should be approached. © 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Many prey species perform deimatic displays that are thought to scare or startle would-be predators, or elicit other reflexive responses that lead to attacks being delayed or abandoned. The form of these displays differs among species, but often includes prey revealing previously-hidden conspicuous visual components. The evolutionary route(s) to deimatism are poorly understood, but it has recently been suggested that the behavioural component of the displays evolves first followed by a conspicuous visual component. This is known as the "startle-first hypothesis". Here we use an experimental system in which naïve domestic chicks forage for artificial deimatic prey to test the two key predictions of this hypothesis: (1) that movement can deter predators in the absence of conspicuously coloured display components; and, (2) that the combination of movement and conspicuously coloured display components is more effective than movement alone. We show that both these predictions hold, but only when the movement is fast. We thus provide evidence for the feasibility of 'the startle-first hypothesis' of the evolution of deimatism. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: Deimatic displays are a type of anti-predator behaviour that startles the predator. They have received much recent theoretical attention, enabling the empirical study of this phenomenon within a predictive framework. It has long been known that bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua spp.), when approached by predators, open their mouth widely and expose a conspicuously coloured tongue. Here, we test whether such ‘full-tongue’ displays are triggered by an imminent predatory attack in the Northern Bluetongue skink Tiliqua scincoides intermedia and examine whether this display behaviour is consistent with the predictions from deimatic display theory. First, we demonstrate that luminance at the rear of the tongue, which is only exposed during full-tongue displays, is almost twice as high for lizard and bird receivers compared to the tip of the tongue, and that tongue colouration is generally more conspicuous to a bird than a lizard visual system. Second, staged predatory encounters using model predators reveal that lizards primarily exhibit full-tongue displays in the final stages of a predatory attack. Lizards performed full-tongue displays congruent with the predictions associated with deimatic displays, i.e. rapid exposure of conspicuous elements from a previously inconspicuous state concurrently with aggressive defensive behaviour, most frequently during the final stages of a predatory encounter. Surprisingly, we also found that lizards vary the area of the tongue exposed during chemoexploratory tongue-flicks depending on whether a predator is present or absent. Significance statement: Bluetongue skinks have long been known to expose their large blue tongue in response to predatory threats. However, this behaviour has never been investigated empirically. Here, we use Northern Bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) to test whether this behaviour is consistent with predictions associated with deimatic displays. We show that the rear of their tongue is UV-blue and more conspicuous to predators compared to the tip and that this ‘full-tongue display’ is only triggered in the final stages of a predatory attack. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many insects produce sounds when attacked by a predator, yet the functions of these signals are poorly understood. It is debated whether such sounds function as startle, warning or alarm signals, or merely serve to augment other defences. Direct evidence is limited owing to difficulties in disentangling the effects of sounds from other defences that often occur simultaneously in live insects. We conducted an experiment to test whether an insect sound can function as a deimatic (i.e. startle) display. Variations of a whistle of the walnut sphinx caterpillar (Amorpha juglandis) were presented to a predator, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), when birds activated a sensor while feeding on mealworms (Tenebrio molitor). Birds exposed to whistles played back at natural sound levels exhibited significantly higher startle scores (by flying away, flinching, and hopping) and took longer to return to the feeding dish than during control conditions where no sounds were played. Birds habituated to sounds during a one-hour session, but after two days the startling effects were restored. Our results provide empirical evidence that an insect sound alone can function as a deimatic display against an avian predator. We discuss how whistles might be particularly effective ‘acoustic eye spots’ on avian predators. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aposematic prey that possess chemical defenses advertise these to potential predators using conspicuous warning coloration. Aposematism is often associated with group living, which is hypothesized to enhance the protection of these species. Predators exhibit unlearned biases against foods with warning coloration, and the presentation of a novel sound or bitter-tasting toxin augments these biases. Whether these nonvisual signal components also cause naive predators to more strongly avoid aggregated prey, and whether biases against aggregations are restricted to situations where aggregated prey possess visual signals typically associated with aposematism, is unknown. We conducted an experiment in which naive domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) acted as predators and used artificially colored pastry prey. The experiment had a 2×2 design in which naive birds were offered a drop of either water or bitter-tasting chloroquine solution before being given the choice between solitary and aggregated prey that were either both red, a typical aposematic color, or both green (usually associated with crypsis and palatability). We found that birds were warier of red-aggregated prey and attacked significantly more solitary prey before aggregated prey compared with green. After sampling bitter-tasting chloroquine solution, the birds showed a bias in their attack decisions, attacking significantly fewer aggregated prey in total compared with those who had sampled water, but only when prey were red. Thus, exposure to a bitter-tasting toxin affected predatory preferences. We discuss our findings in relation to the mechanisms of bias, the benefits of group living, and the evolution of warning coloration and aggregation. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - The defensive display of a threatened adult striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) involves visual, auditory, and olfactory signals. Detection of a potential predator leads to either avoidance (run, hide, or den) or confrontational (tail-up, stomp, hiss, scratch, charge, aim, and spray) behaviours. Seventy skunks born in captivity were handled at five-day intervals starting at seven days of age and up to 52 days of age. The development of defensive behaviours (tail-up, stomp, run, aim, hide, spray, hiss, scratch, charge, and bite) and physical attributes (eye opening, external auditory meatus opening, and teeth eruption) were recorded. Tail-up, which signifies alertness and enhances warning colouration, was the most common and earliest defence behaviour observed. Musk was present at seven days of age, though the ability of a skunk to forcefully expel its chemical defence is not developed until 17 days. Initially spray events are not aimed at the threat; directed spray is initiated following eye opening at 32 days. Unlike adult striped skunks, juveniles will spray early on in the warning display, and spray behaviour is developed prior to behaviours that require greater mobility (aim, run, hide, scratch, and charge) or direct contact (bite). The proportion of individuals attempting avoidance behaviours, such as run and hide, increased as the skunks matured. However, the tail-up and spray behaviours were more frequent at 32 days of age than at 52 days of age. Inversely, the run and hide behaviour occurred more often at 52 days of age than at 32 days. Chemical defence in striped skunks may be more vital to the survival of juvenile skunks than adults that are capable of displaying the entire range of anti-predator behaviours, have greater experience, and potentially fewer predators. © 2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Università, Firenze, Italia.

AB  - Many butterfly species feature two or four conspicuously coloured eyespots on their wings; the most commonly heard explanation for these markings is that they are used to intimidate predators. However, this explanation has stood, until recently, on the flimsiest of empirical foundations. Now, Adrian Vallin and colleagues have demonstrated empirically the effectiveness of these signals in dissuading avian predators from attacking the bearers. Their work suggests that predators can be intimidated by bold displaying by otherwise defenceless prey, and opens up an interesting challenge to evolutionary ecologists to explain how this apparently maladaptive behaviour is retained in predator populations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous studies that have looked at the aversive properties of simple, predator‐related, eye‐like patterns presented in an artificial context, have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate whether such stimuli had potential for use as bird scarers. The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species. The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area. Each subject was deprived of food for 5 h and then tested in an apparatus which exposed an eye pattern over a food trough immediately after the bird alighted on that trough. 10 measures of the starlings' feeding behaviour were monitored over a 1‐h trial. It was predicted that five of these variables would be positively and five negatively correlated with an increase in the fear evoking properties of the stimulus. The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be an ‘aversiveness index’. The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects. The main findings from the eight experiments are as follows. Simple eye‐like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity. The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused an 88% reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65% reduction in actual feeding time. The presence of ‘pupils’ in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversive than the control card. Once a pattern has the ‘pupil/iris’ distinction then a circular outline becomes important although the shape of the ‘pupil’ appears relatively unimportant. Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the ‘pupil’ and ‘iris’ appears irrelevant. Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed if the same stimuli are presented within the context of a simple head outline. Changing the orientation of a pair of eyes from horizontal to vertical only slightly reduces their aversiveness. The size of the patterns appears to be unimportant within the range tested. The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive. The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl. 1983 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Caterpillars have long been used as models for studying animal defence. Their impressive armour, including flamboyant warning colours, poisonous spines, irritating sprays, and mimicry of plant parts, snakes and bird droppings, has been extensively documented. But research has mainly focused on visual and chemical displays. Here we show that some caterpillars also exhibit sonic displays. During simulated attacks, 45% of 38 genera and 33% of 61 species of silk and hawkmoth caterpillars (Bombycoidea) produced sounds. Sonic caterpillars are found in many distantly-related groups of Bombycoidea, and have evolved four distinct sound types-clicks, chirps, whistles and vocalizations. We propose that different sounds convey different messages, with some designed to warn of a chemical defence and others, to startle predators. This research underscores the importance of exploring acoustic communication in juvenile insects, and provides a model system to explore how different signals have evolved to frighten, warn or even trick predators. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - In many species, rapid defensive reflexes are paramount to escaping acute danger. These reflexes are modulated by the state of the environment. This is exemplified in fear-potentiated startle, a more vigorous startle response during conditioned anticipation of an unrelated threatening event. Extant explanations of this phenomenon build on descriptive models of underlying psychological states, or neural processes. Yet, they fail to predict invigorated startle during reward anticipation and instructed attention, and do not explain why startle reflex modulation evolved. Here, we fill this lacuna by developing a normative cost minimisation model based on Bayesian optimality principles. This model predicts the observed pattern of startle modification by rewards, punishments, instructed attention, and several other states. Moreover, the mathematical formalism furnishes predictions that can be tested experimentally. Comparing the model with existing data suggests a specific neural implementation of the underlying computations which yields close approximations to the optimal solution under most circumstances. This analysis puts startle modification into the framework of Bayesian decision theory and predictive coding, and illustrates the importance of an adaptive perspective to interpret defensive behaviour across species. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Cuttlefish possess the complex ability to identify approaching threats and then to selectively express the appropriate defense. We examined the visual cues used by Sepia officinalis cuttlefish during predator detection and the responses they selected. Using computer-generated stimuli, we set out to quantitate the deimatic responses to artificial looming stimuli of different shapes and contrasts. Defensive behavior gradually intensified as geometrical shapes resembled an image of a fish. Therefore, in addition to an object's size or its sudden increase in size, cuttlefish use form recognition to identify a threat. Cuttlefish demonstrated equal performance in predator detection trough clear water when presented with intensity versus polarization contrasts. However, when the water turbidity increased, the cuttlefish still detected looming fish shapes based on polarization contrast even when intensity information alone did not suffice. These results demonstrate the interplay between intensity and polarization information transmission and processing in the spatial domain. As nectobenthic organisms, cuttlefish probably experience low visibility conditions on a regular basis. The ability to see further into turbid water and to better detect an approaching object would be beneficial for their survival. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Warning displays are defined as signals designed to intimidate predators or indicate a proclivity to fight. However, support for the idea that warning behaviors signal an intent to fight is largely based on anecdotes and isolated observations, and a complete understanding of antipredator behavior will only be achieved if specific hypotheses are experimentally tested. Herein, we tested in a North American viperid snake, the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus (Lacepede, 1789)), the hypothesis that warning displays serve as a reliable signal to potential predators that a snake will strike. The cottonmouth exhibits two stereotypical warning displays during predator confrontation, i.e., mouth gaping and tail vibrations, making it an ideal study organism to experimentally test the relationship between warning displays and defensive striking. To test this idea, we recorded the sequence of defensive behavior - gaping, tail vibrating, and striking - of cottonmouths towards a standardized predatory stimulus in the laboratory. As predicted, snakes that gaped during the trials were subsequently more likely to strike than snakes that did not. In contrast, striking behavior was independent of the occurrence of tail vibrations. Our results suggest that gaping behavior - but not tail-vibrating behavior - may provide an honest signal to would-be predators. © 2007 NRC.

AB  - Electricity, the interaction between electrically charged objects, is widely known to be fundamental to the functioning of living systems. However, this appreciation has largely been restricted to the scale of atoms, molecules, and cells. By contrast, the role of electricity at the ecological scale has historically been largely neglected, characterised by punctuated islands of research infrequently connected to one another. Recently, however, an understanding of the ubiquity of electrical forces within the natural environment has begun to grow, along with a realisation of the multitude of ecological interactions that these forces may influence. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive collation and synthesis of research in this emerging field of electric ecology. This includes assessments of the role electricity plays in the natural ecology of predator–prey interactions, pollination, and animal dispersal, among many others, as well as the impact of anthropogenic activity on these systems. A detailed introduction to the ecology and physiology of electroreception – the biological detection of ecologically relevant electric fields – is also provided. Further to this, we suggest avenues for future research that show particular promise, most notably those investigating the recently discovered sense of aerial electroreception. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Measures of physiological performance capacity, such as bite force, form the functional basis of sexual selection. Information about fighting ability may be conveyed through a structural feature such as a rostrum (i.e. horn) or a colour signal and thereby help reduce costly conflict. We quantified sexual dimorphism in key traits likely to be the targets of sexual selection in Tennent's leaf-nosed lizard (Ceratophora tennentii) from Sri Lanka, and examined their relationship to bite force and body condition. We found body length and bite force to be similar for males and females. However, head length was significantly greater in males and they had significantly more conspicuous throats and labials (chromatic contrast and luminance) than females. Males also had a proportionally larger rostrum, which we predicted could be an important source of information about male quality for both sexes. Rostrum length was correlated with throat chromatic contrast in males but not females. Nonetheless, the rostrum and aspects of coloration did not correlate with bite force or body condition as we predicted. We have no information on contest escalation in this species but if they rarely bite, as suggested by a lack of difference in bite force between males and females, then bite force and any associated signals would not be a target of selection. Finally, males and females had similar spectral reflectance of the mouth and tongue and both had a peak in the ultra-violet, and were conspicuous to birds. Lizards only gaped their mouths during capture and not when threatened by a potential predator (hand waving). We hypothesize that conspicuous mouth colour may act as a deimatic signal, startling a potential predator, although this will need careful experimental testing in the future. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Morphological and behavioural traits can serve as anti-predator defence either by reducing detection or recognition risks, or by thwarting initiated attacks. The latter defence is secondary and often involves a 'startle display' comprising a sudden release of signals targeting more than one sensory modality. A suggested candidate for employing a multimodal defence is the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, which, by wing-flicking suddenly, produces sonic and ultrasonic sounds and displays four large eyespots when attacked. The eyespots make small birds retreat, but whether the sounds produced thwart predator attacks is largely unknown. Peacocks hibernate as adults in dark wintering sites and employ their secondary defence upon encounter with small rodent predators during this period. In this study, we staged predator-prey encounters in complete darkness in the laboratory between wild mice, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus, and peacocks which had their sound production intact or disabled. Results show that mice were more likely to flee from sound-producing butterflies than from butterflies which had their sound production disabled. Our study presents experimental evidence that the peacock butterfly truly employs a multimodal defence with different traits targeting different predator groups; the eyespots target birds and the sound production targets small rodent predators. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Documentation of predator attacks in nature is important for understanding how specific antipredator defences have evolved, but previous accounts have been mostly anecdotal. Therefore, we monitored predation on two closely related butterfly species, Aglais urticae and Inachis io, during winter hibernation. Butterflies were placed singly close to the floor on walls in dark, seminatural hibernation sites (e.g. unheated outhouses). We used motion-initiated infrared-sensitive cameras to record predator attacks on the butterflies. The antipredator attributes of the two species have two characteristics: during rest the butterflies reduce predators' attention by mimicking leaves but they can suddenly change their guise by repeatedly flicking their wings. The wing flicking also produces hissing sounds and ultrasonic clicks and, furthermore, I. io, but not A. urticae, have large eyespots on the dorsal wing surface. The two butterfly species suffer from mouse predation during the winter and mice have been suggested as potential targets for the butterflies' sound production. Results showed that (1) mice (Apodemus spp.) were important predators on butterflies, (2) I. io often survived attacks by wing-flicking behaviour, and (3) both species moved to less accessible positions after interactions with mice and other small mammalian predators, but I. io more often so. The successful predator evasion in darkness by I. io suggests a multimodal defence; in addition to the large eyespots, which intimidate birds, we suggest that the hissing and/or click sounds produced during wing flicking may have evolved as defence against rodent attacks. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Samples of the meadow brown butterfly, Maniola jurtina, were collected from all five of the Canary Islands where it occurs. The butterflies were scored for several spotting characters on both fore‐ and hindwings and assessed for damage from predators. The analysis reveals considerable interisland heterogeneity for spotting characters and suggests that the populations fall into two relatively distinct, homogeneous groups, which inhabit the islands of Gran Canaria and La Gomera, on the one hand, and Tenerife, El Hierro and La Palma, on the other. The main predators are lizards and insectivorous birds. Predator damage is non‐random in the following respects: males are more damaged than females; high spot male phenotypes are more damaged than low ones early in the flight period (April‐May); symmetrical damage, probably acquired while resting, is commoner in females, while asymmetrical damage is more characteristic of males. Damage generally increases in both sexes through the flight period. Comparison of the bulked Canary Island samples with museum material from North Africa and Iberia suggests that the former area is the more likely source of the island populations. However, samples from two islands more resemble Iberian stock and it is suggested that the butterfly may have colonized the islands, either by introduction or immigration, on two occasions.

AB  - Bioluminescence, which occurs in approximately 80% of the world's mesopelagic fauna, can take the form of a low-intensity continuous glow (e.g. for counter-illumination or signalling) or fast repetitions of brighter anti-predatory flashes. The southern elephant seal (SES) is a major consumer of mesopelagic organisms, in particular the abundant myctophid fish, yet the fine-scale relationship between this predator's foraging behaviour and bioluminescent prey remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that brief, intense light emissions should be closely connected with prey strikes when the seal is targeting bioluminescent prey that reacts by emitting anti-predator flashes. To test this, we developed a biologging device containing a fast-sampling light sensor together with location and movement sensors to measure simultaneously anti-predator bioluminescent emissions and the predator's attack motions with a 20 ms resolution. Tags were deployed on female SES breeding at Kerguelen Islands and Peninsula Valdés, Argentina. In situ light levels in combination with duration of prey capture attempts indicated that seals were targeting a variety of prey types. For some individuals, bioluminescent flashes occurred in a large proportion of prey strikes, with the timing of flashes closely connected with the predator's attack motion, suggestive of antipredator emissions. Marked differences across individuals and location indicate that SES do exploit bioluminescent organisms but the proportion of these in the diet varies widely with location. The combination of wideband light and acceleration data provides new insight into where and when different prey types are encountered and how effectively they might be captured. © 2020 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain why dinoflagellate bioluminescence deters copepod grazing: startle response, aposematic warning, and burglar alarm. These hypotheses propose dinoflagellate bioluminescence (A) startles predatory copepods, (B) warns potential predators of toxicity, and (C) draws the attention of higher order visual predators to the copepod's location. While the burglar alarm is the most commonly accepted hypothesis, it requires a high concentration of bioluminescent dinoflagellates to be effective, meaning the bioluminescence selective advantage at lower, more commonly observed, dinoflagellate concentrations may result from another function (e.g. startle response or aposematic warning). Therefore, a series of experiments was conducted to evaluate copepod grazing (Acartia tonsa) on bioluminescent dinoflagellates (during bioluminescent and nonbioluminescent phases, corresponding to night and day, respectively) at different concentrations (10, 1000, and 3000 cells mL−1), on toxic (Pyrodinium bahamense var. bahamense) and nontoxic (Lingulodinium polyedrum) bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and in the presence of nonluminescent diatoms (Thalassiosira eccentrica). Changes in copepod ingestion rates, clearance rates, and feeding preferences as a result of these experimental factors, particularly during the mixed trails with nonluminescent diatoms, indicate there is a concentration threshold at which the burglar alarm becomes effective and below which dinoflagellate bioluminescence functions as an aposematic warning. © 2017 The American Society of Photobiology

AB  - Many insects exhibit secondary defence mechanisms upon contact with a predator, such as defensive sound production or regurgitation of gut contents. In the tettigoniid Poecilimon ornatus, both males and females are capable of sound production and of regurgitation. However, wing stridulatory structures for intraspecific acoustic communication evolved independently in males and females, and may result in different defence sounds. Here we investigate in P. ornatus whether secondary defence behaviours, in particular defence sounds, show sex-specific differences. The male defence sound differs significantly from the male calling song in that it has a longer syllable duration and a higher number of impulses per syllable. In females, the defence sound syllables are also significantly longer than the syllables of their response song to the male calling song. In addition, the acoustic disturbance stridulation differs notably between females and males as both sexes exhibit different temporal patterns of the defence sound. Furthermore, males use defence sounds more often than females. The higher proportion of male disturbance stridulation is consistent with a male-biased predation risk during calling and phonotactic behaviour. The temporal structures of the female and male defence sounds support a deimatic function of the startling sound in both females and males, rather than an adaptation for a particular temporal pattern. Independently of the clear differences in sound defence, no difference in regurgitation of gut content occurs between the sexes. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Escape reactions to simulated sub-lethal prédation were investigated in field and laboratory experiments in four epibenthic brittle stars, Ophiura albida (Forbes), Ophiura ophiura (L.), Ophiothrix fragilis (Abildgaard) and Ophiocomina nigra (Abildgaard) from the Swedish West Coast. Predation attacks were simulated in three ways: by (1) momentarily approaching an individual with the palm of the hand, simulating an attack attempt without contact, (2) pinching an arm with forceps simulating a failed attack, and (3) amputating an arm using scissors and thus simulating a sub-lethal attack causing an injury. All brittle star species responded to predation attempts by escaping in a direction away from the site of attack, and a more rapid response was elicited when an arm was amputated (3) than if the arm was pinched (2). However, O. albida showed little or no reaction at all when attacked. O. ophiura was the only species that responded when momentarily approached by the palm of the hand (1). O. ophiura also showed a possibly intimidating (deimatic) behaviour by twisting up towards the point of attack, followed by a rapid escape response when pinched by forceps. In O. fragilis, observations also indicated that the thrashing of amputated arms may act as an efficient decoy, pre-occupying a predator such as O. nigra and allowing O. fragilis to escape. The escaping behaviour of O. fragilis and O. nigra in the field varied depending on the proximity to a potential shelter such as a holdfast or aggregate of conspecifics. If a specimen was found close to a shelter it only withdrew its arms or took a single step. Crypsis was also the main defensive behaviour in aquarium experiments with O. nigra in the presence of sustained predation by a fish, Labrus bergylta. The diverse reactions to predation encounter events found in this study suggest that the initial response to predation events by active flight may be followed by a cryptic behaviour to reduce the probability of detection and recognition if the predation pressure remains high. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Behavior is often plastic and the study of the functional basis of behavior should provide insights into the adaptive role of the mechanisms responsible for behavioral flexibility. Cognitive biases provide a window into the psychological mechanisms of behavior and a functional theory of behavioral mechanisms should be able to explain also the evolutionary significance of cognitive biases, that is, whether they should be seen as a solution to environmental problems or more as a by-product of adaptive rules. But how should such a theory be developed? In behavioral ecology, the "heuristics" approach has been prevailing. It proposes the rule first and then it investigates how the rule should be optimally modified to solve the problems posed by the environment, cognitive biases being a possible solution. Here, I explore an alternative approach, which derives rules from formal models of optimality. By focusing on mate choice, I present an optimal Bayesian decision-making model, based on the computation of the cumulative sums of the log-likelihood ratios that the quality of a prospective mate is either higher or lower than average. When uncertainty is high, log-likelihood ratios can be approximated to a linear function of mate quality; specifically, they may be expressed as deviations of the perceived quality from the population mean, weighted by the perceived assessment accuracy. I use this model to illustrate the different origins and, possibly, the different functional role of decision-making biases. More generally, I propose the model as an attempt to develop an evolutionary theory of behavioral mechanisms. © The Author 2014.

AB  - A series of laboratory experiments examined the effect of the size of predator models on the behaviour of larval paradise fish Macropodus opercularis L, of different age (15 and 20 days old). In a small runway, individually tested larval paradise fish could approach a model predator of different size, with or without eyespots. The duration of approach, the number of fleeings and backings were measured. Fifteen-day-old larvae showed similar moderate level avoidance to all models but fled more in the presence of larger models. The approach behaviour in 20-day-old larvae depended on the size of the model but only if it had eyespots, and larvae fled and backed more with increasing size of the model. However, manipulation of larval length within age category had no effect on predator avoidance. Since the recognition of the two eyespots seems to be age dependent, it is hypothesized that only larvae older than 20 days will behave in a 'threat-sensitive' manner in the presence of predator models by avoiding larger ones.

AB  - Abstract: Investigating the stimuli that elicit dynamic defensive displays can indicate when throughout the predation sequence prey are likely to perform them. This is crucial to understanding whether these displays function as classic deimatic ‘startle’ displays, facultative aposematism or aid in facilitation of predator learning. We investigated the triggers of defensive display in three different praying mantis species found in eastern Australia; Archimantis latistyla, Hierodula majuscula and Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Dynamic displays in praying mantises have been described as ‘deimatic’ and given the risks inherent in sustaining an attack, especially as mantises are not chemically defended, we predicted that mantises would perform their displays to stimuli that simulate early cues of predation. In a randomised order, we exposed each mantis to five different stimuli simulating a non-specific predator, including tactile and non-tactile stimuli. All species performed their display in response to tactile stimuli however A. latistyla and H. majuscula were more likely to respond than P. albofimbriata. The smallest species, P. albofimbriata, did not readily respond to simulated attacks and was the least likely to perform a display. Our results do not meet the prediction that mantises should respond to stimuli that correspond with early stages of the predation sequence. This raises questions surrounding the utilisation of defensive displays in non-chemically defended prey and contributes to our understanding of predator-prey dynamics during the predation sequence. Significance statement: Startle displays, or deimatic displays, present some of the most charismatic and well-known examples of animal behaviour and colouration. Particularly in animals such as praying mantises, defensive displays are classically cited examples of anti-predator adaptations. It is generally stated that defensive displays in animals function by startling the predator before they have attacked; however, evidence is accumulating that dynamic displays may function in a number of ways including facilitating predator learning, or facultative aposematism. We found that three species of praying mantises only performed dynamic displays in response to simulated predator attacks. This contrasts with predictions that displays should happen before predator attacks, thus fundamentally challenging our understanding of why these strategies have evolved and how they are utilised in nature. This adds to growing evidence that apparent ‘deimatic displays’ may actually function in other ways such as facilitating predator learning, even in non-chemically defended animals such as praying mantises. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Rationale Amphibians can produce a large amount of bioactive peptides over the skin. In order to map the precise tissue localization of these compounds and evaluate their functions, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and gene expression studies were used to investigate a possible correlation between molecules involved in the antimicrobial defense mechanisms and anti-predatory behavior by Physalaemus nattereri. Methods Total skin secretion of P. nattereri was analyzed by classical Protein Chemistry and proteomic techniques. Intact inguinal macroglands were dissected from the rest of the skin and both tissues were analyzed by MSI and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. Peptides were primarily identified by de novo sequencing, automatic Edman degradation and cDNA data. Results Fifteen bradykinin (BK)-related peptides and two antimicrobial peptides were sequenced and mapped by MSI on the inguinal macrogland and the rest of P. nattereri skin. RT-PCR results revealed that BK-related peptide levels of expression were about 30,000 times higher on the inguinal macroglands than on the any other region of the skin, whilst antimicrobial peptide ions appear to be evenly distributed in both investigated regions. Conclusions The presence of antimicrobial peptides in all investigated tissue regions is in accordance with the defensive role against microorganisms thoroughly demonstrated in the literature, whereas BK-related molecules are largely found on the inguinal macroglands suggesting an intriguing link between their noxious activities against potential predators of P. nattereri and the frog's deimatic behavior.

AB  - The hypothesis of satyric mimicry postulates that the colour patterns of an animal may make its identity ambiguous, and this ambiguity interferes with the process of perception in vertebrate predators for a sufficient time to allow the potential prey to take evasive action. It has now been found that eyespots and other designs on the wings of many insect species are often coupled with other wing patterns and designs. These composite images often closely resemble heads and bodies of vertebrates (including birds and reptiles) and of various invertebrates. Such images can be perceived in living insects, although only rarely in set specimens because of displacement of the components. Visual processing by non-mammalian vertebrates generally involves attention to detail, suggesting that, at least initially, and unlike humans, they perceive embedded images on insect wings and bodies and ignore the whole or Gestalt. They are therefore likely to be confused by the ambiguity of the potential prey. It can be calculated that a delay of the order of only tenths of a second in the attack on a stationary insect by a predator could result in failure of capture. It is proposed in the present review that the concept of satyric mimicry be extended to include complex imagery of other organisms. Such iconic images, which often represent toxic or dangerous animals, are particularly common amongst saturniid moths and nymphalid and danaid butterflies (including the Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus). © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Some camouflaged animals hide colour signals and display them only transiently. These hidden colour signals are often conspicuous and are used as a secondary defence to warn or startle predators (deimatic displays) and/or to confuse them (flash displays). The hidden signals used in these displays frequently resemble typical aposematic signals, so it is possible that prey with hidden signals have evolved to employ colour patterns of a form that predators have previously learned to associate with unprofitability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by conducting two experiments that examined the effect of predator avoidance learning on the efficacy of deimatic and flash displays. We found that the survival benefits of both deimatic and flash displays were substantially higher against predators that had previously learned to associate the hidden colours with unprofitability than against naive predators. These findings help explain the phenological patterns we found in 1568 macro-lepidopteran species on three continents: species with hidden signals tend to occur later in the season than species without hidden signals. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Previous work with non-human species has shown that eyespots function as sign stimuli for defensive behaviour. But it is unknown to what extent eyespots are a dominant feature of objects for human perceptual responses. We examined whether young children perceive eyespots as a dominant object feature. One hundred and nineteen children from the first, second, and third grades were presented with small manikins, called "Joopes" that varied in the number, type, and arrangement of facial features. Four kinds of Joope heads were used: single element (eyes, mouth, or beak only), monovalent (spatially concordant eyes and mouth, or eyes and beak), ambivalent (asymmetrical eyes and beak, or eyes and mouth), and cyclopean (single eye with orthogonal beak). Two task groups (Peepers and Gobs) 'helped' the Joopes to either 'see' their food or 'eat' it, by placing food in one of 24 feeding dishes. Results indicated that responses made to the ambivalent Joopes differed, with greater 'drift' shown by the 'eating' group towards the 'seeing' responses than by the 'seeing' group towards the 'eating' responses. The dominant role of eyespots was thus confirmed for children in the second and third grades, but response inconsistencies in the youngest group suggested difficulties in handling incongruent stimuli. The implications of these results for understanding basic perceptual processes are discussed.

AB  - An "eye-spotted" beach ball and a commercially available deterrent eye-spot ball significantly reduced the number of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) visiting a bird table to feed. The commercial ball had a greater deterrent effect than the beach ball at all four distances tested (10, 20, 30, and 40 m). The deterrent effect of both balls decreased with distance from the table, and was neglible at c. 40 m. Deterrence was increased 10% by illuminating the eyes with a rotating halogen light and by reinforcing the visual stimulus with alarm calls of blackbirds (Turdus merula), house sparrows, and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), but declined with continuous use, and disappeared altogether after 9 days. Eye-spot beach balls in a vineyard significantly reduced landings by song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) for 2 weeks, and landings by blackbirds, house sparrows, and starlings for 3 weeks. They failed, however, in the fourth week when the grapes were fully ripe and most in need of protection. Eye-spot balls are environmentally friendly, so could be especially useful bird scarers in organic vineyards and near residential areas. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 1995.

AB  - Visual crypsis of prey is determined by the interaction between an individual’s physical appearance to their predators and visual aspects of their environment. Physical size will impact visual appearance and thus potentially influence crypsis. However, research on this topic is limited, leaving the effect of size in cryptic prey largely unexplored. To identify if the success of cryptic phenotypes is size-dependent, we conducted a series of field experiments in which we exposed two types of cryptic artificial prey (uniform colored and disruptively patterned) of different sizes to free-living avian predators and recorded attack rate. Despite similar statistical power and methodology, we found increasing predation risk with increasing size only for disruptive phenotypes. Our results suggest that large sizes may break down ability for disruptive patterns to effectively break up the body outline. However, further research in more controlled conditions would be needed to distinguish the effects of initial detection and post-detection preferences on attack rates. © 2021, Japan Ethological Society.

AB  - When faced with a predator, some animals engage in a deimatic display to startle the predator momentarily, resulting in a pause or retreat, thereby increasing their chance of escape. Frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) are characterised by a large, pronounced frill that extends from the base of the head to beyond the neck and, when displayed, can be up to six times the width of the head. We used behavioural assays with a model avian predator to demonstrate that their display conforms to deimatic display theory. First, juveniles and adults deployed the frill in encounters with a model predator. Second, the display revealed three colour patches (white and red-orange patches on the frill; yellow mouth palate) that facilitate a transition from a cryptic to a conspicuous state as perceived by a raptor visual system. Third, the display was performed with movements that amplified its effect. The frill area was larger in males than in females, which suggests that the frill might also be co-opted for male-male contests. If future research confirms a role of the frill in male agonistic interactions, frillneck lizards will be a rare case in which a structure has a dual function in a deimatic display and a sexually selected signal. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - Prior work in our lab has shown that an expanding image on a computer screen elicits a hiding response in the Caribbean terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus). We conducted two experiments to identify what properties of the expanding stimulus contribute to its effectiveness as a visual threat. First we found that an expanding geometric star evoked a strong hiding response while a contracting or full-sized stationary star did not. A second experiment revealed that the more quickly the stimulus expanded the shorter the latency to hide. These findings suggest that the anti-predator response to looming stimulus relies heavily on visual cues relating to the manner of approach. The simulated visual threat on a computer screen captures key features of a real looming object that elicits hiding behavior in crabs in the wild. © 2017 Shragai et al.

AB  - Alike the little mouse of the Gruffalo’s tale, many harmless preys use intimidating deceptive signals as anti-predator strategies. For example, several caterpillars display eyespots and face-like colour patterns that are thought to mimic the face of snakes as deterrents to insectivorous birds. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the hypothesis that these defensive strategies exploit adaptive cognitive biases of birds, which make them much more likely to confound caterpillars with snakes than vice versa. By focusing on the information- processing mechanisms of decision-making, the model assumes that, during prey assessment, the bird accumulates noisy evidence supporting either the snake-escape or the caterpillar-attack motor responses, which compete against each other for execution. Competition terminates when the evidence for either one of the responses reaches a critical threshold. This model predicts a strong asymmetry and a strong negative correlation between the prey- and the predator-decision thresholds, which increase with the increasing risk of snake predation and assessment uncertainty. The threshold asymmetry causes an asymmetric distribution of false-negative and false-positive errors in the snake–caterpillar decision plane, which makes birds much more likely to be deceived by the intimidating signals of snake-mimicking caterpillars than by the alluring signals of caterpillar-mimicking snakes. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Animal species have evolved a remarkable diversity of defensive phenotypic strategies aimed to deceive predators and other forms of danger. By relying on deception, these adaptations increase the chances of avoiding physical contact that may otherwise have very high fitness costs. One such deceptive behaviour is the popularly-known neck flattening, or "hooding", observed in some snakes. Hooding consists in the lateral expansion and dorso-ventral flattening of the neck, which creates the impression of a bigger opponent during confrontations. This trait is highly characteristic of cobras (Elapidae family). However, neck flattening is not exclusive to elapids, and has in fact been observed in a few other snake lineages, including some species of the families Lamprophiidae and Colubridae. Here, we present the first report of hooding behaviour in the South American colubrid genus Philodryas, based on field observations conducted on the Chilean species P. chamissonis (the longtailed snake). Our report adds to the few cases in which this deceptive behaviour has been observed in snakes outside the cobra family. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - We describe the final instars of two tropical Sphingidae caterpillars - Eumorpha phorbas and Eumorpha labruscae - from Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica, whose anal horn has become a posterior eyespot structure capable of rapid palpitation. When approached or harassed, the caterpillars palpitate this eyespot and produce the effect of a blinking vertebrate eye. We propose that this "blinking" is an extension of eye mimicry or at least draws attention to the eyespot, functioning to startle or intimidate would-be predators. As snakes lack eyelids and do not blink, this suggests that the blinking eye represents a more generalized (or possibly mammalian) eye. Eyespot "blinking" is probably controlled by the same musculature used to wave the anal horn in earlier instars. The extent to which this eyespot is perceived as a blinking eye, and the degree of protection from the caterpillars' suite of potential predators, remain to be discovered. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The latency of startle reflex potentiation may shed light on the aware and unaware processes underlying associative learning, especially associative fear learning. We review research suggesting that single-cue delay classical conditioning is independent of awareness of the contingency between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). Moreover, we discuss research that argues that conditioning independent of awareness has not been proven. Subsequently, three studies from our lab are presented that have investigated the role of awareness in classical conditioning, by measuring the minimum latency from CS onset to observed changes in reflexive behavior. In sum, research using this method shows that startle is potentiated 30 to 100 ms after CS onset following delay conditioning. Following trace fear conditioning, startle is potentiated 1500 ms after CS presentation. These results indicate that the process underlying delay conditioned responding is independent of awareness, and that trace fear conditioned responding is dependent on awareness. Finally, this method of investigating the role of awareness is discussed and future research possibilities are proposed. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Mediterranean fish of the Trachinidae and Uranoscopidae families are characterized by a poison apparatus on the 1st dorsal fin. These fish hide by burying themselves in the sand using cryptic mimicry Nevertheless, if they are discovered before they have completely buried themselves, or perceive a potential source of danger when already covered, they will raise their 1st dorsal fin which has a bright black spot on the inter-radial membrane. We have shown that this black vexillum acts as a threatening visual cue and that the movements accompanying black mark display can be defined as aggressive mimicry. We therefore thought it interesting to investigate the black mark display in some species of Soleidae, a behaviour never before reported in the literature. In these fish, the black marks are situated on the right pectoral fin which, as a result of the distortion and re-arrangement of some anatomical parts during development, shifts to a dorsal position in adults. Soles also bury themselves in the sand, and they too display their marked fins on the approach of a possible predator, just like fish belonging to the above dangerous families.

AB  - Flash behaviour is widespread in the animal kingdom and describes the exposure of a hidden conspicuous signal as an animal flees from predators. Recent studies have demonstrated that the signal can enhance survivorship by leading pursuing predators into assuming the flasher is also conspicuous at rest. Naturally, this illusion will work best if potential predators are ignorant of the flasher's resting appearance, which could be achieved if the prey flees while the predator is relatively far away. To test this hypothesis, we compared the survival of flashing and non-flashing computer-generated prey with different flight initiation distances (FIDs) using humans as model predators. This experiment found that flash displays confer a survivorship advantage only to those prey with a long FID. A complementary phylogenetic analysis of Australian bird species supports these results: after controlling for body size, species with putative flashing signals had longer FIDs than those without. Species with putative flashing signals also tended to be larger, as demonstrated in other taxa. The anti-predation benefit of flash displays is therefore related to the nature of escape behaviour. Since birds with hidden signals tend to flee at a distance, the flash display here is unlikely to function by startling would-be predators. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The observable diversity of antipredator defences across organisms demonstrates predation's impact on trait evolution. The functions of many traits that are presumed to have an antipredator function have never been directly tested. The spiny orb-weaving spider, Micrathena gracilis, for example, stridulates when grasped. While stridulation was first hypothesized to be an antipredator defence nearly 50 years ago, no data exist to support this hypothesis. To explore the form and function of M. gracilis stridulation, we first quantified the behavioural and acoustical properties of sound production. Next, using laboratory assays, we directly tested the effect of stridulation on survival with an avian predator – blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. Finally, we conducted a large mark–recapture field study in which we compared the natural survival of experimentally manipulated adult female M. gracilis that could not stridulate (silenced) versus could stridulate (control). Stridulatory pulses produced broadband frequency spectra, consistent with acoustic antipredator defences in other taxa. We also observed stridulation by male M. gracilis for the first time. In staged laboratory interactions with captive blue jays, we found no differences in survival between silenced and control M. gracilis. Similarly, in our mark–recapture field study, we found no differences in survival estimates between silenced and control groups, nor an effect of stridulation rate. While M. gracilis stridulation closely resembles antipredator stridulation in other arthropods, our behavioural data do not yet provide solid support for an antipredator function in M. gracilis. © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - Insects have evolved a great diversity of sound-producing mechanisms largely attributable to their hardened exoskeleton, which can be rubbed, vibrated or tapped against different substrates to produce acoustic signals. However, sound production by forced air, while common in vertebrates, is poorly understood in insects. We report on a caterpillar that 'vocalizes' by forcing air into and out of its gut. When disturbed, larvae of the Nessus sphinx hawkmoth (Sphingidae: Amphion floridensis) produce sound trains comprising a stereotyped pattern of long (370 ms) followed by multiple short-duration (23 ms) units. Sounds are emitted from the oral cavity, as confirmed by close-up videos and comparing sound amplitudes at different body regions. Numerical models using measurements of the caterpillar foregut were constructed to test hypotheses explaining sound production. We propose that sound is generated by ring vortices created as air flows through the orifice between two foregut chambers (crop and oesophagus), a mechanism analogous to a whistling kettle. As air flows past the orifice, certain sound frequencies are amplified by a Helmholtz resonator effect of the oesophagus chamber. Long sound units occur during inflation, while short sound units occur during deflation. Several other insects have been reported to produce sounds by forced air, but the aeroacoustic mechanisms of such sounds remain elusive. Our results provide evidence for this mechanism by showing that caterpillars employ mechanisms similar to rocket engines to produce sounds. © 2018 Company of Biologists Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study tested the sensitivity of the tupelo leafminer, Antispila nysaefoliella, to vibrational cues and whether their unique behaviors, first reported by Low (2008), may be elicited by the frequencies matching those of parasitic wasps. In the tick behavior, a larva ticks its abdomen back and forth rhythmically, and in the rattle behavior, the larva rattles its abdomen in short rapid pulses. To test the specificity of these behaviors to vibrational cues, computer-generated signals of pure tone frequencies ranging from 16 kHz were played to the entire leaf of solitary larvae through airborne signal transmission. The experiment demonstrated that the larvae of A. nysaefoliella responded to all frequencies with wriggling movements, but ticked only in response to the frequencies that matched those generated by parasitoid probing activity. Rattling behavior was rarely elicited.

AB  - Metrius contractus, a primitive paussoid bombardier beetle, emits its defensive quinonoid froth with accompanying sound (a faint "hiss"), but the sound is not pulsed, indicating that the secretory emission itself is not pulsed. Pulsed secretory delivery in bombardier beetles appears to occur in Brachinini only.

AB  - The copiphorine tettigoniid Mygalopsis marki uses two acoustic defensive displays which are quite distinct from the tegminal stridulatory mechanism. Both adults and nymphs utilise a stridulation produced within the head capsule. Observation and simple experiment reveal that this sound is produced in conjunction with the passage of air into the buccal cavity. There are large trachea beneath the frons which may be associated as amplifiers of these noises. The hind wings of the adults have small downward projecting spines set in open membranous areas of the wings. When the insect is excited, these spines engage a highly specialised area of the cuticle on the dorsal terga. The production of the noise requires only slight movement of the abdomen. Its role in defense is discussed. 1983 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

AB  - For six years samples of the satyrine butterfly Maniolajurtina L. were collected on small islands in southern Sweden and scored for beak marks, i.e. damage on wings presumably resulting from attacks by birds; in the present study area mainly Red‐backed Shrike Lanius collurio L. An overall mean of 8% (5–1496 in different years) of the females and 1396 (10–2296) of the males had beak marks. Both sexes of M. jurtina show variation in spot‐number on the hindwings and there is some evidence that in some years the frequencies of different spot‐number phenotypes with beak marks differ significantly from randomness. Although it is not known how beak mark frequencies are related to predation pressure (reflecting rates of predation or escapes?) it is suggested that, due to behavioural differences of spot‐number phenotypes, birds act as a selective factor influencing the spot‐number variation. The results are discussed in relation to a recent model proposed by Brakefield attempting to account for variation in spot‐number in M. jurtina. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Marked individual variability has been found in six of the species. Stability of spotting over large areas has not been prominent, but a high degree of apparent geographical variability has been found in four species.Sometimes this has taken the form of clines and sometimes of quantal steps. Some of the quantal changes coincide with the appearance of different “subspecies”. Among the incomplete data presented, parallel geographical variation in different species has not been an obvious feature. There have not been enough samples to test for temporal variation in spotting. © 1975 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

AB  - We introduce a general theoretical description of a combination of defences acting sequentially at different stages in the predatory sequence in order to make predictions about how animal prey should best allocate investment across different defensive stages. We predict that defensive investment will often be concentrated at stages early in the interaction between a predator individual and the prey (especially if investment is concentrated in only one defence, then it will be in the first defence). Key to making this prediction is the assumption that there is a cost to a prey when it has a defence tested by an enemy, for example because this incurs costs of deployment or tested costs as a defence is exposed to the enemies; and the assumption that the investment functions are the same among defences. But if investment functions are different across defences (e.g. the investment efficiency in making resources into defences is higher in later defences than in earlier defences), then the contrary could happen. The framework we propose can be applied to other victim-exploiter systems, such as insect herbivores feeding on plant tissues. This leads us to propose a novel explanation for the observation that herbivory damage is often not well explained by variation in concentrations of toxic plant secondary metabolites. We compare our general theoretical structure with related examples in the literature, and conclude that coevolutionary approaches will be profitable in future work. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interactions between prey and predators are often mediated by signals sent by the prey. Passive signals such as aposematic coloration and active signals such as pursuit deterrence signals are thought to prevent attack from predators. In true fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), the defensive wing display is called supination, and studies have shown that supination effectively reduces the chance of being attacked by salticid predators. In this study, we investigated the proximal causes of supination in staged interactions in an arena. We asked whether the movement of the display target influences the likelihood of triggering supination in the Mexican fruit fly Anastrepha ludens. We tested the effect of motion on fly display in three different ways using (1) a manually moved dead spider or beetle, (2) live bouts with a spider and a katydid and (3) video playback experiments where movement of the display target was controlled. Our results show that flies are more likely to perform supination when the display target moves. The identity of the display target did not influence display propensity, suggesting that the supination of flies is a generalised display behaviour against any possible threat. © 2015, Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan.

AB  - Cephalopods have two main defence strategies: the first consists on reducing the odds of being detected by a predator, while the second focuses on avoiding capture. The aim of this study was to understand the basic behavioural aspects of the octopus Robsonella fontaniana in response to the potential predator Schroederichthys chilensis (catshark) in central Chile. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions in order to determine the effectiveness of camouflage against predators. The results show that crypsis and an increase in the inactivity period are strategies used by octopuses as protection and defence mechanisms against predators.

AB  - Antipredatory displays that incorporate hidden contrasting coloration are found in a variety of different animals. These displays are seen in organisms that have drab coloration at rest, but when disturbed reveal conspicuous coloration. Examples include the bright abdomens of mountain katydids and the colorful underwings of hawk moths. Such hidden displays can function as secondary defenses, enabling evasion of a pursuant predator. To begin to understand why some species have these displays while others do not, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate factors associated with the evolution of hidden contrasting coloration in leaf-footed bugs. First, we investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with body size because these displays are considered to be more effective in larger organisms. We then investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with an alternative antipredatory defense, in this case rapid autotomy. We found that leaf-footed bugs with hidden contrasting coloration tended to autotomize more slowly, but this result was not statistically significant. We also found that the presence of a body size association was dependent upon the form of the hidden color display. Leaf-footed bugs that reveal red/orange coloration were the same size, on average, as species without a hidden color display. However, species that reveal white patches on a black background were significantly larger than species without a hidden color display. These results highlight the diversity of forms that hidden contrasting color signal can take, upon which selection may act differently. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The defensive repertoires of prey are shaped by diverse ecological and evolutionary demands. This can generate trade-offs between the components of defences, as in the classic ‘fight or flight’ dichotomy, or dedicated investment in a singular end, allowing individuals in better condition to mount a more effective defence all round. Further, sexual dimorphism may drive sex differences in such responses, although our understanding of the interaction between sexual selection and defensive behaviour is in its infancy. Deimatic, or ‘startle’, defences typically combine multiple protective strategies, such as camouflage and aposematism, with a rapid transition between them, and thus offer unique opportunities for studying the dynamics of suites of defensive behaviours. Here we examined the display of the sexually dimorphic mountain katydid, with the goal of identifying the factors influencing individuals' escape response and display intensity. In experimental assays designed to simulate encounters with predators, we found that sex and repeated exposure to predation attempts affected components of the defensive behaviour of individuals in diverse ways. Both short-distance (sprint) and longer-distance (endurance) speeds differed between the sexes, primarily via an interaction between the intensity of displays and exposure to repeated predation attempts. Display intensity was best explained by an interaction between experience and sex: males maintained their intensity across 3 days of repeated attacks, while females decreased it. These results reveal complex influences on the expression of antipredator behaviour, and identify potential trade-offs mediating individual responses which differ between the sexes. Our findings also highlight the need to consider sexual dimorphism and the effect of individual condition when studying complex behavioural defences. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - A sample of 2013 meadow brown butterflies, Maniola jurtina, was obtained in the Algarve, southern Portugal, on behalf of E.B. Ford, the founder of ecological genetics. Variation in the meadow brown occupied Ford's attention for more than 40 years. Ford died in 1988; most of his collection had earlier been destroyed, but the meadow browns remained and became available for analysis. The butterflies were scored for spotting characters on both fore‐ and hindwings. The population is homogeneous over the entire area of the Algarve and there is no conclusive evidence of a difference between the two years of collection (1986 and 1987). It is probably also homogeneous with southern Iberia in general, an area unique in the western Palaearctic range of the species as it is characterized by a high spot average in males and a low spot average in females. Algarve butterflies differ markedly from those of the Canary Islands, where there is considerable inter‐island heterogeneity, supporting the view that the Canary Island populations did not originate from southern Iberia. In the Algarve, many females aestivate and by September there is an essentially all‐female population. These are low‐spotted and differ significantly from females active in May and June at the start of the annual (one generation) flight season. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Meadow brown butterflies, Maniola jurtina, were studied on Skokholm Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, from 1976 to 1978 and at six other sites in south Wales from 1973 to 1977. Daily survival of butterflies on Skokholm was estimated by capture‐recapture data to be 0.70–0.84, but these values may be low because in the year of detailed study, 1976, dispersal rates between study sites were high and increased through the emergence period. The butterflies were scored for the number and placing of the hind wing spots (Ford, 1975). Female populations in the east of our study area resembled English populations for they were unimodal at 0 spots. Spotting increased westwards until on Skokholm and the adjacent mainland the females caught were roughly equally likely to have 0, 1 or 2 spots. The Skokholm male populations had many 3‐spotted individuals and so the mode of 2 in the spot‐frequency distribution was less clear cut that in English populations. The trends in south Wales therefore resemble those found along the Cornish peninsula and on the Isles of Scilly. We suggest the increasingly maritime climate and the fragmentation of habitat on the coastal fringes of the species range are factors which may selectively favour butterflies with high flying and dispersal ability. Brakefield (1983) has offered evidence that more highly spotted meadow browns indeed have such an ability. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - 1. An account is given of the course of extinction of the protective displays of two species of Saturniid moth, Rothschildia jacobaeae, and Callosamia promethea, when elicited repeatedly by a tactile stilulus. A relationship between flight responses and oviposition behaviour in the females is also discussed. 2. Both species possess rhythmic displays whose quantification is temperatre-independent, and hence unaffected by metabolic changes resulting from the moths own activity. 3. Experiments were conducted in a standardised flight-chamber. Tactile stimuli were administered with a thin wooden rod, each five seconds after the cessation of the activity elicited by its predecessor. 60 trials were conducted in each experiment, and the experiments were placed at individually different times after the completion of the post-eclosion sequence. 4. The activities released in the experiments were (a) Flight, and its preparatory movement, Shivering; (b) Display. Trials occurred in which neither activity was elicited. Display activity was scored as the number of cycles of the display rhythm performed. Two grades of flight intensity were distinguished, and used to give a flight score for each experiment. The tactile stimuli were ambivalent for the release of display and flight, and the same sets of effectors were used in performing the two responses. 5. Inverse relationships were found to exist between the Flight Score 60 trials, and various measures of display strength. The most important are: (a) An inverse relationship between Flight Score and the highest level of display strength achieved, as measured by the mean of the three highest display strengths in each experiment. (b) An inverse relationship between Flight Score and the total number of Display Cycles performed in the course of 60 trials. The course of individual experiments over the whole 60 trials is consistent with the behaviour shown during the first 20 trials of the series. There is a sharp fall-off of all measures of display strength with increase in Flight Score above zero. In R. jacobacae there is a tendency for the display responses to show rebound after flight bursts. 6. The picture given by an analysis of this type differs from that yielded by the extinetion curves derived from massed data, which fail to reveal the relationship between flight and display behaviour. 7. Explanations of these relationships in metabolic terms, or in terms of muscular fatigue, depletion of reserve substances, etc., are shown to be inadequate. They are, however, consistent with the hypothesis put forward in a previous paper (BASTOCK and BLEST 1958) which proposed the existence of (a) short-term reciprocal inhibitory relationships between the acts of flight and of display, which prevent them from being performed simultaneously, in spite of their mechanical compatibility; (b) long-term relationships whereby a formal 'higher' unit mediating the excitation of flight responses inhibits a 'lower' unit mediating the display response. 8. In unmated females, oviposition follows flight alone, and virgin females will neither fly nor oviposit for several days after emergence unless listurbed.

AB  - A large variety of animals have developed facial likenesses to common vertebrates, presumably serving to deter attack by their predators. Likenesses run the gamut from unbelievable artistic perfection to ridiculous (to us) caricatures. These images of mock predators may either remain as a constantly visible deterrent or be flashed when an attack is pressed home and combined with rhythmic display simulating counterattack, and a hissing sound capable of startling the predator long enough to enhance escape possibilities. The phenomenon of mimicry is strongly linked to that of the in-traspecific display, especially as the perceptual system of the animals involved become increasingly complex. Thus even the displays of such formidable adversaries as the lion, tiger, falcon and cobra may be seen on closer inspection to involve false faces, often supernormal, and presumably have some signalling function as well. Although mimicry, the evolution of resemblances to other species for protection from predators, has been studied for over a century, the mimicry of faces has not yet received the systematic treatment it seems to deserve. It has even been the brunt of ridicule by avowed evolutionists and shunned by mimicry researchers themselves. Logic and reason have been marshalled on an unbelievable scale to discredit what anyone can now see for himself in the photographs. Most of the cases discussed in this paper have been missed, ignored or dismissed by the experts on either side of the fence. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
