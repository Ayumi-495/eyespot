AB  - The hypothesis that fear is involved in the mechanisms of tonic immobility (TI) has been supported by early studies conducted in newborn and adult chickens. The susceptibility to TI changes during development in parallel to other fear responses. TI duration increases following exposure before induction to threatening stimuli such as electric shock, loud sound, stuffed sparrow hawk, as well as in unfamiliar conditions applied before and/or during testing. TI duration and susceptibility are increased by prey/predator eye contact and inversely related with the predator distance. TI duration increases following exposure before induction to threatening stimuli such as electric shock, loud sound, stuffed sparrow hawk, as well as in unfamiliar conditions applied before and/or during testing. The fact that the experimenter presence or the experimenter eye visibility represent a potential source of fear like a natural predator in chicks and in adult hens is controversial. The likely explanations for the contradictory results are discussed in the text. The rearing conditions, for instance, seem to be critical: repeated handling in the first days after hatching reduces the fear of human beings, decreasing TI duration in adulthood with a parallel increase in proximity scores to the experimenter. In chicks, exposure to withdrawal from a positive imprinting stimulus increases and decreases TI duration, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Bilateral symmetry evaluation in lower limb is used for injury prevention, and is an indicator of returning to post-injury activity. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of different angular velocities on asymmetry of the hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratio. Method: Isokinetic concentric hamstring to quadriceps (H:Q) peak torque ratio of the 27 male and female professional basketball players was measured at seven angular velocities (60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 180, 240, 300 deg s−1) on both dominant and non-dominant legs with Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of angular velocity and limb side on our outcomes (p ≤ 0.05). Results: The results showed that with increasing angular velocity, the ratio of hamstrings to quadriceps increases (p = 0.001). There was no difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs in the H:Q peak torque ratio (p = 0.254). In addition, velocity of measurement did not affect the bilateral asymmetry of peak torque ratio of the H:Q of both sides (p = 0.852). Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that measurement velocity does not affect the bilateral asymmetry of the H:Q peak torque ratio of the dominant and non-dominant limbs. In clinical assessments of H:Q bilateral asymmetry, we suggest that physical trainer can assess bilateral asymmetry of H:Q with arbitrary angular velocities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Penguins (Spheniscidae) are a diverse clade of flightless, marine birds. Their eyes, likely a primary driver of behaviour, have been noted to have anatomic adaptations to their amphibious lifestyle. In particular, they have a relatively flat cornea, which would make the transition from a subaerial to a submarine environment require less accommodative effort. However, the ocular dimensions are not known for many penguin species, despite the diversity within the family, and their accommodative abilities have been the source of some dispute. In this study we undertook to establish the basic dimensions of the eye of the smallest, a mid-sized penguin and the second largest penguin. The power of the front surface of the cornea was inversely related to the size of both the eye and penguin, being 41.3 D in the little penguin (Eudyptula minor), a power greater than previously measured in any other penguin species, 26.3 D in the gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and 19.1 D in the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). All other dimensions increased or decreased in line with the size of the eye. All penguins were able to achieve emmetropia in air. The gentoo appeared to be emmetropic underwater. A finding of central corneal thickening in some penguins may be artefactual. Calculations using the ocular dimensions demonstrated that the mean retinal illumination of an extended source of light in the little penguin eye is less than that of its larger, deeper-diving relatives. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - In centrifugal compressors, the shaft seal clearance is critical to equipment efficiency and performance. Applications employing very small seal clearances must rely on abradable materials in the stator (housing) to prevent damage to rotating components in the case of rubs. An interaction (or rub) between the rotating seal geometry and stationary seal material can occur while traversing critical speeds or during upset conditions or transients outside the normal, designed operating range of the compressor such as thermal transients or excessive vibrations. The standard abradable seal material for compressor applications is mica-filled PTFE, but alternative materials are required in applications with elevated temperatures, elevated pressures, or harsh environments where chemical resistance is necessary. The behavior of these various abradable materials during a rub event is not well understood and needs to be further quantified to allow for proper material selection for each compressor design. In order to determine suitable alternative materials, a rub simulation test rig was developed to quantify the material wear characteristics and thermal stability of various seal samples. The test rig was designed with a 7.24-inch (184-mm) diameter rotating section with representative labyrinth seal teeth. The rotating shaft was coupled with a variable speed motor capable of operating up to 24,000 rpm, allowing for surface speeds up to 754 ft/s. A 180-degree abradable seal section was mounted concentric to the rotating shaft, which may be forced into the rotating seal teeth by a linear actuator to simulate the rub. The test rig was designed to accommodate various interaction rates, initially considering 0.1 and 1 mil/s (2.54 and 25.4 μm/s) to simulate a rub caused by thermal growth and a rub caused by vibration or bow, respectively. Furthermore, the test rig was equipped with an ambient heater and pressure enclosure to evaluate seal materials at elevated temperatures and with various gas compositions. This paper presents the design and capabilities of the abradable seal test rig as well as the initial rub test results for Fluorosint 500. Copyright © 2022 by ASME and Southwest Research Institute.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to present the interactive web visualization technique DeepRings. The technique has a radial design, using concentric rings to represent the layers of a deep learning model, where each circular ring encodes the feature maps of that layer. The proposed technique allows to perform analysis of tasks over time regarding a single model or a comparison between two distinct models, thus contributing to a better understanding of the behavior of such models. The design supports several training methods designed to solve Computer Vision tasks, like supervised learning and self-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. Additional charts highlight similarity metrics, and interaction techniques such as filtering help reduce the analysis data. Finally, preliminary evaluations were conducted with domain experts highlighting positive points and aspects that can be improved, suggesting avenues for future work. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this work, we explore the possibility of using drone networks to ensure the internet connectivity to IoT devices located in a larger geographical area with no Internet or other connections. The motivation for our work is a scenario of an early warning of forest fires in remote areas with no or with an intermittent GSM network coverage, where data from sensors are transmitted by drones to areas with network access. The paper proposes a model of such drone network, offering an insight into the possibilities for data routing from drone to drone to the point where Internet access is provided. After reviewing the field and the related research, we present the basic building blocks of the system and their properties: cells, drones, charging stations, network access points, and IoT devices or sensors. As drones are mobile network nodes, the data routing between drones represents the rules for when and to which neighboring drone the data is transmitted at a meeting of two drones. Our two basic routing algorithms are analogous with depth- or breadth-first search in graphs. The first is epidemic routing (flooding) where the data is passed on to all the neighbors, while in first-meeting routing, the data is passed on only to the first-met neighbor. The drone movement is important because it determines which of its neighbors the drone will meet. In our model, we use two types of movement, i.e. random movement and two-phase movement. In the two-phase movement, the drone first explores the entire surface of the cell in concentric circles, and then stays at the edge of the cell to meet the neighboring drones. After that, the drone visits all the IoT devices inside the cell again. The routing and drone movement are implemented with our simulation tool and the results confirm the suitability of the our system model as well as offer insight into both routing algorithms. Although not ideal, they are a viable alternative and, more importantly, they present a baseline for evaluation of future routing algorithms developed dedicatedly for the drone networks. © 2022 Electrotechnical Society of Slovenia.

AB  - Background: Muscular responses to training programs with the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) have been widely investigated to understand its preventive effects on muscle strain injury. Conversely, little is known about muscular responses to the stiff-leg deadlift (SLD), an exercise that preferably activate the biceps femoris long head, precisely the knee flexor muscle most commonly injured. Aims: The aim of the current study was to verify the effect of training programs using the NHE or the SLD on muscle architecture, strength, and functional performance of well-trained rugby players. Methods: Twenty-three male rugby union players completed a 5-week training program using either the NHE (n = 12) or the SLD (n = 11). Biceps femoris long head muscle architecture, hamstring and quadriceps isokinetic peak torques, and countermovement jump performance were assessed before and after the training program. Results: There was no significant group-by-time interaction for any outcome (p > 0.05). NHE group experienced higher percent increases than SLD group for biceps femoris fascicle length (~ 14% vs. ~ 6%; p = 0.015). Within-group analysis indicated that NHE group presented greater effect sizes for muscle architecture outcomes, hamstring eccentric peak torque and hamstring-to-quadriceps functional ratio; conversely, SLD group presented greater effect sizes for hamstring concentric peak torque and countermovement jump height. Conclusions: The NHE should preferably be used to enhance the hamstring eccentric strength and the biceps femoris fascicle length (our primary outcomes, supported by previous studies as risk factors for hamstring strain injury), while the SLD favor improvements in hamstring concentric strength and jump performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Morphological correlations can not only stem from developmental constraints but also from selective pressures. Butterfly eyespots are repeated wing color pattern elements, widespread across species. As developmental serial homologs, they are controlled by similar developmental pathways imposing correlations among eyespots: selection on a single eyespot may induce correlated responses in all eyespots. We study the variations in the ventral eyespots of Morpho telemachus, where two different selective regimes are likely to act: while most eyespots are always-visible, two eyespots are conditionally displayed: hidden at rest, they can be exposed when the butterflies are threatened, or during sexual interactions. We investigate how such contrasted selection across eyespots can alter the covariations imposed by their shared developmental origin. We quantified eyespots covariations within a large population of M. telemachus and compared the observed patterns to those found in M. helenor, where all eyespots are always-visible and thus probably affected by a similar selection regime. We found that M. telemachus conditionally displayed eyespots are less variable than always-visible eyespots and that these two eyespots form a separate variational module in this species, in contrast to M. helenor. Our results suggest that eyespots covariations were shaped by selection, highlighting how natural selection may promote the evolution of modularity. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Zones are the building blocks of urban analysis. Fields ranging from demographics to transport planning routinely use zones — spatially contiguous areal units that break-up continuous space into discrete chunks — as the foundation for diverse analysis techniques. Key methods such as origin-destination analysis and choropleth mapping rely on zones with appropriate sizes, shapes and coverage. However, existing zoning systems are sub-optimal in many urban analysis contexts, for three main reasons: 1) administrative zoning systems are often based on somewhat arbitrary factors; 2) zoning systems that are evidence-based (e.g., based on equal population size) are often highly variable in size and shape, reducing their utility for inter-city comparison; and 3) official zoning systems in many places simply do not exist or are unavailable. We set out to develop a flexible, open and scalable solution to these problems. The result is the zonebuilder project (with R, Rust and Python implementations), which was used to create the ClockBoard zoning system. ClockBoard consists of 12 segments emanating from a central place and divided by concentric rings with radii that increase in line with the triangular number sequence (1, 3, 6 km etc). ‘ClockBoards’ thus create a consistent visual frame of reference for monocentric cities that is reminiscent of clocks and a dartboard. This paper outlines the design and potential uses of the ClockBoard zoning system in the historical context, and discusses future avenues for research into the design and assessment of zoning systems. © by the author(s) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License

AB  - Plasticity in developmental processes gives rise to remarkable environmentally induced phenotypes. Some of the most striking and well-studied examples of developmental plasticity are seen in insects. For example, beetle horn size responds to nutritional state, butterfly eyespots are enlarged in response to temperature and humidity, and environmental cues also give rise to the queen and worker castes of eusocial insects. These phenotypes arise from essentially identical genomes in response to an environmental cue during development. Developmental plasticity is taxonomically widespread, affects individual fitness, and may act as a rapid-response mechanism allowing individuals to adapt to changing environments. Despite the importance and prevalence of developmental plasticity, there remains scant mechanistic understanding of how it works or evolves. In this review, we use key examples to discuss what is known about developmental plasticity in insects and identify fundamental gaps in the current knowledge. We highlight the importance of working towards a fully integrated understanding of developmental plasticity in a diverse range of species. Furthermore, we advocate for the use of comparative studies in an evo-devo framework to address how developmental plasticity works and how it evolves. © 2023 Portland Press Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focused on the effect of acute Judo training on countermovement jump (CMJ) performance and perceived fatigue among a group of highly trained collegiate judo athletes. Twenty male judo athletes participated in this study (age: 20.65 ± 1.22 years, weight: 84.17 ± 28.45 kg). Participants were assessed for CMJperformance changes before, immediately after (0 h), 12 h after, and 24 h after judo training (JT) using unloaded CMJ(CMJunloaded) and loaded CMJ(CMJloaded). All the jumps were performed on a force plate, and the force–time curves were collected for further analysis. Respondents’ perceptions were evaluated using the modified rating of perceived exertion (mRPE) before, after (0 h), 12 h, and 24 h after JT. CMJparameters were analyzed at four measured points using a one-way repeated analysis of variance. Effect sizes (ES) and percentage changes before versus 24 h after JT were calculated for comparison. Associations between the CMJparameters and mRPE were analyzed using the Pearson product–moment correlation. The ratio of flight time to contact time significantly decreased, whereas the eccentric duration, concentric duration, and total duration significantly increased (p < 0.05) in both CMJs 24 h after JT. Compared with CMJunloaded, CMJloaded had a significantly lower (p < 0.05) flight time, jump height, peak velocity, and peak power. The mRPE and CMJloaded peak velocity showed moderate- to high-level negative correlation results both 0 and 24 h after training (r = −0.543, p < 0.05; r = −0.479, p < 0.05). In this study, we only observed the effect of fatigue on the neuromuscular (NM) system 24 h after JT. CMJloaded height may help to better determine fatigue state compared with CMJunloaded. According to the results, the neuromuscular effects of fatigue were not observed until 24 h after a single high-intensity training. Therefore, when arranging high-intensity special training or strength and conditioning training, one should reduce the volume of training appropriately to avoid fatigue accumulation and reduce the risk of sports injuries. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Butterflies are increasingly becoming model insects where basic questions surrounding the diversity of their color patterns are being investigated. Some of these color patterns consist of simple spots and eyespots. To accelerate the pace of research surrounding these discrete and circular pattern elements we trained distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detection and measurement of butterfly spots and eyespots on digital images of butterfly wings. We compared the automatically detected and segmented spot/eyespot areas with those manually annotated. These methods were able to identify and distinguish marginal eyespots from spots, as well as distinguish these patterns from less symmetrical patches of color. In addition, the measurements of an eyespot’s central area and surrounding rings were comparable with the manual measurements. These CNNs offer improvements of eyespot/spot detection and measurements relative to previous methods because it is not necessary to mathematically define the feature of interest. All that is needed is to point out the images that have those features to train the CNN. © 2023 Cunha et al.

AB  - Analyzing asymmetry from biomechanical parameters of the lower extremities has be-come a standard practice for accurate assessment of athletic performance, injury prevention, and rehabilitation. The aims of this study were (1) to determine differences between explosive strength and asymmetry of the lower extremities using kinetic parameters of the CMJ jump test in young female athletics, and (2) to investigate correlation between speed and asymmetry, as speed and kinetic parameters. The two groups of nine female sprinters (mean ± SD; G1-age 15.6 ± 1.34 years, height 170.1 ± 0.57 cm, body mass 62.54 ± 7.73 kg, and BMI 21.6 ± 2.05; G2-age 16.2 ± 1.3 years, height 168.4 ± 0.61 cm, body mass 57.69 ± 3.12 kg, and BMI 20.37 ± 1.38) performed the CMJ test without using an arm swing, as well as a 100 m test. Two tensiometric platforms were used for the kinetic parameters and asymmetry. Asymmetry was calculated by an AI equation, and the values of the takeoff velocities and jump height parameters were obtained by integral formula and the trape-zoidal rule of impulse-momentum methods. The results show differences in four kinetic parameters: height (G1-26.82 ± 3.56 cm, vs. G2-17.45 ± 2.01 cm), concentric impulse, (G1-96.05 ± 16.95 N·s, vs. G2-68.41 ± 4.77 N·s), takeoff velocity, (G1-2.29 ± 0.14 m/s, vs. 1.83 ± 0.12 m/s), and concentric velocity, m/s (G1-1.5 ± 0.175 m/s, vs. 1.17 ± 0.122 m/s), as well as a negative strong and very strong correlation between asymmetry and kinetic parameters for three parameters: Peak Force (G1-r = −0.878, and all subjects r = −0.633), Eccentric Impulse of left leg (G1-r = −0.865) and Concentric Impulse of right leg (G2-r = −0.878), (p <.05). The younger sprinters did not show the principle of muscle activation in the form of a longer preparatory phase of contact time, eccentric and concentric phase, as well as a force impulse that is optimal. There was no correlation between asymmetry and sprint performance. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of different ankle strengthening training programs: eccentric, concentric, and resistance bands, on performance of university level sedentary males. METHODS: Sixty-three males between the ages of 18 and 26 years were randomized to either eccentric isokinetic (N.=21), concentric isokinetic (N.=21), and resistance bands ankle strengthening groups (N.=21). Training was performed three days a week, for eight weeks for both sides of ankle. Each program was made progressively harder by increasing the number of repetitions or sets. Measurements evaluating strength, balance and jumping performance were repeated pre, post and at one month (follow-up) after training. RESULTS: Statistical significance was observed for concentric evertor strength for both sides of the ankle for all groups after training (P<0.05). In addition, statistically significant increases were seen in jumping performance for all groups and dynamic balance for eccentric and concentric groups (P<0.05), with the concentric being statistically higher compared to the resistance bands group for all parameters (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ankle isokinetic strength (eccentric, concentric) training is more effective than resistance bands regarding improvement on strength, explosive strength, and dynamic balance. Ankle isokinetic strength training, which includes evertor and invertor muscles, improves performance, especially when applied concentrically. Therefore, the proper strengthening of ankle muscles will prevent the re-injury of ankles with individuals returning to activities.  © 2021 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - In this work, we present Concentric Tube Robot Design and Path Plan (CTR DaPP), a Python application that utilizes the recently introduced Piecewise Variable Strain approach for the design and path planning of concentric tube robots (CTRs). The application provides a modular platform for implementing and testing combinations of path planners and design optimization algorithms. We apply the Randomly Exploring Rapid Tree and Nelder-Mead algorithms to test the 'follow-the-leader' behavior and demonstrate the potential benefits of variable strain tubes in path planning problems. This platform, paired with the variable-strain model, opens up new research avenues to investigate follow-the-leader behavior, elastic stability, and tube design of variable-strain CTRs through simulation. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background The single leg bridge test (SLBT) has been introduced in the sports context as a way of estimating hamstring muscle capacity for prevention and rehabilitation of hamstring strain injuries. Purpose The primary aim was to examine the association between SLBT scores with concentric and eccentric knee flexor peak torques. Secondarily, this study aimed examine the association of between-limb asymmetries provided by SLBT and isokinetic tests. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred male soccer players (20±3 years) performed the SLBT and the knee flexion-extension isokinetic dynamometry evaluation (60°/s) billaterally during a single visit. SLBT score (i.e., number of repetitions until failure) and concentric and eccentric knee flexor peak torques (normalized per body mass) were considered for analysis. For both SLBT and isokinetic dynamometry, between-limb asymmetry was calculated as the percentage difference between the left limb and the right limb. Associations were assessed through Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results The mean SLBT score was 33.6±9.6 repetitions, concentric peak torque was 2.00±0.22 Nm/ kg, and eccentric peak torque was 2.79±0.44 Nm/kg. Between-limb asymmetry was 0.4±9.6%, 1.08±8.5%, and 1.64±14.61% in SLBT, concentric, and eccentric tests, respectively. There was a poor association of SLBT score with concentric (p<0.001, r=0.275) and eccentric (p=0.002, r=0.215) peak torques. The SLBT between-limb asymmetry was poorly associated with asymmetry found in concentric peak torque asymmetry (p=0.033, r=0.213) and was not associated with eccentric peak torque asymmetry (p=0.539, r=0.062). Conclusion The SLBT should not be used as a clinical tool to assess the maximum strength of hamstring muscles. © 2022, North American Sports Medicine Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is of great importance to be able to evaluate different structural systems not only based on their seismic performance but also considering their lifetime service costs. Many structural systems exist that can meet the engineering requirements for different performance levels; therefore, these systems shall be selected based on their economic costs over time. In this paper, two structural systems, including special steel moment-resisting and the ordinary concentric braced frames, are considered, which are designed to meet the three performance levels: Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS), Collapse Prevention (CP). The seismic behavior of these two systems is studied under three strong ground motions (i.e., Tabas, Bam, Kajour earthquake records) using the Perform3D package, and the incurred damages to the studied systems are examined at two hazard levels. Economic analyses were performed to determine the most economical structural system to meet the specified performance level requirements, considering the initial cost and costs associated with damages of an earthquake that occurred during their lifetime. In essence, the economic lifetime study results show that the special moment-resisting frames at IO and LS performance levels are at least 20% more economical than braced frames. The result of the study for these building systems with different heights designed for different performance levels also shows it is more economical from the perspective of long-term ownership of the property to design for higher performance levels even though the initial construction cost is higher. © 2022.

AB  - The Corbyn’s Cove area in south Andaman Island exposes a ~ 30 m thick sequence of sheet lavas, pillows and hyaloclastite deposits related to the Andaman Ophiolite, India. The upper sheet lavas are emplaced as tabular forms with thick, jointed core, vesicular crust and patchy hyaloclastite. The sheet lavas are criss-crossed by a network of calcite veins. The pillows constitute a modest flow field at the base of the sheet lavas and contain small (4.55 x 5.18 cm) to large (60.89 x 113.86 cm), spherical, non-vesicular, glassy entities. Pillow interiors contain radial and concentric joints. Absence of vesicles suggests that the pillows have been emplaced subaquaeously at depths greater than 4 km. The pillow lavas are fed by dykes. Thick hyaloclastite deposits containing sporadic patches of pillow breccias are intricately associated with the pillows in mound-like progradational bird foot deltas. In thin sections, the pillow lavas are characterized by lanceolate plagioclase and fretted pyroxene quenched morphologies in a holohyaline texture indicating high degrees of undercooling (ΔT ~ 100 to 200oC). Plagioclase compositions range from Anorthite (An97-99) in the core to Albite (An1-9) in the glassy margin. Individual plagioclase phenocryst in the dyke and pillow interior show tabular forms (ΔT ~ 50oC), with effects of albitization of the margin (An1-10; S-D index-1.89 to 65.57) and variable alteration in the core (PI-20.84 to 37.14; CIA-70.92 to 99.34). Geochemically, the dyke-pillow lavas are hypersthene-normative tholeiites that have undergone variable degrees of spilitization and alteration. The sheet lavas have higher concentrations of Cs, Rb, Ce, U, K, Sr, P, Zr and Yb relative to N-MORB due to post emplacement cryptic metasomatism related to the calcite stockwork. These episodes of alteration have influenced the mineralogy and geochemistry of the original lavas. The geochemistry of the lavas indicates that they were deposited in a MORB-like environment, with a possible back-arc affinity. We envisage that the entire sequence from Corbyn’s Cove was emplaced subaqueously during the Late Cretaceous in the Indo-Sino Burmese sea along the flanks of a rising mid oceanic ridge where the magma (1222 to 1230°C; 6 to 8 kbar) was generated at shallow depths (~ 20 km) and erupted to the surface as dykes that fed the pillow lava flow fields. Spilitization of the pillow lavas to various degrees occurred at temperatures between 1218 to 1164ºC and even lower while the hydothermal alteration took place at temperatures well below 300℃. © 2022, Edizioni ETS.

AB  - Particle swarm optimization approach is a swarm based procedure, used to search global optimum solution in a search domain. The Basic PSO algorithm show premature convergence to find global optimum solution (best fitness value of particle). The fitness function value may be maximum or minimum value depends on application. Relative search behaviour of PSO particles are to be guided according to the fitness value of gbest particle. This paper proposed an approach which increases global exploration and local exploitation ability of basic PSO algorithm using angular relation between solutions. The proposed approach named as Balance Search Particle Swarm optimization (BS-PSO) model search space as a concentric circular search environment. The BS-PSO algorithm maintains optimum search behavior, from inception of the search procedure to wider search space. Initially BS-PSO approach provide a controlled and directed procedure to find optimal solution using search exploitation and later on it increase exploration ability of the search procedure to capture global optimum solution. In this manner BS-PSO approach maintain a perfect diversity among solution and prevent PSO algorithm to trap in local optima and premature convergence situation. . © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Isokinetic strength has been useful to assess muscle function related to sports and prevent injuries. The present study measured the isokinetic isometric and concentric shoulder rotators strength, agonist/antagonist ratio, and examined the relationships between isometric and concentric peak torque, and agonist/antagonist ratio in powerlifters compared to a control group. METHODS: The participants were divided into two groups: Powerlifters group (N.=14) and physically active group (N.=9). Participants' were evaluated on isokinetic dynamometer for isometric, and concentric (two velocities, 60°/s and 180°/s) strength of shoulder external (ER) internal rotation (IR). Isometric contractions lasted 10 seconds, and concentric modes were 5 repetitions. RESULTS: Bilateral significant differences, between dominant and non-dominant side, were found in ER peak torque at isometric mode in powerlifters group (P=0.021). Powerlifters showed higher IRpeak torque at isometric mode in dominant (P=0.040) and non-dominant side (P=0.014) than physically active group. Pearson correlations between isometric peak torque and concentric velocities ranged between 0.49 and 0.89 for powerlifters group, and between 0.73 and 0.93 for physically active group. For agonist/antagonist ratio, pearson correlation ranged between 0.47 and 0.83 for powerlifters group, and between 0.48 and 0.86 for physically active group. CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral differences in ERmovement at isometric mode in powerlifters suggest that exercises for shoulder rotators must be included on training for joint safety and balance between sides despite isometric shoulder rotators strength in powerlifters was higher than physically active individuals. Results presented positive correlation between both muscle actions, isometric and concentric, in peak torque and agonist/antagonist ratio. © 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eccentric hamstring exercises reportedly prevent hamstring strain injury in the biceps femoris long head (BFlh). However, information on the favorable adaptive responses in the BFlh to eccentric hamstring exercises is limited. We aimed to examine the acute effect of maximal isokinetic eccentric knee flexion on passive BFlh stiffness as a potential risk factor for the hamstring strain injury using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Ten young participants randomly performed both tasks involving five consecutive repetitions of isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee flexion with maximal effort on different legs. Passive BFlh shear modulus was taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 s after each task. Passive BFlh shear modulus was significantly reduced at all time points after eccentric knee flexion, whereas there was no significant change in passive BFlh shear modulus after the concentric task. The present findings indicate that passive BFlh stiffness would reduce specifically after low-volume, slow-velocity eccentric knee flexion exercise. The findings may help provide practitioners with a basis to develop more effective exercise programs for preventing HSI. © 2022, Journal of Sport Science and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fault diagnosis technique plays an important role in ensuring safety operations and preventing catastrophe for the rotating machinery. In the fault diagnosis framework, the entropy-based method becomes a promising tool for feature extraction. Among the entropy-based methods, the diversity entropy (DE) has arisen increasing attention due to its merits of high consistency, strong robustness, and high calculation efficiency. However, DE confronts the challenge of identifying fault types with different structures, which limits the broader application of DE in the practical engineering. Generally, when faults occur on different structures, the fault features distribute widely over the full frequency band and the main difference is the sideband around the characteristic frequency. Unfortunately, the Haar wavelet used in DE can hardly match all the oscillation pattern caused by different structures, resulting in deficient feature extraction. Hence, this paper presents a high flexible feature extraction method called concentric diversity entropy (CDE), which utilizes multiple wavelets to extract fault features over the full frequency band. Based on CDE, a diagnosis framework has been developed. At last, the simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms five entropy-based methods in identifying fault types with different structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Backside-water-assisted laser drilling (BWALD) is a viable and effective alternative of laser direct drilling (LDD) to fabricate micro-holes. However, it still has its own limitations, primarily due to the generated air bubbles and debris during the drilling process and the involvement of various processing parameters, especially when fabricating micro-holes with high aspect ratios on the non-transparent materials. In this study, a two-step processing strategy based on the sequence of punching through and modification was developed to fabricate the micro-holes on 304 stainless steel. Based on this strategy, two modification methods, namely single circle modification (SCM) and concentric circle modification (CCM), were proposed to amplify the advantages of BWALD during the modification process. Experiments testified that the two-step processing strategy was capable of reducing the taper and improving the roundness during BWALD process. Furthermore, a new strategy of using flowing water (backside-flowing-water-assisted laser drilling, BFWALD) was proposed to solve the problem that the generated air bubbles and debris prevent the water from penetrating the through-hole. It was found that the BFWALD could effectively improve the stability during the modification process and achieved the fabrication of micro-holes with an aspect ratio of 10:1 and a taper of only 0.38° successfully. © 2022

AB  - Fusarium crown rot and wheat sharp eyespot are major soil-borne diseases of wheat, causing serious losses to wheat yield in China. We applied high-throughput sequencing combined with qPCR to determine the effect of winter wheat seed dressing, with either Trichoderma atroviride HB20111 spore suspension or a chemical fungicide consisting of 6% tebuconazole, on the fungal community composition and absolute content of pathogens Fusarium pseudograminearum and Rhizoctonia cerealis in the rhizosphere at 180 days after planting. The results showed that the Trichoderma and chemical fungicide significantly reduced the amount of F. pseudograminearum in the rhizosphere soil (p < 0.05), and also changed the composition and structure of the fungal community. In addition, field disease investigation and yield measurement showed that T. atroviride HB20111 treatment reduced the whiteheads with an average control effect of 60.1%, 14.9% higher than the chemical treatment; T. atroviride HB20111 increased yield by 7.7%, which was slightly more than the chemical treatment. Therefore, T. atroviride HB20111 was found to have the potential to replace chemical fungicides to control an extended range of soil-borne diseases of wheat and to improve wheat yield. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Soil-borne fungal diseases are always a threat to wheat production. Developing molecular markers is helpful in early diagnosis and precautionary treatment of these diseases. In this study, a total of 42 Rhizoctonia isolates and 11 Fusarium isolates were obtained from 84 samples of diseased wheat plants collected from 11 locations in China. Rhizoctonia cerealis (Rc) and Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fpg) were the most abundant species in the majority of the sampling regions, accounting for 77.4% and 11.3% of the total isolates, respectively. Eight internal transcribed spacer (ITS) types of Rc were defined based on ITS sequencing identification, among which the ITS type I was the most predominant types isolated in all test regions. Based on the ITS sequences of all isolates, two specific markers were developed to distinguish Rc, Rhizoctonia solani (Rs) and three species of Fusarium at the DNA level. These markers were used to successfully detect 53 isolates of Rc, Rs and Fusarium collected in the study. Identification results by markers developed in this work were further confirmed by ITS sequencing. These markers could be used to detect the specific infective pathogen in diseased wheat seedlings or soil residues in fields, which would then be useful for early prevention and treatment of diseases sharp eyespot (SE) and Fusarium crown rot (FCR). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Initial contact with alcohol generally occurs during adolescence, and high consumption during this period is associated with increased risk for later alcohol (AUDs) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). Rodents selectively bred for high or low alcohol consumption are used to identify behavioral characteristics associated with a propensity for high or low voluntary alcohol intake. The multivariate concentric square field™ (MCSF) is a behavioral test developed to study rodents in a semi-naturalistic setting. Testing in the MCSF creates a comprehensive behavioral profile in a single trial. The current aim was to examine the behavioral profiles of adolescent, bidirectionally selectively bred male and female high alcohol-consuming (P and HAD1/2) and low alcohol-consuming (NP and LAD1/2) rat lines, and outbred Wistar rats. Alcohol-naïve rats were tested once in the MCSF at an age between postnatal days 30 and 35. No common behavioral profile was found for either high or low alcohol-consuming rat lines, and the effect of sex was small. The P/NP and HAD2/LAD2 lines showed within pair-dependent differences, while the HAD1/LAD1 lines were highly similar. The P rats displayed high activity and risk-associated behaviors, whereas HAD2 rats displayed low activity, high shelter-seeking behavior, and open area avoidance. The results from P rats parallel clinical findings that denser family history and risk-taking behavior are strong predictors of future AUDs, often with early onset. Contrarily, the HAD2 behavioral profile was similar to individuals experiencing negative emotionality, which also is associated with a vulnerability to develop, often with a later onset, AUDs and/or SUDs.

AB  - Besides the optimisation of process parameters such as laser power or scan speed, the choice of the scan path represents a possibility to optimise the laser powder bed fusion process even further. The usual hatching strategy creates a homogeneous microstructure but makes it necessary to switch the laser off and on after each scan vector, which can slow down the fabrication. Moreover, the end of each scan vector is a location susceptible to the creation of keyhole pores. In this work, these disadvantages were meant to be avoided by using scan strategies that consist of longer paths and thus less end of track points. To this end, an open-source tool to tailor the LPBF G-code to geometric part features and advanced path configurations was developed and embedded into a co-visualization platform. With this tool, specimens built with four different types of paths were fabricated and the effect of these alternative scan strategies on pore distributions and path neighbourhood was investigated using micro-computed tomography. In the examined example geometry, a spiral scan pattern reduced the distance the laser had to jump between scanning by 78%. However, with the alternative path patterns, the defect architecture was strongly dependant on the part geometry and increased the overall porosity to 0.42%. Respective alleviation approaches are therefore necessary and are discussed in the remainder of this work. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Introduction: Isokinetic testing is commonly used to analyze muscle strength for prevention and physical preparation. There are few studies about normative strength value for lower extremity in male rugby players. There is no data for female rugby players. The aim of the study was to establish and compare the profile of quadriceps and hamstring strength for female sevens and rugby union internationals by isokinetic strength assessment. Materials: Forty professional female rugby players from the French national sevens and rugby union rugby squads were tested. We used an isokinetic Con-Trex® dynamometer. Data was obtained successively in concentric contraction mode at 60°/s and 240°/s for quadriceps and hamstrings, then in eccentric mode at 30°/s only for hamstrings. Mixed ratio (hamstrings eccentric at 30°/s/quadriceps concentric at 240°/s) was also evaluated. Results: We found no difference for both groups for the mean peak torque. When we normalized to the body weight, Sevens players demonstrated higher quadriceps muscle strength in concentric mode at 60°/s compared to Union players (P < 0.01). Sevens player's quadriceps muscle strength was also higher in concentric mode at 240°/s compared to Union players (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Muscle strength profiles of players from French rugby Sevens and Union teams differ because of game features. These results make it possible to define the muscular qualities required to evolve at the highest female level in rugby union and rugby sevens. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The probe card is a key component to realizing the interconnection between the wafer and ATE (Automatic Test Equipment) in process of wafer test. The characteristics of a high-end SOC chip, such as multi-pin, fine pin pitch, and high performance, put forward higher requirements on the stability and performance of the probe card, such as board thickness tolerance, warping tolerance, graph alignment, interlayer alignment, aspect ratio, impedance accuracy, and even appearance quality, which are several times higher than the ordinary probe card requirements. At the same time, the flatness of probe needles is also a key point to ensure the interconnection of the wafer and ATE. This paper describes the advanced manufacturing process and technologies of this type of probe card, focusing on the research and breakthrough in the key technologies such as high-precision layer-to-layer alignment and high aspect ratio manufacturing technologies, and flatness control technologies. To reach high-precision layer-to-layer alignment, firstly, the stability of material size was controlled from the source by establishing the material expansion and contraction database. Secondly, laser imaging technology was used to improve the size accuracy of the pattern. Thirdly, by optimizing the precision of the positioning hole to achieve higher precision of lamination and innovative proposed a "concentric circle"coupon verification method to ensure the quality of the product. based on these technologies, the layer-to-layer alignment accuracy can reach below 0.025mm. In the aspect of high ratio manufacturing technologies. The technology of both side drilling and Z direction interconnection is proposed. At the same time, through many tests, it is confirmed that both side drilling has a good effect in the range of 20:1 to 35:1 aspect ratio. And Z direction interconnection technology is a good solution to the aspect ratio is higher than the 35:1 processing problem. About flatness control technologies. On the one hand, the flatness of assembly was strictly controlled below 20μm. On the other hand, optical grinding technology is used to grind the needle. This grinding technology is used to grind the needle without external force, to avoid the damage to the needle. Through the research and application of the advanced technology mentioned above, all the parameters of the probe card sample in actual production meet the requirements of the high-end SOC wafer test application, which provides a feasible solution and idea for such products.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Aim: Although protected areas (PAs) are assumed to reduce natural threats within boundaries, their spillover effects remain equivocal. It is necessary to determine whether PAs truly achieve conservation targets and whether they promote or inhibit natural habitat degradation in adjacent areas by blockage or leakage spillover. This study aims to choose 54 nature reserves (NRs) focusing on forest protection as a case study to assess PA conservation effectiveness and spillover prevalence. Location: PAs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Methods: We used matching methods to compare deforestation rates inside PAs and their 20 km buffer zones with matched control areas based on the Global Forest Change dataset from 2001 to 2019. We contrasted the effects of NRs with different management levels, ages and areas. We designed five concentric buffer zones to assess spillover change with distance and estimated potential drivers of the spillover effect to explain its directions and magnitudes. Results: 75.9% of the NRs were effective in preventing deforestation within their boundaries. NRs with different properties showed similar performance on forest conservation. Spillover effects were heterogeneous around NRs. One hundred and twenty-two buffer zones had positive spillover ranging from 0.1% to 5.3%. One hundred and nineteen buffer zones had leakages from −8.84% to −0.1%. Blockages slightly outnumbered leakages at different distances, while leakages happened more frequently when we treated buffer zones as a whole spillover area. The linear model indicated NR age and population density of buffer zones were the most relevant predictors to spillover value. Main conclusions: Most PAs performed well in forest conservation. Leakages could undermine or offset PA conservation efforts and were related to multiple natural or socio-economic factors. We recommend considering the plurality of PAs as well as spillover effect and incorporating a social-ecological framework in further PA establishment and management. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine strength asymmetries in elite athletes of different sports and (2) to examine the magnitude of asymmetries between elite and u18 athletes. Materials and Methods: A total of 254 athletes participated in this study. For the first purpose of the study, the group consisted of adult professional male basketball players (n = 30), elite male (n = 30) and female soccer players (n = 20), male futsal players (n = 30), elite male goalkeepers (n = 22), and professional female volleyball players (n = 20). For the second purpose, male youth goalkeepers (n = 22), youth female (n = 20) and male soccer players (n = 30), and youth male basketball players (n = 30) were compared to the adult athletes of the same sport. Asymmetries were measured utilizing a Humac Norm and Rehabilitation device. Testing included three maximal concentric flexion and extension repetitions at an angular speed of 60°/s. The differences in asymmetries were assessed using ANOVA followed by an LS means post-hoc analysis. An independent samples t-test was used to identify the differences between adult and youth players. Results: It was indicated that none of the groups demonstrated asymmetries greater than 10%, other than the elite female soccer players and female volleyball players. Significant differences were demonstrated between youth and adult soccer players (males and females), with the adult groups demonstrating increased asymmetries. Conclusions: Special consideration should be given to female soccer players and volleyball players, as soccer and volleyball practice and competition at the professional level may induce greater lower -limb asymmetries. The isokinetic parameters can be useful for planning strength and conditioning interventions in order to reduce or prevent those imbalances. Additional unilateral and bilateral jumping testing is encouraged for the verification of imbalances. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective As s toxic hydrocarbon pollutant, oil spills can become oil slicks on the sea surface, which hinders the material exchange between water and air and poses a serious threat to marine ecological environments as well as the production and life of human beings. Investigation on how to realize early warning and continuous monitoring of pollutants in the early stage of oil spill accidents is of great significance to the protection of marine environments. The marine optical remote sensor is a powerful tool to realize continuous dynamic monitoring of large-area marine environments at different scales and levels. But the solar flare which is the main reason for the saturation and distortion of optical remote sensors brings inherent difficulties in improving information extraction of remote sensing. Some previous studies indicate that the solar flare possesses significant polarization characteristics under specific conditions, and polarization detection is an effective method for oil spill detection. However, under the influence of wind speed and direction, the real sea surface cannot be regarded as a smooth one, and the characteristics and states of oil spills are complex. In the 1950s, Charles Cox and Walter Munk put forward a famous Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model of rough sea surface after a long-term rigorous investigation, which conforms very well to the real state of the sea surface. In this paper, the Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model is employed to model the solar flare reflected by rough sea surface affected by wind speed and direction. With the polarization reflection parameter defined by Fresnel's law, this paper quantitatively simulates and studies the spatial distribution and related differences between the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) of solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks with different refractive indexes under different incident and observation geometries, as well as different wind speed and direction on the sea surface. This paper hopes that the simulation results can facilitate the application of multi-angle polarization remote sensing technology for marine oil spill surveillance. Methods Firstly, with the polarization reflectance coefficients defined by Fresnel's law, the orthogonal polarization Fresnel reflectance Rp and Rs of the solar flare reflected by calm sea surface are obtained. According to Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model, the polarization bidirectional reflectance Rglint-p and Rglint-s of the solar flare reflected by rough sea surface are calculated based on Rp and Rs. In the next step, on the basis of Rglint-p and Rglint-s, the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by different sea surface media with various refractive indexes on rough sea surface affected by different wind speed and direction is simulated with respect to any incident and observation geometry. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of DOLP differences between clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated, and the most sensitive polarization observation angle of oil slicks with different refractive indexes is obtained. Results and Discussions The wind speed is set at 5 m/s, with the incident zenith angle set as 15°, 45°, and 56°, and the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated (Fig. 2). The contour of the DOLP of the solar flare is approximately a concentric circle, and the minimum of the DOLP is located at the position corresponding to the incident zenith angle within the incident principal plane. As the incident angle gets larger, the distance between the DOLP contour in the direction perpendicular to the incident principal plane is wider than that in the parallel direction, and the contour features an elliptic shape. According to a specific DOLP of the solar flare, within the incident principal plane, the increase in θs is equal to the decrease in θv. By making the solar incident angle θs is 45°, this paper simulates the distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by oil slicks with three different refractive indexes (Fig. 3). It is shown that the variation rate of the DOLP value with the change in observation geometry is related to the refractive index of sea surface media. When a specific angle is changed in the observation geometry, as the refractive index of sea surface media increases, the variation of the DOLP value becomes slight. In order to improve the oil slick detection sensitivity, the optimum polarization detection area with the largest difference between the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks is simulated. When the incident zenith angle θs =45°, and the observation azimuth angle φv equals 0° and 180° or ranges from 90° to 270°, respectively, the DOLP variation curves with the observation zenith angle φv of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks are simulated and compared (Fig. 4). When the incident angle is big enough, as observation zenith angle increases, the DOLP curves of all media first increase and then decrease. In addition, no matter how θs changes, there is a negative linear correlation between θs and the observation zenith angle θvm corresponding to the most significant DOLP difference between the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks. That means the sum of θs and θvm is a fixed value, which is highly related to the refractive index of oil slicks. Conclusions In this paper, the spatial distribution of DOLP of the solar flare reflected by clean seawater and oil slicks are simulated under various incident and observation geometries based on Cox-Munk probabilistic statistical model. The optimum polarization detection angle of oil slicks with different refractive indexes is determined. It is shown that the incident and observation geometry as well as the refractive index of sea surface media are the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of the DOLP of the solar flare. Furthermore, a lower refractive index of the medium is often accompanied by a higher rate of variation of the DOLP of the solar flare with specific changes in the observation geometry. When the incident zenith angle reaches a certain value, it is possible to observe a positive-to-negative reversal of the difference between the DOLP of the solar flare reflected by seawater and oil slicks within a specific range of azimuth angles of the forward reflection area. For oil slicks with specific refractive indexes, the sum of the optimum polarization detection angle and the solar incident zenith angle is constant, which is closely related to the refractive index of the oil slicks. According to the simulation results, under specific incident and observation geometry, polarization detection can significantly improve the sensitivity of oil spill detection. Therefore, this paper is expected to provide support for the protection of marine environments. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a path-planning problem for stereotactic neurosurgery using concentric tube robots. The main goal is to reach a given region of interest inside the brain, e.g. a tumor, starting from a feasible point on the skull with an ideally short path avoiding certain sensitive brain areas. To describe the shape of the entire cannula from an entry point to the point of interest we use an existing mechanical model for continuum robots. We show numerically that our approach enables the surgeon to reach areas within the brain that would be impossible with a straight cannula as it is currently state of the art. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In our target article (Hamm et al., Legal and Criminological Psychology, 2022), we propose a Concentric Diagram of Legitimacy as an organizing tool for legitimacy theory. In so doing, we hoped to stimulate a scholarly discussion about the state of the literature and the best avenues for pushing past the field’s current intellectual plateau. Six experts took us up on this call and provided three commentaries that push our thinking but, more importantly, identify important opportunities for advancing legitimacy theory. In our response here, we distil their rich insights into key criticisms which then lead to opportunities for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - 3D point clouds can be expected to acquire plant phenotypic traits at present. The damage to crops can be reduced significantly, compared with the traditional manual direct contact measurement. The measurement errors caused by the occlusion between leaves and leaf curl in the two-dimensional images can also be avoided. In this study, a 3D reconstruction system was proposed using Kinect V3, in order to efficiently and accurately reconstruct 3D models of individual crops for the nondestructive measurements of crop phenotype traits by the point cloud. A turntable was also built using a stepping motor. The table surface was designed into multi-color concentric circles. The plane normal vector and central point of the turntable were calculated automatically using concentric circles, which were used for the horizontal alignment of the point cloud and for the calculation of the transformation matrix between multi-view point clouds. The point clouds of crops captured at the multiple view angles by Kinect V3 were transformed to the same coordinate system for the coarse registration using the transformation matrix. Then, the Trimmed Iterative Closest Point (TrICP) was used for the precise registration, thereby completing the 3D reconstruction of individual crops. More importantly, Chinese flowering cabbage and cucumber seedlings were selected as the experimental objects for the 3D reconstruction. Firstly, the reference point clouds were reconstructed by the Multi-View Stereo and Structure From Motion (MVS-SFM). The reason was that the MVS-SFM previously presented sufficient accuracy for the crop 3D reconstruction and high-throughput crop phenotyping analysis. A counting was performed on the distribution frequency for the set of distances between the reconstructed and reference point cloud. The results show that the reconstruction speed of the proposed model was improved by about 90%, compared with the MVS-SFM. In the Chinese flowering cabbage, the average error of distance between the reconstructed and the reference point clouds was 0.59 cm; while 64.45% and 90.63% of the distances sets were less than 0.5 and 1.0 cm, respectively. In the cucumber seedlings, the average error of distance was 0.67cm; while 60.09% and 85.45% of the distances sets were less than 0.5 and 1.0 cm, respectively. Both of the groups showed a high level of overlap. Secondly, the single leaf area was extracted by calculating the area of the surface mesh model that was reconstructed using the Delaunay triangular meshing algorithm. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the average relative error of the Chinese flowering cabbage leaf area were 3.83 cm2 and 5.88%, respectively, compared with the manual measurement using a leaf area meter. The RMSE and the average relative error of cucumber seedling leaf area were 2.08 cm2 and 6.50%, respectively. Both of the groups showed high correlation and accuracy. In addition, the Kinect V3 was compared with the predecessor, Kinect v2, indicating sufficient accuracy for the crop 3D reconstruction. The results show that the Kinect V3 can be used to capture much denser point clouds than the Kinect V2, indicating the high accuracy of crop 3D reconstruction and extraction of leaf area. The proposed model can be expected to quickly reconstruct the individual crops and then effectively extract the leaf area parameters, indicating that it can provide efficient technical tools and data support for crop breeding, cultivation, and agricultural production. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - This article introduces a novel method to calculate the structural sensitivity in non-linear flows. The method is completely data-driven and only uses direct solutions, avoiding the need to calculate the adjoint solution. Moreover, the method can be directly applied to calculate the structural sensitivity in three-dimensional flows. Depending on the nature and the complexity of the data analysed, the methodology presented to calculate this so-called non-linear structural sensitivity, uses dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) or higher order DMD to identify the global modes leading the flow dynamics. The performance of this novel technique has been tested in the two-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds number (Re) 50, 60, 85, 100, 130 and 160, the three-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Re=280 and spanwise wavelength Lz=1.67 and 6.99, in a Food and Drug and Administration nozzle at Re=800 and in two-concentric jets with similar velocity ratio at Re=1500. The results have been compared with the structural sensitivity predicted by the linear theory, finding some similarities and discrepancies between both methods. Nevertheless, the highest structural sensitivity regions identified by this novel algorithm are in good agreement with the literature, where the flow instabilities have been controlled using different mechanisms of passive flow control located in the regions predicted by the non-linear structural sensitivity calculated in this article. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renin-angiotensin system is the main pathophysiological mechanism that mediates the occurrence and development of hypertension. Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can prevent and treat many cardiovascular diseases. However, the optimal exercise prescription for hypertension has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of aerobic exercise on cardiac remodeling and to investigate the possible mechanism of local and systemic renin-angiotensin system in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) METHODS: Thirty male SHR rats were randomly divided into SHR sedentary group and SHR exercise group. At the same time, 15 Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normal blood pressure control group (WKY). The animals in the WKY and SHR sedentary groups were caged and raised quietly, and the SHR exercise group performed moderate intensity treadmill exercise for 8 weeks. After the experiment, caudal artery blood pressure was measured by non-invasive sphygmomanometer. Cardiac structure and function were detected by echocardiography. Myocardial histopathology was observed by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities in serum and heart were measured by fluorescence substrate method, and angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang(1-7) contents in serum and heart were detected by high performance liquid chromatography. The protein expression of ACE, Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), ACE2 and Mas receptor was detected by western blot. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuzhou University of Technology (approval No. XZUTLL 2019-003-02). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Cardiac structure and function: compared with the WKY group, blood pressure increased (P < 0.05), left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis occurred (P < 0.05), and cardiac function decreased (P < 0.05) in SHR sedentary group. Compared with the SHR sedentary group, blood pressure decreased (P < 0.05), left ventricle presented eccentric hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis alleviated (P < 0.05), and cardiac function improved (P < 0.05) in the SHR exercise group. Local (heart) renin-angiotensin system: compared with the SHR sedentary group, cardiac ACE activity and protein expression and Ang II content decreased (P < 0.05), Ang(1-7) content increased (P < 0.05), ACE2 and Mas receptor protein expression upregulated (P < 0.05), ACE/ACE2 activity and protein expression ratio, Ang II/Ang(1-7) content ratio, and AT1R/Mas receptor protein expression ratio decreased (P < 0.05) in the SHR exercise group. Systemic renin-angiotensin system: there was no significant difference in the activity of ACE and ACE2, ACE/ACE2 activity ratio, the content of Ang II and Ang(1-7), and Ang II/Ang(1–7) content ratio of serum in all groups (P > 0.05). To conclude, aerobic exercise regulates local (heart) renin-angiotensin system to shift ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis to ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas receptor axis, thereby inhibiting cardiac remodeling in SHR rats. © 2022, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - I developed a novel image processing method inspired by wavelet transform that uses a concentric mother wavelet. This method can be used for noise filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, and other applications and is effective for images with low spatial frequencies. When filtering small-sized images, setting masks for Fourier filtering is often difficult; however, the proposed method does not require mask setting, thus facilitating filtering. In practice, many concentric mother wavelets of different frequencies are prepared in advance, and the cross-correlation between the input image and prepared wavelets is calculated. Reconstruction or image processing can be easily performed by combining the obtained results for each frequency. I believe that the present method can aid image processing related to material analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many prey species possess eyespots: paired markings that often consist of two or more concentric circles. Predators are wary of such prey because eyespots are conspicuous and/or mistaken for vertebrate eyes. Here we used naïve domestic chicks as predators of artificial moth-like prey to test the hypothesis that both eyespots configuration and predator approach direction affect the antipredator efficacy of eyespots. We found that when chicks approached prey straight on, eyespots configuration did not influence attack latency. Chicks that approached from either the left or the right, were slower to attack prey in which the central circle of the eyespot was centrally placed or shifted in the direction of the chick’s approach, compared to prey in which the central circle had been shifted away from the direction of approach. These findings suggest that eyespots composed of concentric circles may protect prey against predators approaching from a wider range of directions than eyespots composed of eccentric circles. They are also consistent with the idea that eyespots are mistaken for eyes, and are perceived to pose a lesser risk when their “gaze” is averted from the approaching predator.

AB  - A topology optimization method for the design of thermal cloak is proposed. The thermal scattering theory is introduced to pre-define the initial topology of the thermal invisible cloak as two layers to reduce the number of design variables. In bilayer concentric rings, insulating and high thermal conductivity materials are used to mask heat flow and correct thermal properties. Topology optimization based on the CMA-ES strategy is applied to quickly obtain the best configuration of available materials. The influence of the thermal properties of the material on the optimal configuration and the deflection angle of the thermal flux at the boundary surface has been investigated. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the function of the optimal cloak with that of the ideal metamaterial and the single insulating layer. The results show that despite its simple structure, the bilayer scattering cloak exhibits excellent cloaking performance under different thermal boundary conditions. In this work, the perfect scattering elimination is achieved by adjusting the layer thickness ratio of the cloak with the initial defined structure rather than seeking the optimal thermal conductivity of material, so as to avoid the problem of mismatch between the actual and ideal parameters. Compared to continuous optimization method, the pre-defined bilayer structure is easy to manufacture. Our scheme introduces thermal scattering theory to pre-set the initial structure of the topology optimization method, which provides a general, convenient, and efficient means for the design and application of thermally functional materials. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A common pre-season injury prevention assessment conducted by professional football clubs is the hamstring-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio calculated by peak torque (PT). However, it is debatable whether players that present low pre-season H:Q ratios are more susceptible to further sustaining in-season hamstring strain injuries (HSI). Based upon retrospective data from a Brazilian Serie A football squad, a particular season came to our attention as ten out of seventeen (~59%) professional male football players sustained HSI. Therefore, we examined the pre-season H:Q ratios of these players. H:Q conventional (CR) and functional (FR) ratios, and the respective knee extensor/flexor PT from the limbs of players further sustaining in-season HSI (injured players, IP) were compared to the proportional number of dominant/non-dominant limbs from uninjured players (UP) in the squad. FR and CR were ~18–22% lower (p < 0.01), whereas quadriceps concentric PT was ~25% greater for IP than UP (p = 0.002). Low scores of FR and CR were correlated (p < 0.01) with high levels of quadriceps concentric PT (r = −0.66 to −0.77). In conclusion, players who sustained in-season HSI had lower pre-season FR and CR compared to UP, which appears to be associated with higher levels of quadriceps concentric torque than hamstring concentric or eccentric torque. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - We study the collective motion of autonomous mobile agents on a ringlike environment. The agents’ dynamics is inspired by known laboratory experiments on the dynamics of locust swarms. In these experiments, locusts placed at arbitrary locations and initial orientations on a ring-shaped arena are observed to eventually all march in the same direction. In this work we ask whether, and how fast, a similar phenomenon occurs in a stochastic swarm of simple agents whose goal is to maintain the same direction of motion for as long as possible. The agents are randomly initiated as marching either clockwise or counterclockwise on a wide ring-shaped region, which we model as k “narrow” concentric tracks on a cylinder. Collisions cause agents to change their direction of motion. To avoid this, agents may decide to switch tracks so as to merge with platoons of agents marching in their direction. We prove that such agents must eventually converge to a local consensus about their direction of motion–all agents on each narrow track must eventually march in the same direction. We give asymptotic bounds for the expected amount of time it takes for such convergence or “stabilization” to occur, which depends on the number of agents, the length of the tracks, and the number of tracks. We show that when agents also have a small probability of “erratic”, random track-jumping behaviour, a global consensus on the direction of motion across all tracks must eventually occur. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings in numerical simulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We study the problem of motion planning for a collection of n labeled unit disc robots in a polygonal environment. We assume that the robots have revolving areas around their start and final positions: that each start and each final is contained in a radius 2 disc lying in the free space, not necessarily concentric with the start or final position, which is free from other start or final positions. This assumption allows a weakly-monotone motion plan, in which robots move according to an ordering as follows: during the turn of a robot R in the ordering, it moves fully from its start to final position, while other robots do not leave their revolving areas. As R passes through a revolving area, a robot R′ that is inside this area may move within the revolving area to avoid a collision. Notwithstanding the existence of a motion plan, we show that minimizing the total traveled distance in this setting, specifically even when the motion plan is restricted to be weakly-monotone, is APX-hard, ruling out any polynomial-time (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm. On the positive side, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for computing a feasible weakly-monotone motion plan. The total distance traveled by the robots is within an O(1) factor of that of the optimal motion plan, which need not be weakly monotone. Our algorithm extends to an online setting in which the polygonal environment is fixed but the initial and final positions of robots are specified in an online manner. Finally, we observe that the overhead in the overall cost that we add while editing the paths to avoid robot-robot collision can vary significantly depending on the ordering we chose. Finding the best ordering in this respect is known to be NP-hard, and we provide a polynomial time O(log n log log n)-approximation algorithm for this problem. © Pankaj K.

AB  - Although numerous studies about camouflage have been conducted in the last few decades, there is still a significant gap in our knowledge about the magnitude of protective value of different camouflage strategies in prey detection and survival. Furthermore, the functional significance of several camouflage strategies remains controversial. Here we carried out a comprehensive meta-analysis including comparisons of different camouflage strategies as well as predator and prey types, considering two response variables: mean predator search time (ST) (63 studies) and predator attack rate (AR) of camouflaged prey (28 studies). Overall, camouflage increased the predator ST by 62.56% and decreased the AR of prey by 27.34%. Masquerade was the camouflage strategy that most increased predator ST (295.43%). Background matching and disruptive coloration did not differ from each other. Motion camouflage did not increase ST but decreases AR on prey. We found no evidence that eyespot increases ST and decreases AR by predators. The different types of predators did not differ from each other, but caterpillars were the type of prey that most influenced the magnitude of camouflage's effect. We highlight the potential evolutionary mechanisms that led camouflage to be a highly effective anti-predatory adaptation, as well as potential discrepancies or redundancies among strategies, predator and prey types. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the most promising Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques. FDM technique is capable to print continuous fibre reinforced composite (CFRP). Both researchers and the industrial community are becoming interested in this area. In the present work, Kevlar fibre reinforced composite (KFRCP) was fabricated using Fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique. Onyx material is used as matrix material and continuous kevlar fibre as reinforcement. In this present work influence of the following parameters has been investigated: effect of an increase in kevlar fibre reinforcement starting from 0, 2 to 10 layers in a step-wise manner on tensile strength. An effect of change in kevlar fibre direction, as well as configuration (isotropic, concentric pattern) on tensile strength by fixing 10 layers of kevlar reinforcement. A tensile test was conducted on the specimen in compliance with ASTMD3039. Young’s modulus and stress had been calculated based on experimental results. It was observed that the overall strength of KFRCP was twenty times more compared to virgin CFRP (only onyx). Kevlar fibre has the poorest wettability with the matrix. Poor wettability and lack of impregnation between fibre and matrix result in delamination. Furthermore, delamination with an increase in reinforcement in the FDM process is also discussed. The results obtained will aid designers to select appropriate fibre direction and orientation while developing FRCP parts to prevent delamination. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Eyespots are taxonomically widespread color patterns consisting of large concentric rings that are commonly assumed to protect prey by influencing the behaviors of predators. Although there is ample experimental evidence supporting an anti-predator function of eyespots in terrestrial animals, whether eyespots have a similar deterring function in aquatic animals remains unclear. Furthermore, studies in terrestrial systems suggest that the protective function of eyespots depends on ambient light conditions where predators encounter them, but this effect has never been tested in aquatic environments. Here, we examine how eyespots influence behavioral responses in an aquatic environment under different visual environments, using laboratory-reared three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as model predators. Specifically, we experimentally examined behavioral responses of sticklebacks toward artificial prey patterns (control vs. eyespots) under two different light environment treatments (low vs. high). We found that eyespots did not postpone attacks from sticklebacks. However, sticklebacks approaching eyespots stopped more frequently than sticklebacks approaching prey items with a control pattern. Sticklebacks were (marginally) slower to attack prey in the low-light treatment, but the light level did not influence stickleback behavioral responses toward eyespots. We conclude that eyespots can modulate some behaviors of an aquatic predator, albeit with a different functional role from that previously demonstrated in terrestrial species. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - While openings are an essential requirement in buildings as a source of access, fresh air and sunlight, these openings cause a reduction in the lateral stiffness and torsional resistance of masonry wall units. A detailed numerical investigation was carried out to explore the impact of the opening percentage on the in-plane stiffness and lateral strength of unconfined and confined masonry wall panels prepared using calcium silicate bricks, for sustainable masonry structures. A commercially available FEM package (ANSYS) was used to carry out comparative analysis of ten wall panels, five of each type (confined and unconfined masonry walls) with concentrically located openings of varying sizes (0% to 16.5%). A simplified micro-modeling technique following the Newton Raphson Algorithm was adopted. Results revealed that the confined masonry approach unveiled a more reliable anti-seismic response along with improved in-plane strength in the case of confined masonry walls. The failure type shifted from pure flexural to more of a blend of shear and flexure after the opening percentage increased to 10.09% in unconfined masonry walls, which was not the case where confinement was provided. Based on the outcomes, it is strongly recommended to adopt confined masonry in highly seismic-prone areas to avoid catastrophic damage caused by earthquakes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The Brassolini are among the most noticeable Neotropical butterflies. The adults have showy colorful wings with conspicuous eyespots on the ventral surface. Although Brassolini monophyly is recovered in recent phylogenies, some relationships among their genera remain uncertain and the shortage of information about the immature stages of the tribe probably contributes to the lack of understanding of its systematics. Blepolenis Röber, 1906 is a small brassoline genus and the morphology of its immature stages remains largely unknown. In order to provide new data on the morphology and natural history of Blepolenis and contribute to the systematics of the Brassolini, we here describe and illustrate the immature stages of Blepolenis bassus (C. Felder & R. Felder, 1867). The immatures of Blepolenis bassus show a general morphology similar to other Brassolini immatures. The first instar B. bassus head has two types of setae and the body bears filiform setae (F). The pupa lacks the lateral mirrored spot, seen on known pupae of closely related groups, such as Opsiphanes Doubleday, [1849]. B. bassus larvae feed on Saccharum villosum Steud. (Poaceae) remaining on their hostplant for about one year, and are univoltine, with adults flying in December and January. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - To improve the control accuracy of robot joints under the influence of coupling, this paper uses a decoupling control method based on the coupling principle analysis to solve the kinematic and dynamic coupling caused by a three-axis concentric hip joint structure, taking the right leg of a 23 degree-of-freedom bipedal humanoid robot as the research object. Simscape is chosen to simulate the physical model of the right leg. And the Active Disturbance Rejection Decoupled Controller with a nonlinear Extended State Observer is designed, in which the derived gravity compensation is added to reduce the control difficulty and improve the observation accuracy. The initial value peaking is avoided by clipping the observer output. The simulation results show that, compared with the PID control with gravity feedback and coupling compensation, ADRDC has better dynamic and steady-state performance, higher position tracking accuracy and stronger anti-interference ability. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The knee-joint isokinetic profile (KJIP) injury risk factor may be modulated by chronological age, however, comparative data for elite male soccer players aged 25 years and older is lacking. Objective: To describe and compare the knee-joint isokinetic profile (KJIP) according to the chronological age of professional male soccer players. Method: In a cross-sectional study design, sixty-three soccer athletes from the first Chilean soccer division (A-series) were divided into younger and older groups (age ≤ 25 years; n = 35 and age > 25 years; n = 28, respectively). In both groups the IPKJ was assessed at 60°.s-1 in concentric mode. Results: The older group had lower extensor peak torque (p < .05). The younger group showed correlations between flexors peak torque and extensors mean power (p < .001). In the older group, flexors peak torque and flexors mean power were correlated. The flexors peak torque, total work, and mean power symmetric index (SI) exhibited values > 10 % for both groups. The extensors SI showed values > 10 % for mean power, although only in the older group. Conclusion: Several differences in the KJIP were noted between professional male soccer players aged ≤ 25 years and > 25 years. Current results offer injury prevention insights, discussed in the current manuscript. © 2022 The authors.

AB  - Background: Running is a very popular activity and muscle strength imbalance has been treated with caution to prevent injuries. Aim: The present study aimed to compare and correlate knee flexion and extension strength imbalance based on peak torque (PT) and total work (TW) in running athletes. Methods: Thirty-eight male amateur running athletes (38 ± 6 years; 80.6 ± 8.3 kg; 177 ± 7 cm; 7.8 ± 8.4 years of training; 3.5 ± 0.9 training sessions a week; 33.5 ± 13.4 km of training per week) took part in the present study. Knee flexion eccentric and concentric PT and TW, as well as concentric knee extension PT and TW were assessed. PT- and TW-based hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (H:Q), as well as PT and TW contralateral imbalance were quantified. Results: A significant correlation was observed between TW and PT concentric knee flexion contralateral deficits (r = 0.52, p < 0.001). No further correlations were found among TW- and PT-based muscle strength imbalance variables (p > 0.05). All mean comparisons of H:Q and contralateral imbalances using TW or PT were significantly different (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that TW and PT muscle strength imbalance were unrelated, and the H:Q and contralateral imbalance profile of endurance runners may differ based on the isokinetic variable analyzed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - When we look to ourselves as living creatures, a substantial parallel with animal forms of life seems to suggest itself readily. The specifics of human love would then consist in the fact that the members of the relation take on a mental distance to their connection and the cooperative effect that are generated in love. From this distance, love can be assessed and judged as love. Personal creatures share an excentric distance from their concentric modes of behavior. Concentricity is understood as the unity in behavior between an organism and something else in the environment. Excentricity means that persons, as participants in mind, are set outside these concentrics in a world. At the same time, persons remain living creatures who cannot do without the exercise of their concentricity. Richard Shusterman rediscovered Eros as the attractive mover of our living body to frame reconcentric levels in excentric levels of conduct. Scheler's positioning of love within the sensible order of the emotional life of persons avoids an overly hasty reduction of the relations of love into states, types of actions, moods, feelings of empathy, sympathy and affects. Love moves these foregrounds from the background where the beloved could thrive in its world. Plessner discusses the categorical subjunctive of passion in terms of the use of personal pronouns, above all the use of the 'I'. On the one hand 'I' is used to refer to the person's own conduct of life with their lived body here and now, which for the person cannot be substituted or exchanged by anything else. On the other hand, all persons say 'I' to themselves and others, and in doing so they make use of an anonymous structure that has intersubjectively. In this function of bringing out mental contents, all persons are exchangeable and replaceable and can represent one another. Hence an antimony emerges in the exercise of the I-position. In the relation of love, the “you” is to become “I”, a “categorical irreality” (Plessner) in light of which nevertheless life is effectively conducted in an imagined phantasm. How can we understand this phantasm? Beside the change of personal pronouns, our grammar offers the difference of indicative, imperative and subjunctive to share shifts between imagined perspectives and positions. That which is expressed in the indicative and imperative grows historically out of the disappointments and limitations of the categorical subjunctive in love. The excentricity of positionality, which seemed to be only a mental distance, emerges from a valuable relation of love for a world of the beloved. In excentricity one is beside oneself with love. © 2022 Central European Pragmatist Forum. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacillus subtilis spores are encased in two concentric shells: an outer proteinaceous “coat” and an inner peptidoglycan “cortex,” separated by a membrane. Cortex assembly depends on coat assembly initiation, but how cells achieve this coordination across the membrane is unclear. Here, we report that the protein SpoVID monitors the polymerization state of the coat basement layer via an extension to a functional intracellular LysM domain that arrests sporulation when coat assembly is initiated improperly. Whereas extracellular LysM domains bind mature peptidoglycan, SpoVID LysM binds to the membrane-bound lipid II peptidoglycan precursor. We propose that improper coat assembly exposes the SpoVID LysM domain, which then sequesters lipid II and prevents cortex assembly. SpoVID defines a widespread group of firmicute proteins with a characteristic N-terminal domain and C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domains that might combine coat and cortex assembly roles to mediate a developmental checkpoint linking the morphogenesis of two spatially separated supramolecular structures. © 2021

AB  - The goal of this research was to investigate the communication channels that enhance data sharing among agriculture researchers in Tanzania. Specifically, the study aimed to identify communication channels that are used by agricultural researchers in Tanzania, examine the extent to which such channels were used to enhance data sharing among agricultural researchers, and examine the factors that influence the choices of channels used in data sharing. A descriptive cross-sectional design, alongside quantitative, and qualitative approaches, was employed to collect data from 204 respondents. The Concentric Layered Model for the channel choices was used to guide this study. Results indicate that both mediated, and non-medi-ated channels existed and were used as data-sharing avenues and channels. The majority of the researchers (77.9%) preferred to use non-mediated chan-nels. Also, the findings indicate that more than 50% of respondents agreed that timely delivery, the cost of the channel, and convenience of a channel were among the factors influencing researchers in their channel selection. It can be concluded therefore that research institutions should invest in mediated channels that have been underutilized to strengthen data-sharing practices among researchers. © 2023, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

AB  - Many animals use shading to infer the three-dimensional (3D) shape of objects, and mimicking natural shading patterns can produce the illusion of 3D form on a flat surface. Over 150 years ago, Charles Darwin noted that the ocelli (eyespots) on the feathers of the great argus Argusianus argus, when held vertically during courtship displays to females, were perfectly shaded to resemble 3D hemispheres to human viewers. We tested whether these ocelli appear 3D to birds by training chickens Gallus gallus domesticus to select images of either convex or concave shapes using shading cues, and then presenting them with images of great argus ocelli. Chickens successfully learned how to discriminate between convex and concave shapes, and treated the great argus pheasant ocelli in the same way as convex training stimuli. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that birds can perceive 3D shape from shading cues in a similar manner to humans. The perception of great argus ocelli as consistent with 3D shape by avian viewers suggests that shape illusions can play a role in male courtship.  © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives/Scope: Wellbore enlargement technique such as hydraulic fracturing or frac packing (or extension pack using linear gel) treatment is very much required in the brown field reservoirs with unconsolidated sands, poor sorting, and uniformity coefficient as well as very high fine content. The cost escalates when this requirement happens for multiple zones which needs longer rig time. This paper will discuss on the execution part of 7" ESTMZ system deployment, extension pack design, lessons learnt and required mitigation on the system itself. Conventionally, most of the operator will perform extension pack operation using stack-pack technique which required longer rig time, due to repetition of perforation, deburring and installation of gravel pack assembly which followed by gravel placement operation based on number of zones. Further optimization is the Single Trip Multi Zone (STMZ) system developed to enable multi zones gravel placement treatment and installation done in single trip in order to reduce the rig time. However, the 7" STMZ system is still have some limitation on its pumping capability due to system design and high friction pressure hence unable to be used for any frac-pack or extension pack treatment. Methods, Procedures, Process: The next generation of 7" ESTMZ system was introduced to overcome all the limitation of its predecessor and enables the frac-pack operation to be performed in a single trip manner which assuredly reduced considerable rig days. Furthermore, this system can eliminate deployment of inner string inside lower completion assemblies for zonal isolation and reservoir selectivity which can be risky especially in highly deviated wells. This system comes with modular screen design with integrated sliding sleeve with proprietary shifting profile. Like the conventional stack pack system, a sump packer will be run in hole via wireline and tractor as a base for sump area and depth reference. Then, the well is perforated with oriented gun and selected perforation technique for all zones in a single trip followed by debur run using wellbore clean out BHA. ESTMZ assembly is deployed to cover all zones with single concentric wash pipe system for the treatment. The zone interval length and zonal spacing are fully independent and may come with various length as oppose to the STMZ system. Hence, no dummy zone is required. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The gravel placement design for this particular field was designed precisely to contain the growth to avoid fracturing into the nearby coal, shale, and water contact region. As a result, the reservoirs were successfully treated with extension pack of 220lb/ft packing factor at highest proppant concentration of 4.8ppg and 10bpm pumping rate. Novel/Additive Information: The technology discussed in this paper is a first in the world application in highly deviated well category where the author is intended to register the pain points as well as best practices to be replicated.

AB  - Predation of seeds of the cycad Dioon edule by mice has been previously documented, demonstrating that the seeds’ toxins are not harmful when combined with a varied diet. However, there is scarce evidence that they are a seed disperser. In a tropical oak forest in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, we experimented with seeds of D. edule and Quercus polymorpha, evaluating predators’ preference and recording it with phototrapping. Burrows were sampled in concentric circles around a D. edule mother plant, and the types of burrows and condition of the seeds inside were identified with a borescope without destroying the burrows. The structure and composition of the forest were evaluated. The primary dispersion of D. edule seeds is by barochory. The rodents predate on seeds and prefer Q. polymorpha over D. edule (survival: 48.9% and 78.5%, respectively). There are more escape and multiple burrows at 3–6 m with mature oaks. Rodents forget or abandon D. edule seeds in the burrows, and such seeds germinate at 3–6 m. Peromyscus leucopus is a short-distance secondary disperser and predator of D. edule seeds. © the Author(s), 2021 | Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.

AB  - Cloaking is typically reciprocal. Here, we introduce the concept of transmittable nonreciprocal cloaking, whereby the cloaking system operates as a standard omnidirectional cloak for external illumination but can transmit light from its center outward at will. We demonstrate a specific implementation of such cloaking that consists of a set of concentric bianisotropic metasurfaces, the innermost element of which is nonreciprocal and designed to simultaneously block inward waves and pass - either omnidirectionally or directionally - outward waves. Such cloaking represents a fundamental diversification of conventional cloaking and may find applications in areas such as stealth, blockage avoidance, illusion, and cooling.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

AB  - Background: Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) induces heightened ethanol intake at adolescence in preclinical studies. Ethanol intake alters the absorption of folate, a methyl-group donor critical for numerous cellular functions. The prenatal administration of folate is, therefore, a promising approach to reduce the effects of PEE. Objectives: Experiment 1 determined if prenatal folate modulated the effects of PEE on ethanol intake, anxiety-like response, and exploratory behaviors (Experiment 1) in Wistar rats. Experiment 2 assessed, in rats not given PEE, if postnatal folate reversed effects of ethanol exposure at postnatal days 28–42. Experiment 3 assessed if folate altered blood ethanol levels (BELs). Methods: Experiment 1 involved 242 (125 male) adolescent Wistar rats derived from dams given folate (20 mg/kg, gestational days–GD- 13-20) + ethanol (2.0 g/kg, GD 17–20), ethanol, or vehicle only at pregnancy. Experiment 2 involved 29 male adolescents administered vehicle or ethanol doses co-administered or not with folate. In Experiment 3 twelve adult females were tested for BELs after folate administration. These tests were applied: intake tests, light dark box (LDB), elevated plus maze, open field and concentric square field. Results: PEE heightened ethanol intake (η2 ps = 0.06–07) and induced hyperactivity and a reduced latency to exit the white area of the LDB (η2 ps = 0.12–17). These effects were partially inhibited by folate (p >.05). Rats exposed to ethanol exposure at adolescence exhibited reduced motor activity (η2 p =.17), regardless of folate treatment. Folate did not affect BELs. Conclusion: Folate administration should be considered as a preventive or acute treatment to attenuate the neurobehavioral effects of PEE. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Drop jump (DJ) is a kind of plyometric training. There is little research on the effect of drop height (DH) on unilateral DJ. This study explored the optimal DH of DJ by unilateral lower limb, aiming to provide a reference for males with different exercise levels to avoid the imbalance between bilateral lower limbs and for coaches to develop accurate and effective unilateral DJ training programs. Methods: 18 college athletes and 13 physically active students were recruited to participate in this study and then asked to take three tests, namely “single-leg DJ at low height (L- SLDJ)”, “single-leg DJ at medium height (M-SLDJ)”, and “single-leg DJ at high height (H-SLDJ)”. Motion Capture System and Force Plate were used to synchronously collect motion parameters. Results: At M-SLDJ, both dominant and non-dominant legs performed significantly better than those at the other two types of DH in terms of leg stiffness and power for males with different exercise levels. At H-SLDJ, for males with different exercise levels, dominant leg had significantly better performance in leg stiffness, power etc. than non-dominant leg. Conclusions: The M-SLDJ designed in this study can be used by college athletes or students majoring in physical education for unilateral lower limb DJ training to maximize the performance of dominant or non-dominant leg. Due to the significant difference between two legs in the case of H-SLDJ, the eccentric contraction ability and stability of the non-dominant leg should be enhanced during the training to avoid bilateral imbalance. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - We study the collective motion of autonomous mobile agents in a ringlike environment. The agents’ dynamics are inspired by known laboratory experiments on the dynamics of locust swarms. In these experiments, locusts placed at arbitrary locations and initial orientations on a ring-shaped arena are observed to eventually all march in the same direction. In this work we ask whether, and how fast, a similar phenomenon occurs in a stochastic swarm of simple locust-inspired agents. The agents are randomly initiated as marching either clockwise or counterclockwise on a discretized, wide ring-shaped region, which we subdivide into k concentric tracks of length n. Collisions cause agents to change their direction of motion. To avoid this, agents may decide to switch tracks to merge with platoons of agents marching in their direction. We prove that such agents must eventually converge to a local consensus about their direction of motion, meaning that all agents on each narrow track must eventually march in the same direction. We give asymptotic bounds for the expected time it takes for such convergence or “stabilization” to occur, which depends on the number of agents, the length of the tracks, and the number of tracks. We show that when agents also have a small probability of “erratic”, random track-jumping behavior, a global consensus on the direction of motion across all tracks will eventually be reached. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings in numerical simulations. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The eastern margin of Ordos Basin has a huge amount of coalbed methane resources, and has become one of the main coalbed methane producing areas in China. Since the development of the block, hydraulic rodless pump, hydraulic jet pump, electric submersible pump and diaphragm pump drainage and production process tests have been carried out for highly deviated wells and horizontal wells in medium shallow coal seam. During production, it is found that the above four types of rodless drainage and production processes have the advantages of effectively avoiding eccentric wear of pipes and rods in highly deviated wells and horizontal wells, however, they have general ability to prevent pulverized coal and sand, corrosion and scale and some disadvantages such as the risk of high-pressure puncture and leakage, the limited depth of lowering the pump, and the poor reliability of ground equipment. By analyzing the test results of rodless drainage technology of medium shallow coalbed methane wells in the early stage of the block, the advantages and disadvantages of various rodless drainage technologies are summarized, and the improvement direction of rodless drainage technology of medium shallow coalbed methane wells is pointed out. At present, as the exploration and development field of coalbed methane has gradually shifted from medium shallow coal seam to deep coal seam, the original rodless drainage and production process of medium shallow coalbed methane wells has been unable to meet the drainage and gas production demand of deep coalbed methane wells. In view of the geological characteristics of deep coalbed methane, such as “development of primary structure coal, high formation pressure, high gas content, high saturation, coexistence of free gas and adsorbed gas” and the production characteristics of “early gas breakthrough and high gas-liquid ratio”, it is considered that the rodless drainage process of deep coalbed methane wells needs to jump out of the rodless drainage process of medium shallow coalbed methane wells. We can learn from the gas production process experience of pilot test wells of tight gas and sea land transitional phase shale gas in the block, and carry out the tests of “concentric pipe gas lift”, “small tubing + bubble drainage” and “coiled tubing + plunger + gas lift” on the production site, which can effectively avoid the shortcomings of the traditional rodless drainage process and realize the efficient development of deep coalbed methane.

AB  - Objective The blurred image based target recognition issue is essential to computer vision and pattern recogni-tion. In the process of camera imaging exposure, Image degradation is affected by varied environmental and practical factors like atmospheric interference, camera defocus, relative motion between camera and scene. Therefore, the ideal image features should be invariant to these changes. Image motion blur is caused by and relative motion between camera and scene in the process of exposure time. It can be regarded as the integral of image density function in a certain time interval. According to the motion form of the camera relative to the scene in the three-dimensional space in the exposure time, the motion blur of the image can be divided into linear motion blur, rotational motion blur, radial motion blur and other more complex motion blur formed by the superposition of the above three kinds of blurs. In particular, captured images of high-speed rotating status will produce rotational motion blur. In the aspect of pattern recognition of motion blurred image, most of the works choose the strategy of “deblurring”. They carry on the next level image processing after restoring the blurred image as clear as possible. If the preprocessing process of image restoration is eliminated and the image features with motion blur invariance are extracted directly, the efficiency of image recognition will be accelerated. Therefore, recent invariant features constructed motion blurred images has become an important research direction in the field of image recognition. Our research method is focused on sort the invariant features out between original image and blurred image through the mathematical model of blurring and the theory of moment invariants. Method When there is relative motion between the object and the photosensitive element, distorted accumulation of light on the imaging plane will occur in one shutter time, resulting in motion blurred image. The blur path can be regarded as a series of concentric circles centered on the camera and the object in terms of axial rotation between the sensor and the object. The rotational motion of variable speed can be decomposed into standardized multiple rotational motions due to the extremely glimpsed shutter time. We will focus on the rotational motion blur standardization related to known rotation center and constant angular velocity based on degraded model of rotation motion blur and Gaussian-Hermite moment. Our method demonstrated the rotational motion blur Gaussian-Hermite moment built issues and facilitated the existing of low-rank rotational motion blur Gaussian-Hermite moment invariants. Correspondingly, the formation of this kind of image is the superposition mean value of the results of a series of rotation transformations on the original image based on the rotation motion blur degradation model. We illustrated that the rotational motion blur Gaussian-Hermite moments is a linear combination of the Gaussian-Hermite moments of the original image. The construction process of rotational motion blur invariants is the process of eliminating the coefficients of Gaussian-Hermite moments of the original image based on Gaussian-Hermite moments. In this way, Gaussian-Hermite moment based rotational motion blur invariants on is built. We filtrated 5 Gaussian-Hermite moment invariants from exiting rotational geometry moment invariants which had been extended to Gaussian-Hermite moment invariants to construct a highly stable 5-dimensional feature vector and named it as rotational motion blur Gaussian-Hermite moment invariants (RMB_ GHMI-5), and we verified that RMB_ GHMI-5 had great properties of invariability and distinguishability. Finally, we introduced RMB_ GHMI-5 to the field of image retrieval. Result In invariance experiment, we validated the invariance ability of the feature vector on the dataset University of Southern California — Signal and Image Processing Institute (USC-SIPI). Two sets of 18 composited blurred images have been made to test RMB_ GHMI-5. Our results demonstrate that the feature distance between original image and composited blurred image are extremely weak, which means RMB_ GHMI-5 has great invariant attributes. In addition to the image retrieval experiments, we introduce two image datasets in the context of Flavia and Butterfly for original image. Such composited images are blurred of different degree of rotation, rotational motion and Gaussian noise or salt-pepper noise has been used to validate the invariability and distinguishability of RMB_ GHMI-5. Compared to 4 distinctive saliency approaches related to leaf images, rotated degrading, rotational motion and Gaussian noise at 80% recall rate, the recognition accuracy of RMB_ GHMI-5 is 25. 89% higher than salt-pepper noise (39. 95%), Poisson noise (22. 79%) and multiplicative noise (35. 80%). For Butterfly Images degraded by rotation, rotational motion and Gaussian noise at 80% recall rate, the recognition accuracy of RMB_ GHMI-5 is 7. 18% higher than salt-pepper noise (39. 95%), Poisson noise (22. 79%) and multiplicative noise (35. 80%). Conclusion We proposed a 5-dimensional feature vector RMB_ GHMI-5 which is invariable for rotational motion blur based on Gaussian-Hermite moments. We verified that RMB_ GHMI-5 had great potentials of invariability and distinguishability in the field of image retrieval. Our experimental results demonstrate that RMB_ GHMI-5 has its priority related to current saliency approaches. © 2022 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experiments have been conducted to study the effect of louvered strip-coiled spring (PLSCS) turbulators having different pitches and the same angle of attack on thermal performance and pressure drop of a concentric tube heat exchanger. Two inserts in combined form were used for experimentation under turbulent flow at different Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging between 5000 and 20,000. Two pitches (40 mm and 50 mm) of elliptical-shaped perforated louvered strips (PLS) having the same angles of attack (Formula presented.) have been taken that were welded on the central core rod. Spring inserts have the same coil diameter of 12 mm with two varying pitches to achieve pitch ratios (Formula presented.) of 0.5 and 1. Both heat transfer and pressure drop increase with a decrease in pitches of both LS and spring inserts. Nusselt number has the maximum value with spring of pitch 6 mm in combination with a PLS of 40 mm pitch at (Formula presented.) which is 130.75% higher than the plain tube at the lowest Re among the PLSCS inserts. With perforation, a slight increase in both Nusselt number and friction factor was observed. The maximum thermal performance efficiency value is 1.105 for the lowest Re value. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The first fossil Typhlocybinae inclusions from Eocene Rovno amber are described and illustrated. They include two new monotypic genera of the extinct tribe Protodikraneurini, Retrorsotettix n. gen. with type species R. vlaskini n. sp. and Protoparallaxis n. gen. with type species P. clavatus n. sp. Also described and illustrated are two new monotypic genera of the extant tribe Dikraneurini, Eodikraneura n. gen. with type species E. obscura n. sp. and Rovnodikra n. gen. with type species Rovnodikra longipes n. sp. Retrorsotettix is the oldest leafhopper known to exhibit a false eyespot and false leg markings on the forewing, representing an early acquisition of a defensive strategy against visual predators. Appearance of a small insect with false eyespots in the Eocene fossil record may reflect increased pressure by visual predators, especially crown ornithuromorph insectivorous birds. Such birds and small insect prey with false eyespots remain unknown in the Cretaceous. Eodikraneura exhibits a unique condition of the hind wing venation in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are confluent for a short distance but then diverge before separately reaching the submarginal vein. This presumably represents a morphological transition between the Protodikraneurini, in which hind-wing radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely separate and connected by a radial-medial crossvein, and Dikraneurini, in which radius posterior and media anterior veins are completely confluent distally. A key to genera of Protodikraneurini is provided. UUID: http://zoobank.org/f15e6f80-9708-4f5e-89a3-705f9d340a77  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Ecotourism provides an opportunity to experience nature that may promote its conservation. Ecotourists photograph wildlife, and photography plays an important role in focusing public's attention on nature. Although photography is believed to be a low-impact activity, how the visual stimulus of cameras influences wildlife remains unknown. Since animals are known to fear eyes pointed towards them because of similarity to predator eyes, we predicted that cameras with zoom lens would increase vigilance. Using yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and adopting a behavioural approach to identify marmots' response to photography, we experimentally quantified proportion of time allocated to vigilance during foraging and flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which a marmot started to flee from an approaching human) towards humans with and without a camera. We focused on time allocated to vigilance measured in three ways: the proportion of time when marmots moved their head and body towards observers (looking towards observer), the proportion of time when marmots moved their head away from observers (looking away from observer) and the total vigilance (sum of looking towards and away from observer). While a camera was pointed at a marmot, individuals allocated more time to looking towards the observer and less time to looking away from the observer than they did without a camera. However, the total proportion of time allocated to vigilance was not different when marmots were approached by humans with and without a camera. Additionally, whether or not an observer was carrying a camera had no effect on FID. Our results indicated that cameras distracted marmots but did not influence their subsequent risk assessment; marmots may be curious about cameras but were not threatened by them. However, capturing an individual's attention may reduce their ability to look out for predators and thus may increase vulnerability to predation. Regulating photography in locations where predation risk is high or vulnerable species ranges' overlap with humans may be required. © 2022 Zoological Society of London.

AB  - Grounded in hedonic assumptions, evidence suggests that people tend to engage in activities they consider pleasurable and enjoyable, while trying to avoid pain and displeasure. This suggests that the dynamic between positive and negative affect can influence current behavior and the intentions to continue performing. Regarding resistance training (RT), research focusing on how to promote a better affective response is still scarce and much needed. Given existing limitations and theoretical suggestions, a RT program was developed and applied to recreational exercisers in a quasi-experimental design aiming to (1) explore the affective response dynamic through an assessment after the last set of each exercise; and (2) analyze possible differences of preference and tolerance profiles in affective variables (core affect and enjoyment). For that purpose, 43 participants (21 male and 22 female; Mage = 34.69 ± 6.71 years; Mexperience = 8.32 ± 4.54 years; MBMI = 24.26 ± 2.64 kg/m2) accepted to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics, correlational, and group comparisons analyses were performed to provide evidence for proposed objectives. The present study showed that measures of affective valence/arousal applied immediately after a set represents a feasible and ecologically valid approach to tap core affect. Results presented evidence that recreationally trained exercisers in a common RT program would need a minimum of one measurement to assess the affective response. However, additional assessments could refine the understanding of exercise pleasurable experience. Results also suggest that exercisers with distinct profiles of preference/tolerance depicted differentiated patterns for the affective response, possibly justifying a distinct approach when promoting affective regulation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - In fused filament fabrication (FFF), it is important to control the extrusion process for different materials and extruder hardware precisely. The effective extrusion force on the nozzle allows the characterization of the flow behaviour of the molten polymer. Therefore, integrating compact force sensors into the extrusion unit allows the identification of suitable process windows for different materials and the evaluation of hardware. However, actual setups are not compact and restriction-free. This paper presents a new compact and concentric setup, which allows an accurate measurement of the forces in the extruder avoiding parasitic effects. Furthermore, the test rig and the calibration process including influencing factors such as filament contact force and extrusion height is described. On this basis, a varying parameter study using different nozzles, feeding velocities, and temperatures is conducted. The recorded values of the extrusion force are compared with the literature values and the flow behaviour is assigned to the corresponding nozzle geometry. It has been shown that the calibrated test rig is able to measure the extrusion force with sufficient accuracy. These measurements correspond to comparable literature values. The boundary conditions of feeding velocity for processing a specific material and nozzle are determined. In this way, requirements such as the fastest or a uniform extrusion can be specifically served by varying the corresponding parameters. An evaluation of the effects in the nozzles results in a nozzle performance overview. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - A concentric cylindrical cloak is showed here to achieve the acoustic cloaking phenomenon. The introduced structure consists of MNE layers and water in MNE substrate in the MHz frequency range. Due to avoiding the incoming acoustic waves by the shell, the object can be hidden inside the cylindrical area of any shape. In order to improve the quality of cloaking, we have optimized the desired shell by considering the manufacturing technology. We show that an optimized, acoustic cloak based on composite lattice structure can reduce the scattering of an object more than a 20-layer realization of acoustic cloak based on multilayer cylindrical structure. This design approach can substantially simplify the fabrication of cloaking shells. In this research, to study the acoustic distribution of the desired structure, finite element method (FEM) has been used to analyze the structure in two dimensions and a cloak of natural materials with isotropic properties has been designed using effective medium theory. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In Middlemarch, George Eliot famously warns readers not to see themselves as the centre of their own world, which produces a 'flattering illusion of concentric arrangement'. The scholarly contributors to Antipodean George Eliot resist this form of centrism. Hailing from four continents and six countries, they consider Eliot from a variety of de-centred vantage points, exploring how the obscure and marginal in Eliot's life and work sheds surprising light on the central and familiar. With essays that span the full range of Eliot's career-from her early journalism, to her major novels, to eccentric late works such as Impressions of Theophrastus Such-Antipodean George Eliot is committed to challenging orthodoxies about Eliot's development as a writer, overturning received ideas about her moral and political thought, and unveiling new contexts for appreciating her unparalleled significance in nineteenth-century letters. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Margaret Harris and Matthew Sussman.

AB  - The soft-core long range interactions realized in Bose gases by Rydberg dressing technology open up a new avenues for quantum-state manipulation, especially to generate the supersolid and chiral supersolid. We investigate the ground-state of a two-component spin–orbit-coupled Bose–Einstein condensates with unequal intra-species interactions and soft-core long range interactions confined in concentrically coupled annular traps. Our results show that for the equal soft-core long range interactions and unequal hard-core short range intra-species interactions, the ground-state exhibits three types of chiral supersolid, which are the three vortices, vortex pair and single vortex in each unit cell, respectively. For the unequal intra-species interactions and unequal soft-core long range interaction, the strong unequal intra-species interactions can give rise to two new types of chiral supersolid with single vortex or vortex pair in each unit cell. Our study provides a new potential approach to obtain chiral supersolid in a two-component spin–orbit-coupled Bose–Einstein condensates. © 2022 The Physical Society of Japan.

AB  - When constraints on antipredator coloration shift over the course of development, it can be advantageous for animals to adopt different color strategies for each life stage. Many caterpillars in the genus Papilio exhibit unique ontogenetic color sequences: for example, early instars that masquerade as bird feces, with later instars possessing eyespots. I hypothesize that larvae abandon feces masquerade in favor of eyespots due to ontogenetic changes in signaler size. This ontogenetic pattern also occurs within broader seasonal shifts in background color and predator activity. I conducted predation experiments with artificial prey to determine how potential signaling constraints (specifically size and season) shape predation risk, and consequently the expression of ontogenetic color change in Papilio larvae. Seasonally, both predation and background greenness declined significantly from July to September, though there was little evidence that these patterns impacted the effectiveness of either color strategy. Caterpillar size and color strongly affected the attack rate of avian predators: attacks increased with prey size regardless of color, and eyespotted prey were attacked more than masquerading prey overall. These results may reflect a key size-mediated tradeoff between conspicuousness and intimidation in eyespotted prey, and raise questions about how interwoven aspects of behavior and signal environment might maintain the prevalence of large, eyespotted larvae in nature. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper discusses a low-cost, computer vision based approach to indirectly estimate on-chuck substrate (wafer) placement errors for photoresist spin coating processes in a semiconductor manufacturing environment. Placement errors are estimated by calculating the relative displacement vector between circles bounding the wafer and the photoresist region post edge bead removal (EBR) processing. On-chuck wafer placement is critical in maintaining concentric EBR performances and without a method of detection it is challenging to contain mechanical tool failures, incorrectly performed preventive maintenance (PM) or other human errors. The study revisits the Hough transform (HT) for circle detections from accuracy and computational viewpoints using synthetically generated images. The detection accuracy of HT is proven outstanding. However, processing times dramatically increase (hours) in case of high resolution, real wafer images despite adequate preprocessing. This drawback is compensated by processing only subsets of images relying on mechanical wafer position controls during the wafer scan although, this potentially undermines the overall accuracy of this classical approach.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a fast single-cut near-field to far-field transformation method using amplitude-only data. By measuring the antenna near-field amplitude on two concentric rings, the complex far-field for the corresponding ring plane can be retrieved. This avoids the full spherical scanning of traditional near-field measurements if one is interested in only a few radiation pattern cuts. In addition, the phase retrieval algorithm benefits from the reduced dimensionality of the problem. Because the number of unknowns have been reduced to a single ring, the performance is improved with respect to standard full spherical phaseless approaches. The proposed single-cut phaseless technique is tested using simulated and measured data, showing its potential for fast and more reliable amplitude-only measurements.  © 2022 European Association for Antennas and Propagation.

AB  - Mining is present in all major biomes worldwide and overlaps strongly with areas of importance for bird conservation. Mining causes multiple types of environmental disturbance, including habitat alteration, increased human presence and persistent heavy metal pollution. Feather coloration and fluctuating asymmetry (random deviation from perfect symmetry between the two sides of the body), especially of elaborate or ornamental characters, have been proposed as potentially useful biomarkers of anthropogenic stress in birds. However, there has been virtually no research on their responses to mining disturbance. Here, we use colour and morphometric measurements and collection location data from museum specimens of the Russet-crowned Motmot Momotus mexicanus to evaluate how their proximity to mining concessions in south-central Mexico (Morelos, Guerrero and Oaxaca states) relates to: (1) structural and melanin-based plumage coloration, and (2) size and fluctuating asymmetry of their distinctive racket-shaped tail. As a resident, philopatric bird that has been observed nesting directly in contaminated mining waste, motmots may be particularly well suited for addressing this question. In birds collected closer to metal mines, the violet under-eye spot had decreased UV-blue chroma and the black eye streak was paler, and there was weaker colour contrast between these adjacent conspicuous facial plumage patches. Body, tail and crown colour and tail length and asymmetry were unaffected by metal mine distance, and no variable was affected by distance to mines extracting non-metals. Overall, our findings show that aspects of motmot coloration are affected by mining disturbance, probably more from heavy metal contamination rather than other aspects of mine-related anthropization. Further research is needed to determine whether these effects are due to direct toxicity or to ecological effects such as decreased food availability and to discern whether altered colour of conspicuous patches affects social processes such as mate choice and territorial interactions in populations exposed to mining. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe role of perichondrium in cartilage graft survival has been long debated. Although the innate function of perichondrium in providing mechanical and regenerative support to cartilage in its native position is relatively undisputed, studies continue to vacillate over how the perichondrium effects cartilage grafts once transplanted. This review evaluates historical and recent experiments showing how perichondrium may or may not impact graft survival.Recent findingsExperimental studies in animal models have more recently evaluated macroscopic and microscopic properties of diced cartilage grafts with and without perichondrium, finding that in general grafted cartilage with perichondrial components retains greater weight and mechanical strength compared with cartilage without perichondrial components. However, these findings have not been replicated in humans. Solid pieces of rib cartilage have most recently been used without perichondrium to prevent warping, though no studies have evaluated whether retaining perichondrium with oblique and concentric cutting techniques may effect overall resorption.SummaryAlthough historical opinions and more recent animal studies suggest a role of perichondrium in cartilage graft survival, randomized controlled human studies are still lacking on whether retaining perichondrium truly effects graft survival and ultimate surgical outcomes. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The present work determines numerical solutions applied to flow problems in a cut-cell framework, introducing and evaluating two interpolation alternatives for the treatment of the convective terms and the effect of the variation of the number of slave cells generated near the solid interfaces. Using the upwind, QUICK and WAHYD (TVD) schemes, three benchmark cases were studied in the laminar regime, namely, flow between concentric cylindrical walls, flow in an inclined channel and flow around a cylinder. The numerical results obtained were favorable for the proposed interpolation methodology that prevents velocity over/under-estimations on the finite control volume faces, observing a tendency to produce smaller errors and mid-to-high computational efficiencies when coupled with a smaller number of slave cells generated at the boundaries. Although the magnitude of the errors found were small, improvements are of more significance for quantities that depend on gradient estimations at surfaces. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Several studies have shown that the application rules of the capacity design principle suggested for chevron braced frames are often not effective in preventing yielding or buckling of the columns of the braced frame. Indeed, the design procedures available in literature or in seismic codes either neglect or significantly underestimate bending moments in columns. These bending moments are negligible when braces are in the elastic range of behaviour, but they may become significant because of concentration of the interstorey displacement demand when the braced frame overcomes its elastic range of behaviour and braces of a few stories experience large inelastic deformations. The high values of bending moments undermine the seismic performance of concentrically braced frames if yielding or buckling of the columns occurs prior to the full exploitation of the ductility capacity of braces. A simple procedure has been recently proposed by the authors to estimate the bending moments in columns of braced frames at the achievement of the ductility capacity of braces. In this paper, the abovementioned procedure is applied to predict bending moments in columns of concentrically braced frames in the chevron configuration designed according to different design procedures available in literature. To assess the effectiveness of the procedure, the predicted values of bending moments are compared to those obtained by nonlinear dynamic analyses with reference to peak ground accelerations leading the structure to either significant damage or near collapse limit state. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We study the problem of motion planning for a collection of n labeled unit disc robots in a polygonal environment. We assume that the robots have revolving areas around their start and final positions: that each start and each final is contained in a radius 2 disc lying in the free space, not necessarily concentric with the start or final position, which is free from other start or final positions. This assumption allows a weakly-monotone motion plan, in which robots move according to an ordering as follows: during the turn of a robot R in the ordering, it moves fully from its start to final position, while other robots do not leave their revolving areas. As R passes through a revolving area, a robot R′ that is inside this area may move within the revolving area to avoid a collision. Notwithstanding the existence of a motion plan, we show that minimizing the total traveled distance in this setting, specifically even when the motion plan is restricted to be weakly-monotone, is APX-hard, ruling out any polynomial-time (1+ε)-approximation algorithm. On the positive side, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for computing a feasible weakly-monotone motion plan. The total distance traveled by the robots is within an O(1) factor of that of the optimal motion plan, which need not be weakly monotone. Our algorithm extends to an online setting in which the polygonal environment is fixed but the initial and final positions of robots are specified in an online manner. Finally, we observe that the overhead in the overall cost that we add while editing the paths to avoid robot-robot collision can vary significantly depending on the ordering we chose. Finding the best ordering in this respect is known to be NP-hard, and we provide a polynomial time O(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n)-approximation algorithm for this problem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To better understand water inrushes originating from shaft-freezing holes, the hydrogeological conditions and water source were analyzed for a typical inrush case in the Yingpanhao coal mine in western China. The mechanism of this new type of water inrush was identified by considering the stratum movement caused by mining, the concentric annular channels of freezing holes, and the dynamic recharge of multiple aquifers. A new risk assessment model and corresponding grouting method were developed and the problems involving the prediction of water inrush and selection of the optimum grouting position were described. Detailed guidelines for grouting, including the layout of injection boreholes, slurries, grouting pressure and stopping criteria, were proposed. A grouting case targeting this type of water inrush in the Yingpanhao coal mine was introduced. Field studies indicated that open, concentric annular freezing hole channels provide favorable conditions for groundwater migration. The proposed method may effectively inhibit groundwater migration in multiple aquifers and prevent water inrushes through shaft freezing holes and provides an appropriate framework for water inrush prevention for similar mining areas in western China. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity in urbanized landscapes is the top most conservation priority. Urban development results in an increase in local extinction rates and eliminates the majority of native species. The pattern of rainfall is changing and frequency of extreme events increasing due to urbanization and rapidly increasing average global temperature. These changes are having observable impacts on biodiversity at species level and ecosystem level, in terms of distribution, composition and function. Mardan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has different habitats; it represents a useful ecological model to identify the effect of habitat heterogeneity on bird communities. We conducted the study to explore the local avian fauna and to compare its composition and diversity in different habitats. Bird species were identified employing point counts method in urban area; agricultural area with small forest chunk and water body. Twenty four point counts were plotted in three well-defined locations such that each location was divided into eight concentric rings of 10 m radius from 0-50 m with an onward interval of 50 m. Thirty five avian species belonging to 23 families and 10 orders were recorded. However, One Way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) indicated significant (P < 0.05) differences in distribution of avian species among habitats. Results suggest that urban area fails to maintain high bird diversity than the adjacent agricultural area. The agricultural area showed the lowest proportion of exclusive species compared to urban area and water body, even though the heterogeneous aspects of the area favor local species richness.

AB  - The concentric cable-driven manipulator is becoming increasingly important in minimally invasive surgery. Obviously, one of the basic requirements is to track trajectory and avoid collision at the same time. However, the unavoidable difficulty is to choose an inverse kinematics solution that fits inside the confined environment from infinitely many solutions due to its redundancy. This article proposes a combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bézier curve for the concentric cable-driven manipulator tracking desired trajectory in confined 2-D and 3-D. First, the new proposed structure and the nomenclature are introduced. Then, the kinematic modeling of the concentric cable-driven manipulator in actuator space, configuration space, and task space is detailed. Thereafter, using the proposed biarc curve, the relationship between the end direction and bending angles is comprehensively analyzed. The Bézier curve is then adopted to plan the desired path for the concentric cable-driven manipulator moving in confined 2-D and 3-D environments. Finally, the proposed combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bézier curve is experimentally verified in a trajectory tracking task simulating a large intestine examination in both the typical 'C' configuration (2-D environment) and the 'S' configuration (3-D environment). The results prove that the combined planning method based on biarc curve and Bézier curve can be applied to generate a reasonable solution for concentric cable-driven manipulators that are confined both 2-D and 3-D environments.  © 1996-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This study analyzes the extent to which alarm systems impact geographical displacement and/or diffusion of benefits on burglary, which regards as a substitute for the absence of capable guardians. A quasi-experimental design with three nested concentric zones—target, buffer, and control—are utilized by incorporating the WDQ conceptual approach with GIS and a parcel map. The datasets include burglary incidents and alarm permit records. Alarms produce a sizeable impact on burglary reduction. No indication of spatial displacement is observed from protected houses to nearby houses. Alarms create a short geographic ambit and a wider spatial range of diffusion of benefits. A burglar alarm can protect the house without displacing burglary to nearby houses and provides neighboring houses with protection as well. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This paper studied the incident of linear oblique waves to circular columns of offshore wind turbines in conjunction with concentric and non-concentric thin permeable cylinders. The unique research objective of this work is to assess the possibility of using permeable vertical cylinders to reduce wave forces on the column of offshore wind turbines. The developed semi-analytical method benefits from the mathematical relation between Bessel functions to express the BEM-related integrals in the Fourier modes of the Hankel function and to calculate singular integrals indirectly. Moreover, Graf's addition theorem for Bessel functions was used for shifting between different coordinate systems to avoid calculating related integrals numerically. The basic geometries parameters such as permeability parameter, cylinders arrangement and the radius of the permeable cylinders, and the wavenumber on the horizontal wave-induced force were studied. The results are presented in graphs. The results indicate that covering the columns of DeepCwind and OC3 wind turbines with the permeable cylinders or using the permeable cylinders upstream helps reduce the horizontal wave-induced force at a particular permeability parameter. The results of this research are beneficial in the design of columns of offshore wind turbines and other structures with vertical piles, such as semi-submersibles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Multidimensional numerical simulations are performed to investigate the evolution and formation of unburned fuels for a shock–fuel jet interaction scenario. A full set of Navier–Stokes equations with detailed chemical mechanisms are solved, and the results are analyzed through the Lagrangian method with the goal of improving combustion efficiency in supersonic flows. The flame morphology of a two-dimensional (2-D) non-premixed reactive shock–bubble interaction is first simulated and studied, in which unburned hydrogen is found to prevent efficient combustion. By applying the Lagrangian particle tracking method, most of the unburned hydrogen wrapped into the primary vortex turns out to be initially located upon the symmetry line of the bubble. Motivated by the idea of breaking the primary vortex, this study designs a novel geometry of a concentric bubble, which improves combustion efficiency to 94.4% in contrast to a solid fuel bubble (74%) due to multivortex interaction and a thick bridge structure. With the consistency between qualitative and quantitative 2-D and three-dimensional (3-D) flow dynamics, the idea of a 2-D concentric-bubble configuration is effectively extended to a 3-D coaxial jet interacting with oblique shock despite the existence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. © 2021 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

AB  - This paper gives, in the limit of large Froude number, a closed-form, analytical solution for steady, two-dimensional, inviscid, free-surface attached flow over a submerged planar hydrofoil for arbitrary angles of attack and depths of submergence. The doubly connected flow domain is conformally mapped to a concentric annulus in an auxiliary plane. The complex flow potential and its derivative, the complex velocity, are obtained in the auxiliary plane by considering their form at known special points in the flow, and the required conformal mapping is determined by explicit integration. The four real solution parameters are determined as the simultaneous roots of four real nonlinear algebraic equations arising from the flow normalisation. The explicit form allows accurate evaluation of various flow quantities, including the lift on the foil, and these are related to the large-Froude-number results in recent numerical solutions. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Concentric tube robots are highly flexible and easy to enter body through natural orifices or small incisions. Therefore, they have great application prospects in the field of minimally invasive surgery. At present, concentric tube robots are usually remotely operated master-slave devices, which are flexible but large and heavy. In this paper, a handheld con-centric tube robot is proposed for nasal cyst drainage surgery. Roller gears are used to make the transmission mechanism more compact for handheld. The introduction of the ball gear mechanism and the ergonomic design of the structure allow the surgeons to use the device more easily and comfortably during surgical tasks. The ball gear mechanism allows the Nitinol tube to be bent from the base, thus greatly extending the workspace of the end-effector. The rotation of the ball joint relieves the user of uncomfortable bending of the wrist and arm to keep the Nitinol tube pointed in a specific position, thus avoiding musculoskeletal pain or injury from long-term use. Ergonomics-based design makes the device more humane and conducive to promotion and use in surgeries. In addition, an intuitive operation pattern is proposed to steer the end-effector position in real time. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The local impact resistance of honeycomb sandwich panels with curved and flat geometries differs due to the global stress state. In this study, curved sandwich panels with coaxial and concentric honeycombs are designed and their resistance is investigated against local impact. The numerical model is calibrated with the air cannon test results and then used to compare the performance of structures that are sandwiched by different honeycombs. The comparable study shows that the impact resistance of flat sandwich structures outperforms that of curved ones at a low impact velocity, and a small radius of curvature should be avoided when considering an enhancement of the impact resistance by curvature design. In addition, under the high-velocity impact, sandwich panels with concentric honeycombs show an improved impact resistance as compared to those with coaxial honeycombs. However, the influence of honeycomb configurations on the impact resistance is reduced as the radius of curvature increases. Using the equivalent analysis, the equivalent face sheet thickness and equivalent impact velocity of curved sandwich structures with different radii of curvature, which are compared to the flat structures that are subjected to typical impact loads, are achieved. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how attitudes toward different nonhuman animal species (including emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and harm avoidance) are shaped by the coevolutionary histories between the ancestors of contemporary humans and these different nonhuman animal species. We compared the explanatory power of alternative categorization frameworks for classifying attitudes toward animals across several cross-cultural samples (Arizona, California, Costa Rica, Spain, and Mexico). Analytical Approach 1 directly compared two alternative frameworks. Adapa categories were generated as purely functional ones based upon the ecological niches occupied by each species within the biotic community generated by human–nonhuman animal relations, and Tuxtla categories were generated as cognitive ones based upon the degrees of consciousness commonly ascribed to the constituent species. Analytical Approach 2 tested the alternative hypothesis that both categories were part of a general scheme organized into three superordinate categories reflecting concentric circles around our own, consistent with fitness interdependence theory. Results supported this alternative hypothesis. The concentric circles model (Kith & Kin Animals, Domesticated Animals, and Wild Animals) better explained empathy and harm avoidance scores, suggesting that attitudes toward specific animal species are partly shaped by which circles they fall into, the product of the coevolutionary relationship shared between them and humans. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine whether the nonhuman animal affinities described by the proposed psychometric construct of Animality might be distributed unequally across different kinds of animals. Thus, we explored how respondent Animality scores correlated with clade-specific self-reports of cognitive and emotional empathy toward specific animal categories. To do so, we applied the Concentric Circles Model, three concentric circles of nonhuman animal clades based on their figurative outwards distance from humanity: Kith and Kin Animals, including kith clades such as dogs and cats as well as kin clades such as primates; Domestic Animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, and goats; and Wild Animals, including catfish, carp, snakes, and spiders. Undergraduate participants from a Southwestern university completed a survey assessing their levels of Animality as well as their attitudes toward nonhuman animals from all three concentric circles. These data replicated the previously published hierarchical latent structure of Animality. The higher-order General Factor of Animality (GFA) loaded positively onto two lower-order factors: Attraction to Animals and Emotional Regard for Animals. The GFA was most highly positively correlated with Kith and Kin Animal Cognitive-Emotional Empathy, less highly correlated with Domestic Cognitive-Emotional Empathy, and least highly correlated with Wild Cognitive-Emotional Empathy; the GFA was also positively correlated with General Animal Harm Avoidance. In this sense, Animality seems to capture significant aspects of Clade-Specific Biophila in a manner consistent with the Concentric Circles Model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Aim: Sufficient strength and dynamic stability of the lower limbs are essential for improving punching force and preventing injury in amateur boxers. However, there are still no comprehensive reports on the isokinetic knee strength of boxers with different performance levels. The current study aimed to profile the isokinetic muscle strength of flexion and extension of the knee in boxers, as well as bilateral, unilateral, and functional ratios, and investigate the variation in these muscle strength characteristics associated with different performance levels. Methods: Boxers were divided in two performance groups, elite (five males and four females) and non-elite groups (five males and four females). Muscle strength of the knee was determined via an IsoMed2000 device. Parameters examined included peak torque of the hamstring (H) and quadriceps (Q) during concentric (con) and eccentric (ecc) contractions at low (60°/S), medium (180°/S), and high (240°/S) speed and bilateral ratios (BLs), unilateral ratios (ULs), and functional ratios of dominant (D) and non-dominant limbs. Results: In all angular velocities, the peak torque of H and Q was stronger in the elite group than in the non-elite group. ULs were lower in the elite group than in the non-elite group in Hcon/Qcon at 180D (p < 0.01) and 180ND (p < 0.05) and in Hecc/Qecc at 60D, 180D (p < 0.05) and 240D (p < 0.01). The elite group had higher BLs than the non-elite group in Hcon at 60°/S (p < 0.05) and Qcon at 180°/S (p < 0.05). The non-elite group had a higher functional ratio than elite boxers in Hecc/Qcon at 180D and 240D (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Elite boxers had stronger knee strength in con and ecc contractions. All boxers had normal Hecc/Qecc and Hcon/Qecc. Hcon/Qcon and Hecc/Qcon were abnormal at lower angular velocity. Elite boxers had higher BLs and lower ULs, indicating that they are at a higher risk of injury. Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Chen, Chen, Yi, Cui, Wu and Wang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankle sprain is the most common acute time-loss injury in volleyball and occurs mainly during landing from a jump. Therefore, we have evaluated the role of quadriceps strength and countermovement jump height on ankle sprain occurrence, as these intrinsic modifiable risk factors were not yet evaluated. We have also hypothesized that presence of quadriceps strength asymmetry could be a possible risk factor for ankle sprains in male volleyball players. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Male volleyball players (N.=99) from Slovenian national league participated in the study. Before the start of the season, all participants completed a preseason questionnaire and underwent evaluation of vertical jump performance and bilateral isokinetic strength of the quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H). During the subsequent season the players reported acute time loss injuries because of ankle sprain through a weekly questionnaire. RESULTS: We have registered 19 ankle sprains during the season. Overall ankle sprain incidence was 0.41±0.24 per 1000 h. Previous ankle sprain (Odds Ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.25-2.89, P=0.802) and jump height (1.05; 95% CI: 0.94-1.19, P=0.393) were not significant risk factors, while Q strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of an ankle sprain (Odds Ratio: 0.956; 95% CI: 0.919-0.995, P=0.026). Compared with the uninjured players, the injured players had higher right concentric Q strength, higher Q strength asymmetry, and lower concentric right H-Q strength ratio (all P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that excessive concentric strength of the right Q, which leads to low H-Q strength ratio, and high bilateral Q strength asymmetry in favor of the right side, could be associated with increased risk of ankle sprains in male volleyball. © 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

AB  - The pathogenic fungus Cercospora infecting plants causes high degree symptomatic disease in several important crops including tea (Camellia sinensis). Genetic diversity studies on plant pathogens are essential to tackle plant diseases, hence in the proposed study, Cercospora theae isolated from different regions was characterized using the molecular tool like RFLP of the rDNA regions amplified using ITS primers. Protein profiling for all the isolates was also done by optimizing the protein extraction using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), urea and Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) protocols. Genetic relatedness with the identical size of molecular weight among the three C. theae isolates of different regions was studied from the 5.8S rDNA-ITS amplified regions. Digestion of the amplified regions with seven specific endonucleases exposed the same banding pattern among the isolates. The sequence data from the three isolates showed maximum homology with the Genbank sequence of Cercospora spp. (HQ450006, JQ754039, JQ753964, JN942274, JN942272, FJ460222 and EU581822). Further, an optimized protocol for protein profiling of C. theae was determined to extract the majority of the proteins. The results also revealed that the most suitable protocol for studying the proteomics of C. theae was the SDS extraction method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Embryos of the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst), were cryopreserved after modification to the method that was previously described for Pectinophora gossipiella. The workflow to develop the protocol consisted of methods to weaken the embryonic chorion followed by the application of various methods to disrupt the sub-chorionic wax layer. These steps were necessary to render the embryos permeable to water and cryoprotectants. Initially, the embryos were incubated at 21° and 24 °C, and the development of the double pigment spots/eyespot and eclosion were tracked every two hours. The embryos at 24 °C showed eyespots as early as 30 h, while in the case of the embryos that were incubated at 21 °C, there was a developmental delay of approximately 20 h. The embryos at 24 °C showed peak eclosion between 55 and 70 h, and the embryos at 21 °C eclosed between 80 and 100 h of development. Estimating this range is crucial for the purposes of stage selection and treatment initiation for cryopreservation protocol development for the embryos. The control hatch percentage at either developmental temperature was >90%, and the sodium hypochloride, 2-propanol and alkane-based treatments reduced the embryo hatchability to <10%. Hence, a modified surfactant—hypochlorite mixture—was used to destabilize the chorion and solubilize the hydrophobic lipid layers. Water permeability assessments using the dye-uptake method show that polysorbate 80 in combination with sodium hypochlorite alone is capable of permeabilizing the embryo as efficiently as sequential hypochlorite—alkane treatments, but with significantly higher hatch rates. A vitrification medium consisting of ethane diol and trehalose was used to dehydrate and load the embryos with the cryoprotective agent. The median hatch rates after vitrification were 10%, and maximum was 23%. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Helical fibers represent of one of the most extraordinary objects in living organisms and have recently produced through a coaxial microfluidic spinning process. But the requirement of collection capillaries may limit scalable production because of blockage liability, structural rigidity and cumbersome fabrication of capillary. Structural vulnerability of helical fibers could also limit their practical applications, e.g., in fabric and as wearable devices. Herein for the first time we showed that helical fibers could be produced solely with a core steel needle with double concentric sleeves through a coaxial wet spinning process, without the requirement of microfluidic spinning capillary. They were encapsulated into protection microtubes in an unprecedented form of rifled microtubes with helical ribs. The presence of protection microtubes promote not only their mechanical properties, but also structural endurance to various practical circumstances. These rifled microtubes could serve as endurable and sensitive wearable strain/stress sensors (up to ∼300% strain and ∼100 kPa stress) to monitor various human motions, without showing conspicuous performance decay even after >104 cycles of measurements. This study offers not only a facile and scalable pathway of producing helical fibers, but also an unprecedented platform of rifled microtubes as endurable and sensible sensors of strain and pressure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article presents the results of an echocardiographic study of 64 male playing sports athletes (basketball and football). The results of the study showed that up to the age of 19 in playing sports athletes, only normal geometry of the left ventricle is observed. With age and, accordingly, with an increase in the experience of playing sports, the number of eccentric and concentric remodeling and eccentric and concentric myocardial hypertrophy increases statistically. The percentage of concentric myocardial hypertrophy (pathological remodeling) was 6.5 %, 12.5 % and 7.7 % in the groups 19-25 years old, 26-30 years old and 31 and older, respectively, which must be taken into account when taking measures to prevent overtraining and sudden cardiac death in sports. © 2022 Editorial Office of Journal of Ceramics.

AB  - Lunar floor-fractured craters are characterized by the occurrence of radial and concentric grabens, and while their formation mechanism was broadly studied in literature, the relationships between displacement and length of the faults, together with the fault growth, were never examined. We produced a semiautomated Python-based script able to analyze all the parameters required for this study: displacement, length, width of the grabens, and power law relationship between displacement and length. The results of our investigation, carried on in Komarov, Humboldt, and Atlas craters, showed a sublinear fault growth, suggesting that for some reason the increase in displacement is not linear with respect to length. This can result from the interplay of mechanical discontinuities related to the stratigraphy (which cause a vertical fault restriction, preventing the displacement from developing in depth), and to linkage phenomena. The Dmax/L ratios that resulted from our analyses are higher than previously predicted for the Moon and appear more similar to the values observed on Earth. The slip distribution revealed different stages of fault interaction within the same crater, while the overall maturity of the grabens seems to be significantly high based on the observed symmetry of the grabens. Moreover, our code (public and accessible) can facilitate future works that aim to widen our knowledge about the lunar faults' growth, with all the implications that can improve our understanding of the faults' behavior. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The accuracy of camera calibration depends significantly on the control point detection which customarily subjects to image noise, distortion and resolution. This paper uses concentric circle grids as the calibration pattern and accordingly proposes a robust and accurate control point detection method for camera calibration. Each set of concentric circles on the grids pattern consists of multiple circles whose radii decrease progressively. The geometric structure of multi-hierarchies can not only robustly extract control points from complicated scenarios but also build a voting scheme to avoid numerical instability resulting from the estimation of projected centers. According to the common self-polar triangle of concentric circles and the local sub-pixel edge detection algorithm, we efficiently estimated sub-pixel coordinates of control points under projective transformation. Simulations and real experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the performance of calibration using concentric circle grids is superior to the popular grid patterns with respect to the image noise, distortion and resolution. © 2020

AB  - The Jack Rabbit II (JR II) field experiments involved a series of trials in 2015 and 2016, each with 5–20 tons of pressurized liquefied chlorine released. All five trials in 2015 had vertically downward releases. The four trials in 2016 involved different release orientations. Roughly 200 chlorine sensors of four types (Jaz, Canary, MiniRAE, and ToxiRAE) were on the test grid at fixed locations during each trial, placed along 90 deg concentric arcs from 0.2 to 11 km from the source. These sensors use different technologies and have different detection ranges. All sensors were carefully calibrated, but pre- and post-trial challenge test results show that the MiniRAE sensors tended to drift. We applied special corrections to the MiniRAE data to correct for the drift. The roughly 19 million concentration records were further quality-assured and condensed to summary tables that include the maximum concentrations. This condensed data set was used in the model evaluation study described in the current special issue. Preliminary analyses suggest that, despite the necessary corrections to the MiniRAE data and the saturation of some sensors, the JR II concentration data in general are of good quality. For example, collocated sensors show good agreement, the arc-maximum normalized concentrations with downwind distance follow the −5/3 power law, and the limited sensor vertical profile data show that cloud heights increase with downwind distance. Future field campaigns of similar scale should carefully examine experimental setup and the latest detection technologies to avoid instrument saturation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anchor systems are widely used to stabilize soil slope and suppress slope failure. Thus, monitoring conditions of an anchor system is important to prevent disasters due to slope failure. The slope condition can be indirectly monitored by sensing the tensile force applied to the anchor because the slope deformation directly affects the anchor force. Previously, we propose a way to monitor the tensile force of the anchor by measuring the strain field on a bearing plate using a distributed fiber optic sensor (OFDR) and experimentally demonstrate that the anchor force has a large correlation with the strain distribution on the bearing plate. However, it was found that a spatial variation of the strain and thermal strain due to temperature change makes it difficult to get a reliable correlation coefficient. In this study, we newly propose a way to get a reliable correlation coefficient between the anchor force and the strain field on the bearing plate. We install a distributed optical fiber sensor in two concentric circles on the bearing plate and measure circumferential strain distribution. We take average values of the strain field in each circle as representative strain values minimizing the spatial variation and takes a difference of the two strains to exclude the temperature effect. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method gives a reliable correlation coefficient between the anchor force and the strain field on the bearing plate. This technique can be applied to various anchor systems to monitor the anchor force and manage the anchor systems safely. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Disease detection in the crops is a difficult work as crops get affected due to various attacks from different bacteria, fungi and viruses. The disease symptoms on the infected crop plant can be seen as usually color change, circular spots, specks and hollow areas having concentric rings. This paper proposes a solution for identification of crop diseases (i.e., bacterial and fungal diseases) in tomato cash crop of Himachal Pradesh. Detecting the disease at an early stage enables the farmers to act and treat the plants at the appropriate time and effectively. Accurate and timely detection of plant diseases can help mitigate the agriculture loss experienced by the local farmers. An initial evaluation system and statistical analysis proposed in this work show a positive impact. The dataset has been created by the authors by collecting real-time pictures from various fields of Himachal Pradesh state which contains images with different diseases for tomato plant. The proposed approach provides efficient result that can lead to connection between farmers and agriculturists. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Anurans show a wide variety of anti-predator mechanisms, and the species of the Neotropical clade Leiuperinae display several of them. Most species of Edalorhina, Physalaemus and Pleurodema show eyespots, hidden bright colours, macroglands in a inguinal/lumbar position, defensive behaviours and/or chemical defence. We conducted a histological analysis of dorsal and lumbar skin and revised the colour patterns, defensive behaviours and glandular secretions to study the diversity and evolution of anti-predator mechanisms associated with macroglands. We describe 17 characters and optimize these in a phylogenetic hypothesis of Leiuperinae. In the most recent common ancestor of Edalorhina + Engystomops + Physalaemus + Pleurodema, a particular type of serous gland (the main component of macroglands) evolved in the lumbar skin, along with the absence of the Eberth-Katschenko layer. A defensive behaviour observed in leiuperines with macroglands includes four displays ('crouching down' behaviour, rear elevation, body inflation and eye protection), all present in the same ancestor. The two elements associated with aposematism (hidden bright colours and eyespots) evolved independently in several species. Our results provide phylogenetic evidence for the startle-first hypothesis, which suggests that behavioural displays arise as sudden movements in camouflaged individuals to avoid predatory attacks, before the origin of bright coloration. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - Introduction: Elite youth soccer players suffer increasing numbers of injuries owing to constantly increasing physical demands. Deficits in neuromuscular performance may increase the risk of injury. Injury risk factors need to be identified and practical cut-off scores defined. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess neuromuscular performance parameters within a laboratory-based injury risk screening, to investigate their association with the risk of non-contact lower extremity injuries in elite youth soccer players, and to provide practice-relevant cut-off scores. Methods: Sixty-two elite youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years) performed unilateral postural control exercises in different conditions, isokinetic tests of concentric and eccentric knee extension and knee flexion (60°/s), isometric tests of hip adduction and abduction, and isometric tests of trunk flexion, extension, lateral flexion and transversal rotation during the preseason period. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. Risk profiling was assessed using a multivariate approach utilizing a Decision Tree model [Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method]. Results: Twenty-five non-contact injuries were registered. The Decision Tree model selected the COP sway, the peak torque for knee flexion concentric, the functional knee ratio and the path of the platform in that hierarchical order as important neuromuscular performance parameters to discriminate between injured and non-injured players. The classification showed a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.91. The relative risk was calculated at 4.2, meaning that the risk of suffering an injury is four times greater for a player, who has been classified as injured by the Decision Tree model. Conclusion: Measuring static postural control, postural control under unstable condition and the strength of the thigh seem to enable a good indication of injury risk in elite youth soccer players. However, this finding has to be taken with caution due to a small number of injury cases. Nonetheless, these preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and in planning and developing customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors in elite youth soccer players.

AB  - In general, butterfly ventral hind wing eyespots are considered to play a role in predator-prey interactions. These eyespots are prominent wing pattern elements in Brassolini butterflies, and they vary in size, position, and number across taxa. Female Caligo Hübner, 1819 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) appear to use the large eyespots of lekking males as a mate-locating cue, but female Opsiphanes Doubleday, 1849 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) do not because males patrol to find mates. These behaviors led us to predict that male Caligo should have larger eyespots than females, but eyespot size would not differ between sexes in Opsiphanes. Our analyses supported these predictions. As displacement of the eyespots to the center of the wing might make them more conspicuous, we asked if eyespot position and size covaried across the Brassolini phylogeny. While we found a positive association between position and size, the relationship of these two variables contained significant phylogenetic signal. Two Brassolini species show strong sexual dimorphism where females converge on the color pattern of sympatric species of Caligo. Their ventral hind wing eyespots are much larger than those of close relatives, approximating those of Caligo, and further reinforcing the importance of ventral hind wing eyespots as a visual signal in this group of butterflies. Importantly, our results suggest that, in addition to antipredation defense, ventral hind wing eyespots can function in mating activities, and consequently they might be evolving under both natural and sexual selection in Caligo butterflies.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Two spatiotemporally distant deposits in western North America on differing sides of the K-Pg boundary are recognized to have accumulated innumerable ferruginous faecal-like specimens consisting of 3-D casts suspended in kaolin clay fills of lacustrine and riparian areas proximal to fluvial channels. Evidence presented interprets these specimens as organic in origin, consisting of coprolites and other bromalites (cololites), at the Readlyn deposit of the Whitemud Formation (Maastrichtian) in southern Saskatchewan and the Salmon Creek deposit of the Wilkes Formation (Miocene) near Toledo, Washington State. Comparable taphonomic processes at each deposit are suggested by preservation of identical, metre-long, enigmatic casts of the digestive system (cololites) of an unknown animal associated with the innumerable coprolites. Micro-fabrics of specimen interiors suggest that microbial mats entombed faecal and other organic entities in kaolin-rich lacustrine muds. This research proposes that microbial-induced ferrihydrite precipitation rapidly transformed into thin encrustations of goethite, encasing faecal droppings and other organic remains. Ferrihydrite-goethite-hematite biomineral sequencing cemented kaolin and quartz silt grains at the interface with the organic remains, precluding significant decay and thereby preserving external surface morphologies as encrustations. The mm-thick layers of the cemented sediment enveloped the organic droppings as rigid goethite moulds, preventing the collapse of the encasement morphologies as the organic residues were replaced by biominerals. Concentric growth layers of microbial mat-induced ferrihydrite-goethite cement progressed inward, resulting in 3-D casts. Only external morphologies were preserved, but often with finely detailed surface textures. The interiors of the casts preserve evidence of interconnected fabrics of pseudomorphed bacterial cell walls consisting of radially arranged jackets of acicular (Readlyn deposit) or platy (Salmon Creek deposit) goethite crystallites. Concretionary siderite replacement fabrics in some specimens resulted in the obliteration of the earlier microbial induced biomineral fabrics. Previous interpretations that the Wilkes Formation specimens resulted from inorganic processes only, thereby pseudo-coprolites, have been reappraised as faecal droppings comparable to coprolites of the Whitemud Formation. © 2021 Lethaia Foundation.

AB  - Elite judo athletes undergo vigorous training to achieve outstanding results. In pursuit of achieving competitive success, the occurrence of injuries amongst judo athletes is not rare. The study aimed to perform a knee flexors and extensors isokinetic torque analysis in elite female judo athletes. Fifty‐eight elite female judo athletes of the Serbian national team (21.02 ± 3.11 years; 62.36 ± 11.91 kg, 165.04 ± 10.24 cm, training experience 12.72 ± 2.98 years) volunteered to participate in this study. The range of motion (ROM) was set at 90⁰. Testing was performed in a concentric–concentric mode for the testing speed of 60 ⁰/s. Five maximal voluntary contractions of knee extensors and knee flexors muscle groups were measured for both legs. The obtained data showed a statistically significant difference in absolute torque values among different categories as heavier athletes demonstrated higher values. Post hoc analysis showed a significant difference between weight categories, as heavier athletes demonstrated higher values, while no significant differences in normalized torque values for different weight categories were observed. The implementation of new elements and training modalities may improve performance and prevent lateral asymmetry, thus reducing the risk of injury. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A finite element model of an aero-engine dual-rotor system with intermediate bearing supported by six bearings is set up. Three modes of non-concentricity caused by the assembly process are defined, namely parallel non-concentricity, front deflection angle non-concentricity and rear deflection angle non-concentricity. The influence of the non-concentricity on the vibration characteristics of the dual-rotor system is investigated in detail. The results show that the parallel non-concentricity and the front deflection angle non-concentricity have a significant influence on the bending vibration modals of the high-pressure rotor and the low-pressure rotor, but have little influence on the local vibration modals of the rotors. With the increase in the magnitude of the non-concentricity, the natural frequencies of the bending modals decrease continuously, and the mode shapes of bending modals and that of local modals may be interchanged, leading to the emergence of bending modals in advance. Therefore, the key parameters to be controlled in the assembly process are the parallel non-concentricity and the front deflection angle non-concentricity. In order to prevent the bending modal of the dual-rotor system from appearing in advance, it is necessary to control the parallel non-concentricity within 2 mm and the front deflection angle non-concentricity amount within 0.18◦ . © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The present study proposes an innovative opto-chemical treatment using a basket-integrated optical device (BIOD) to disinfect mature bacterial biofilm on endoscope channels. A BIOD was designed to position an optical diffuser on the central axis of an endoscope channel and to distribute laser light concentrically to the bacterial biofilm on the channel surface. To apply thermal damage and oxidative stress to the bacterial biofilm, a low concentration of a crosslinking agent (glutaraldehyde ~0.5%) was combined with 808 nm infrared (IR) and 405 nm blue (BL) laser lights. The applied irradiances of IR and BL were 10 W/cm2 and 1.6 W/cm2 for Teflon channel model and 20 W/cm2 and 3.2 W/cm2 for a clinical model, respectively. Individual irradiation of either IR or BL for 180 s induced the maximum temperatures of 62 ± 2 °C and 53 ± 3 °C on the biofilm, respectively. The simultaneous opto-chemical treatment reduced a significant population of the bacterial biofilms (7.5-log10 for Staphylococcus aureus and 7.1-log10 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which were 2.9-fold and 3.9-fold higher than that of the standard treatment with 2% glutaraldehyde (GA) solution, respectively. The proposed opto-chemical disinfection method can help reduce multi-drug resistant bacteria and prevent cross-infection during the clinical usage of a flexible endoscope. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated developmental changes in cold stressed microspores of Indica rice variety At 303. After 3 d at 10°C, approximately 76% of microspores were in the late uni-nucleate stage. Even after 5 d, 49% of viable cells remained in the late uni-nucleate stage without advancing to the bi-nucleate stage. In comparison, microspores undergoing normal gametogenesis in planta progressed rapidly from uni-nucleate to bi-nucleate stage eventually forming tri-nucleate pollen during this period. Thus, cold stress prevented normal microspore development and retained cells in the late uni-nucleate stage which is the most favorable stage for in vitro induction of sporophytic development in rice. Uni-nucleate microspores subjected to cold stress showed a characteristic pattern consisting of several minute vacuoles surrounding a centrally positioned nucleus, which can be interpreted as an early indicator of sporophytic determination in Indica rice microspores. During in vitro culture phase, freshly plated yellow anthers became brown. After 4 wk in culture, 51% of the anthers had discolored. Significantly, all yellow anthers contained only non-viable cells whereas 10% of the brown anthers had few viable cells. Some microspores in brown anthers underwent division on callus induction medium. The first division was symmetrical and occurred after 2 wk. The second division occurred after 4 wk and resulted in four-celled structures. Anther-derived callus was either compact or friable. Histo-differentiation occurred mostly from compact callus. Cell clusters, each delimited by a protoderm, were observed in histological sections of callus grown for 2 to 4 wk on regeneration medium. Within a cellular unit, two heterogeneous cell populations were arranged in concentric rings with larger cells in the center and smaller cells towards the periphery. However, an apical-basal polarity that is present in embryo-like structures was not observed. Therefore, it may be surmised that in Indica rice, regeneration from anther-derived callus takes place not by the formation of somatic embryos but by direct organogenesis. © 2021, The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Most topological insulators (TIs) discovered today in spinful systems can be transformed from topological semimetals (TSMs) with vanishing bulk gap via introducing the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which manifests the intrinsic links between the gapped topological insulator phases and the gapless TSMs. Recently, we have discovered a family of TSMs in time-reversal invariant spinless systems, which host butterfly-like nodal-lines (NLs) consisting of a pair of identical concentric intersecting coplanar ellipses (CICE). In this Communication, we unveil the intrinsic link between this exotic class of nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) and a Z4 = 2 topological crystalline insulator (TCI), by including substantial SOC. We demonstrate that in three space groups (i.e., Pbam (No.55), P4/mbm (No.127), and P42/mbc (No.135)), the TCI supports a fourfold Dirac fermion on the (001) surface protected by two glide symmetries, which originates from the intertwined drumhead surface states of the CICE NLs. The higher order topology is further demonstrated by the emergence of one-dimensional helical hinge states, indicating the discovery of a higher order topological insulator protected by a glide symmetry. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Soccer teams integrate specific exercises into their typical workout programs for injury prevention. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the incorporation of a brief and supplementary training program that involves eccentric, balance, and core exercises into the weekly soccer schedule can cause positive neuromuscular adaptations. Twenty-one soccer players were randomly allocated to either a training (n = 11) or a control group (n = 10). All players followed their teams’ typical program, consisting of 4–5 soccer-specific sessions plus 1 match, weekly. Training group players additionally performed biweekly, hamstring eccentric, balance, and core stability exercises for 8 weeks. Isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque (PT) of the hamstrings and quadriceps, changes in the center of pressure (COP) during a 30 s single-leg stance, and a supine bridge (trunk stability) test were assessed before and after the intervention. After the intervention, a 27% increase in hamstring concentric PT and a 33% reduction in COP sway in the stance test, were observed for the training group only (p < 0.05). These improvements were significant only for the non-dominant leg. Furthermore, the control group displayed an increase in COP sway during the bridge test compared to baseline values (p < 0.05), which reflects a deterioration in postural balance over time. Consequently, incorporating small doses of hamstring eccentric, proprioception, and core stability exercises into a typical training program of youth soccer players improves strength and postural balance in the non-dominant leg, as well as core muscle performance. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - As the feature size keeps shrinking in the modern semiconductor manufacturing process, subresolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion is one promising resolution enhancement technique that can improve the printability and lithographic process window of target patterns. Model-based SRAF generation achieves a high accuracy but with a high computational cost, while rule-based SRAF insertion may require a huge rule table to handle complex patterns. Thus, state-of-the-art works resort to machine learning to reduce runtime but require abundant training samples to generalize the trained models and achieve high performance. Nevertheless, in advanced lithography, we may have a huge solution space of SRAF insertion but few labeled training samples. Therefore, in this work, we address SRAF insertion from a data efficiency perspective. We separate sample selection from SRAF probability learning and train a variational autoencoder and an adversarial network to discriminate between unlabeled and labeled data effectively. Second, we devise a region-based concentric circle area sampling representation to avoid information loss during feature extraction. Third, we determine the final placement of SRAFs by a novel clustering method based on retrieved data points. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art works, by using 40% training samples, our framework can achieve comparable or even better process variation bands and edge placement errors. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Mn- micronodules and nodules of the Clarion-Clipperton zone (Pacific Ocean) are composed of 10 Å and 7 Å phyllomanganates, and δ-MnO2. The Mn-micronodules are built of fine concentric growth layers of three types (1, 2a, and 2b) according to their Mn/Fe ratio and Ni, Cu, and Co content. Applying previously developped geochemical discrimination approaches we found that the Mn-micronodules were diagenetic precipitates that were a result of suboxic diagenesis, whereas the paired Mn-nodules were diagenetic‑hydrogenetic formations. The most common growth layers (type 2) within the Mn-micronodules are suboxic-diagenetic, whereas the rare growth layers (type 1) are mixed diagenetic‑hydrogenetic and hydrogenetic precipitates. The suboxic diagenetic formation of the Mn-micronodules seems to be a result of the fluctuation of the oxic-suboxic front in the sediment since the Last Glacial Period (LGP). The migration of the oxic-suboxic front close to the seawater/sediment boundary during the LGP has likely resulted in suboxic reduction of Mn4+ and other elements in the sediment and their upward diffusion. Post-LGP deepening of the oxic-suboxic front has seemingly led to re-oxidation of Mn2+ in the pore waters and Mn-micronodule precipitation. The suboxic quantitative re-mobilization of seawater-derived Cesolid phase in the sediment (positive Ce anomaly) and its subsequent sequestration by Mn-micronodules resulted in positive Ce anomaly of the Mn-micronodules and Ce-deficient pore water. This Ce deficiency was recorded in the diagenetic Mn-nodules (negative or no Ce anomaly). The sediment pore waters were source of most elements in the Mn-micronodules and to the bottom seawater. The diagenetic processes were the major control on the Fe-Cu-Zn isotope composition of the Mn- micronodules and nodules. Measured Fe-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules can equally be explained by hydrogenetic and diagenetic precipitation. Considering our mineralogical and geochemical data we would suggest a rather diagenetic than hydrogenetic control on the Fe-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules: suboxic diagenetic reduction of the sedimentary Fe in the sediment, fractionation of Fe-isotopes that produces an isotopically light dissolved Fe pool, which leads to light Fe isotope composition of both the Mn- micronodules and nodules (−0.63 to −0.27‰). The preferential scavenging of 63Cu from seawater on the hydrogenetic Mn-Fe-oxyhydroxides accounts for the Cu-isotope composition of the hydrogenetic-diagenetic Mn-nodules (+0.21 − +0.35‰), which is lighter than that of seawater. The identical Cu-isotope composition of the diagenetic Mn-micronodules is a result of oxidative dissolution of the sedimentary Cu-containing minerals, release of isotopically heavy Cuaq2+ in the pore waters and record of this diagenetic Cu-isotope pool in the Mn-micronodules. The hydrogenetic-diagenetic Mn-nodules have Zn-isotope composition (+0.75 − +0.87‰) heavier than that of the seawater which is interpreted to be a result of equilibrium isotope partitioning between dissolved and adsorbed Zn: preferential sorption of 66Zn on Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides surfaces. Preferential adsorption of 66Zn from the light Zn isotope pool of the pore waters on the Mn-Fe-oxyhydroxides has resulted in heavy Zn-isotope composition of the Mn-micronodules and diagenetic layers of the Mn-nodules. The lack of robust assessment of the Mn-micronodule abundance in sediment volume unit and the insufficient geochemical data for the Mn-micronodules prevents a meaningful estimation of their resource potential. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A common approach for Augmented Reality labeling is to display the label text on a flag planted into the real world element at a 3D anchor point. When there are more than just a few labels, the efficiency of the interface decreases as the user has to search for a given label sequentially. The search can be accelerated by sorting the labels alphabetically, but sorting all labels results in long and intersecting leader lines from the anchor points to the labels. This paper proposes a partially-sorted concentric label layout that leverages the search efficiency of sorting while avoiding the label display problems of long or intersecting leader lines. The labels are partitioned into a small number of sorted sequences displayed on circles of increasing radii. Since the labels on a circle are sorted, the user can quickly search each circle. A tight upper bound derived from circular permutation theory limits the number of circles and thereby the complexity of the label layout. For example, 12 labels require at most three circles. When the application allows it, the labels are presorted to further reduce the number of circles in the layout. The layout was tested in a user study where it significantly reduced the label searching time compared to a conventional single-circle layout.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Rotor assembly is a core tache in the whole process of aero-engine manufacturing. Preventing out-of-tolerance of concentricity is one of the primary tasks. Conventional assembly approaches are based on a manual test with the dial indicator, depending on experience appraises, which lack systematic and quantitative precision design theory. As a result, two issues need to be solved: the modeling problem of complicated geometric variations in three-dimensions, as well as the abnormal distribution of ubiquitous actual deviations. This work attempts to propose a novel probabilistic approach for three-dimensional variation analysis in rotor assembly. Based on rotor’s revolving characteristics and multistage stacking process, Jacobian–Torsor model is adopted to establish the variation propagation, and Pearson distribution family is used to derive the probability density function, which can quickly determine the variation distribution pattern and efficiently perform statistical variation analysis. A real case of mechanical assemblies consisting of revolving axisymmetric components is concerned. The results show that the suggested method has a similar accuracy, but much higher efficiency than conventional methods. Calculations agree with the experimentations, and the probability distribution type of the part’s variation has an appreciable impact on the final assembly precision. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - While velocity-based training is currently a very popular paradigm to designing and monitoring resistance training programs, its implementation remains a challenge in team sports, where there are still some confusion and misinterpretations of its applications. In addition, in contexts with large squads, it is paramount to understand how to best use movement velocity in different exercises in a useful and time-efficient way. This manuscript aims to provide clarifications on the velocity-based training paradigm, movement velocity tracking technologies, assessment procedures and practical recommendations for its application during resistance training sessions, with the purpose of increasing performance, managing fatigue and preventing injuries. Guidelines to combine velocity metrics with subjective scales to prescribe training loads are presented, as well as methods to estimate 1-Repetition Maximum (1RM) on a daily basis using individual load–velocity profiles. Additionally, monitoring strategies to detect and evaluate changes in performance over time are discussed. Finally, limitations regarding the use of velocity of execution tracking devices and metrics such as “muscle power” are commented upon. Funding: This research received no external funding.

AB  - A photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with sub-wavelength air inner core and Ge-doped concentric ring outer core is proposed. The full vector finite element method with perfectly matched layer is used for simulation. Mode crossing phenomenon which can be controlled through the hollow core diameter is investigated. A PCF with an effective compensated dispersion range of ±1.38 ps/nm/km from 1460 nm to 1637 nm wavelength is designed. The dispersion compensating PCF (DCPCF) can compensate for the dispersion and dispersion slope of a standard single mode fiber (SMF) at the same time. The kappa value matches very well with that of the commercial single mode fiber. Moreover, the figure of merits inside air core region of the proposed DCPCF is improved by 21.3 dB at 1550 nm wavelength compared to a hollow core photonic bandgap (PBG) fiber. This field enhancement can effectively reduce the material loss and the nonlinear accumulation in dispersion compensation fibers. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Named Data Networking is a promising application of Information Concentric Networking. More research is required to improve NDN mobility especially when Interest and Data contents are flooded during transmission. In named data networking framework, data integrity and security are highly guaranteed due to its nature of operation. Although, Information Concentric Networks are to some extend vulnerable to some form of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. these attacks are mostly Interest Flooding Attacks. In this paper, a scalable solution that is capable of moderating complex interest flooding framework for rendezvous and producer nodes mobile routes is implemented by simulation. The simulation involves mobile producer (MP) transmission between the two interfaces (in-out bound) on a network. We further adopt the use an efficient protocol known as the Listen First Broadcast Later for Interest content as they are transmitted by consumer in search for data between nodes of producer and rendezvous in motion. Our implementation ensures preventing attackers at both ends of the links without affecting non attacking consumers and producers. The protocol depends on the mobile producer's Data content reply and use a fix rate adaptation to initiate secured handoff. Simulation results in ndnSIM 2.1 and Wireshark present successful implementation of the producer to rendezvous scalable content delivery between the links. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The present study compared the effects of performing the lateral squat exercise in three different formats from eccentric overload training on concentric/eccentric peak/mean power and inter-limb asymmetries in young soccer players. Methods: Forty-five young male (U-17) soccer players were distributed into three groups. Two groups performed the same training volume with both legs, beginning with the weaker leg (SVW, n = 15) or with the stronger leg (SVS, n = 15). The third group executed double volume with the weaker leg and also commenced with such leg (DVW, n = 15) in the lateral squat during a 10-week period. Pre-and post-intervention metrics included concentric and eccentric peak/mean power during the lateral squat test and their corre-sponding asymmetries. Results: All groups improved all power variables. Concentric mean and peak power asymmetry were substantially reduced in the SVW (ES: 0.89), DVW (ES: 0.43), and in SVW (ES: 1.60). Eccentric mean and peak power asymmetry were also substantially decreased in SVW (ES: 0.81) and in DVW (ES: 0.68). Between-group analyses showed substantially better performance in concentric and eccentric variables with stronger and weaker legs in SVW and DVW groups compared with SVS. Conclusions: Those groups which started with the weaker leg showed greater both power enhancements and reductions on inter-limb asymmetries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Bringing together a team of cutting-edge researchers based in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indo-Pacific countries, this book focuses on the tug of war between China's influence and forces of resistance in Hong Kong, Taiwan and selected countries in its surrounding jurisdictions. China's influence has met growing defiance from citizens in Hong Kong and Taiwan who fear the extinction of their valued local identities. However, the book shows that resistance to China's influence is a global phenomenon, varying in motivation and intensity from region to region and country to country depending on the forms of China's influence and the balances of forces in each society. The book also advances a concentric center-periphery framework for comparing different forms of extra-jurisdictional Chinese influence mechanisms, ranging from economic, military and diplomatic influences to united front operations. This book will be of key interest to scholars and students of comparative politics, international relations, geopolitics, Chinese politics, Hong Kong-China relations, Taiwan and Asian politics. © 2021, Brian C.H.

AB  - SUMMARY: There are a variety of ways to treat chronic elbow dislocations, including repeat closed reduction and immobilization, transarticular pinning, temporary bridge plating, hinged or rigid external fixation, and internal fixator application. Although each have distinct advantages and disadvantages, avoiding recurrent instability is critical. The internal-fixator is a relatively new option to maintain a stable, concentric reduction and facilitate early range of motion. This article and accompanying video describe the surgical technique of using an internal joint stabilizer for treatment of a chronically unstable ulnohumeral joint.

AB  - In recent years, the exotic properties of topological semimetals (TSMs) have attracted great attention and significant efforts have been made in seeking new topological phases and material realization. In this work, we propose a family of TSMs which harbors an unprecedented nodal line (NL) landscape consisting of a pair of concentric intersecting coplanar ellipses (CICEs) at half-filling. Meanwhile, the CICE at half-filling guarantees the presence of a second pair of CICEs beyond half-filling. Both CICEs are linked at fourfold degenerate points at zone boundaries. In addition, we identify the generic criteria for the existence of the CICE in a time-reversal-invariant spinless fermion system or a spinful system with negligible spin-orbital coupling. Consequently, 9 out of 230 space groups (SGs) are feasible for hosting CICEs whose location centers in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) are identified. We provide a simple model with SG Pbam (No. 55) which exhibits CICEs, and the exotic intertwined drumhead surface states, induced by double band inversions. Finally, we propose a series of material candidates that host butterflylike CICE NLs, such as ZrX2 (X=P, As), Tl2GeTe5, CYB2, and Al2Y3. © 2021 American Physical Society.

AB  - In this contribution, three new species of sternaspids collected from sediments along the coast of southern Thailand are described: Petersenaspis apinyae sp. nov. from a depth of 50–80 m offshore in the Gulf of Thailand; P. narisarae sp. nov. from 9 m depth in the Songkhla Sea, Gulf of Thailand; and P. pakbaraensis sp. nov. from tidal mudflats on the Andaman Coast. All three species resemble P. palpallatoci Sendall & Salazar-Vallejo, 2013. They differ mainly in the pigmentation and shape of the shield, the number of ventral chaetae and chaetae at the posterior shield, body papillae, and size of the abdomen. Further, P. apinyae sp. nov. is clearly distinguished from other species of the genus by having dark orange to red butterfly wing-shaped shields, with strongly curved anterior margins. P. narisarae sp. nov. differs from other species by having concentric colored bands over shields and an expanded oval abdomen. P. pakbaraensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species by its dark brown-purple shield and laterally expanded fan. These three species have a unique character in their branchial plates: long brownish filaments. A key to the identification of all species of Petersenaspis is included.

The callus maintained medium was prepared at the same concentration and to rising focus of active substances, glutamine supplemeted with concentricitys (0, 75, 150, 225 or 300) mg.l−1 led to significant growing in both fresh and dry weight of callus, although the glutamine caused significant increase in active compound while analysis by utilyzing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To callus sample founded harmol, harmaline and harmine reaching 257.95, 489.51 and 640.02 µg.ml−1 respectively at 225 mg.l−1 of L-Glutamine. While, treatment with 300 mg.l−1 significantly increased in harmalol and harmane recorded 250.27 and 335.91 µg.ml−1 respectively from fresh weight of callus and amount of alkaloids produced in Cali more than from mother plant. © 2021.

AB  - It is evident that radar sensing is robust technology compared to camera or LiDAR in the case of autonomous vehicles. Since, they are capable of working even under harsh weather conditions like thick fog, glaring sun, etc. The 77-81GHz frequency band for short range radar provides a global framework for automotive radar by preventing collisions, reducing traffic accidents and thus improvingvehicular safety. The proposed antenna resonates at 79GHz. Below-10dB, return loss characteristic greater than -35dB is obtained in the band of 77.5GHz to 80.4GHz (i.e., impedance bandwidth of 2.86GHz) and gain of above 8dB is achieved. Rectangular vias and complementary concentric square loops of the metamaterial structure are introduced to suppress the surface waves and to achieve the desired frequency of resonance. The feed line and the metamaterial structure are positionedaccordinglyto provide a better impedance matching. VSWR obtained is 1.04 and the antenna is linearly polarized and has a low profile. The total dimension of the antenna is 1.96 2.26 0.127mm3. The antenna structure can be used in an array for automotive radar applications. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - During the fracturing process of oil and gas wells, casing eccentricity directly affects the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths, but the law and degree of influence are not clear at present, and there are no measures to address the influence of casing eccentricity on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths. This paper took the lead in developing a set of experimental devices for cement sheath integrity. A comparative experimental study on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths was carried out for the first time under casing concentric and eccentric conditions, and the influence of casing eccentricity on the mechanical integrity of cement sheaths in fractured wells of the Wushi 17-2 oilfield was also investigated. The numerical simulation method was used to perform stress analysis on cement sheaths of fractured wells under casing concentric and eccentric conditions. The influences of casing wall thickness, cement sheath thickness, the elastic modulus of cement sheath, and formation on radial stress of the cement sheath were analyzed, and the mechanical integrity safeguard or remedy measures of the cement sheath under the casing eccentric condition were proposed for the first time. The results show that casing eccentricity can easily lead to stress concentration at the narrow edge of the cement sheath. Under the condition of the same strength of the cement sheath, the integrity of the cement sheath is more likely to fail under the casing eccentric condition. The tensile failure cracks are concentrated at the narrow edge of the cement sheath. With the increase in casing eccentricity, the stress at the narrow edge of the cement sheath increased, the critical failure pressure of the cement sheath decreased, and the failure pressure of cement sheath integrity decreased by 17.72% at a casing eccentricity of 33% compared within a casing eccentricity of 0%. Improving the casing center degree, increasing the casing wall thickness and cement sheath thickness, and reducing the elastic modulus of the cement sheath can minimize the stress of the cement sheath and prevent mechanical integrity failure. This study is helpful to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the cement sheath in fractured wells accurately and can provide a technical reference for optimizing the casing center degree.  ©

AB  - Background: Fencing is a combat sport, which depends of lower limbs muscular strength and neuromuscular function. Because of that, approximately half of all injuries occur in lower limbs, especially in ankle. Thus, the objective of this study was to verify the influence of a twelve-week proprioceptive training program on ankle muscular strength and muscular balance in fencers. Methods: The study was a clinical trial, with 19 fencing athletes from 14 to 35-year-old. The main outcome was ankle invertors, evertors, plantiflexors and dorsiflexors muscular strength and ankle muscle balance. The study was performed in six stages: familiarization of muscular strength test in isokinetic dynamometer; pre-intervention; intervention; post-intervention; three- and six-months follow-up. At pre-intervention stage, the muscular strength was evaluated. At intervention stage, the athletes performed 12-week proprioceptive training program, three times a week. At post-intervention, three- and the six-months follow-ups, same pre-intervention test was performed. Results: The proprioceptive training improved front leg ankle dorsiflexor strength at three- and six-months follow-ups compared to pre-intervention. Furthermore, training increased the front leg dorsiflexors/plantiflexors conventional ratio at three- and six-months follow-ups compared to pre-intervention; and evertors/invertors conventional ratio at three-months follow-up compared to pre-intervention; and evertors/invertors functional ratio at post-intervention and three- and six-months follow-ups compared to pre-intervention. Conclusions: The improvement and/or maintenance of ankle muscle strength occurred in intervention group seems to be due to stimulus provided by proprioceptive training, with ankle dorsiflexors being the most stimulated group. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cloaking methods of infinite length coaxial cylindrical and concentric spherical invisibility cloaks in the non-uniform static field are investigated. First, the arbitrary potential function at the infinite boundary is expanded into a series of orthogonal potential functions. When there is only the nth order orthogonal potential function distribution at the infinite boundary, the analytical cloaking conditions of both the infinite length coaxial cylindrical and concentric spherical cloaks are derived. Furthermore, based on the analytical cloaking conditions, the approaching cloaking method is proposed in a complex non-uniform static field which composed of multiple orders potential functions. This method can acquire the optimal cloaking condition and avoid the iteration process by using numerical methods such as the finite element method etc. Finally, three examples are given to verify the correctness of the analytical cloaking conditions and the effectiveness of the approaching cloaking method proposed in this paper. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Monajati, A, Larumbe-Zabala, E, Sampson, MG, and Naclerio, F. Injury prevention programs based on flywheel vs. body weight resistance in recreational athletes. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S188-S196, 2021-This study compares the effect of an isoinertial flywheel technology vs. a traditional gravity-dependent exercise protocol on modifiable factors associated with the incidence of hamstring strain (HAM) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Furthermore, the effect on repeated sprint ability was also considered. Eighteen recreationally trained volleyball players completed one of the following 6-week protocols: (a) flywheel (FY) included 3 exercises using a YoYo isoinertial-squat machine and 3 exercises with a Versa-Pulley isoinertial device, and (b) gravity-dependent (GT) involved 6 similar exercises with no external resistance (participants' body weight). Both programs consisted in 2 sessions·wk-1 performing 2 sets of 8 repetitions with 2 minutes of rest. Outcomes included a 10-second tuck jump assessment (TJA), landing knee valgus score, hamstring and quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokinetic 60°·s-1 peak torque, optimal peak torque localization, conventional and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and 30-m repeated shuttle sprint ability (RSSA) test. FY improved TJA (-2, interquartile range [IQR] = -3 to -1) and valgus (-1, IQR = -1 to 0) scores, hamstring eccentric (20.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.27-31.47 N·m) and concentric (17.87, 95% CI = 0.40-35.34 N·m) peak torque, as well as the RSSA (-0.28, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.10 seconds), whereas GT only improved hamstring eccentric peak torque (21.41, 95% CI = 9.00-33.82 N·m). A 6-week protocol using flywheel technology seems to elicit better positive adaptations to protect athletes from HAM and ACL injuries and to enhance RSSA performance compared to exercising with no external resistance other than athletes' body weight.

AB  - Both the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) and the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are notorious for dominating hard substrates in freshwater ecosystems throughout most of the Northern hemisphere. Despite widespread observations of a dominance shift favouring D. bugensis, where both Ponto-Caspian dreissenids co-occur, mechanisms driving this shift are still largely unknown. This study assessed whether movement behaviour differs between these two mussel species. That way we aimed at assessing whether mobility might be a contributing driver to the observed dominance shift. The mobility of dreissenids was assessed in an experimental set-up consisting of polyethene tanks marked with squares and concentric circles facilitating location tracking of the dreissenids by time-lapse photography. Specimens were collected at the Haringvliet and Hollands Diep in the Rhine-Meuse river delta. The experiments mimicked unfavourable habitat conditions by drying, cleaning, tagging and placing mussels in a new environment. After these disturbances, the movement rate, duration, distance, pattern and speed of 299 individuals were monitored. For both species, most individuals moved in more or less circular patterns, causing their actual movement distance to be twice as high as their displacement distance. The average movement duration within 24 hours after the start of each experiment was 65 min, with an average speed of 28 cm/h and an average distance of 29 cm. Hereby no significant differences were found between D. polymorpha and D. bugensis. However, a higher top speed was observed for D. bugensis than for D. polymorpha. The fastest individuals of these two species moved at 90 cm/h and 60 cm/h, respectively. Moreover, about twice as many D. bugensis individuals moved during the experiments in comparison to D. polymorpha individuals. Hereby it was recorded that any point in time close to 10% more D. bugensis specimens were moving around. The results support our hypothesis that D. bugensis could have a competitive benefit over D. polymorpha by having a higher top speed and a significantly higher number of individuals moving after a disturbance of their population. Detachment and mobility of sessile mussel species are supposed to be avoidance mechanisms during unfavourable environmental conditions. Therefore, mobility might be one of the contributing drivers of the observed dominance shift between both species. © D’Hont et al.

AB  - In this work, we are proposing a silicon (Si) based concentric tube broadband absorber. The proposed broadband absorber is composed of consecutive concentric tubes of intrinsic Si and doped-Si (D-Si) layers. The structure exhibits a broadband performance within a wide range of mid-IR wavelength spectrum extending from 3 to 7 µm with an absorption peak that varies between 0.88 and 0.97 in the case of S-polarized incident light. We report that light coupling to the proposed concentric tube metamaterial absorber structure over a broad wavelength range is a result of exhibiting multiple resonance mechanisms at different wavelengths. We further show that bulk plasmon polaritons are excited within the layers leading to this noticeable absorption. We demonstrate CMOS compatible metamaterial absorber that is less dependent on polarization and angle. Furthermore, this proposed design reveals new avenues to realize silicon-based broadband absorption for mid-IR photo detection and mid-IR thermal harvesting applications. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB  - While granular segregation in partially filled containers has been studied extensively, granular dynamics in densely filled spheres is not fully understood. Here, surface band segregation and granular convection are reported in a rotating sphere of highly compacted glass beads. Distinct from the Rayleigh-Bénard convection, granular convection has a butterfly shaped structure with vortexes of alternating layers of small/large beads, which is stable and independent of the sphere size. Two concentric interfaces at the zero tangential/norm flux are discovered, which divide the sphere into three layers from the surface to the core. The law that governs the jamming dynamics in rotating spheres remains an open question. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Background/aim The purpose of this study was to compare the isokinetic peak torque profiles from the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles during concentric and eccentric contractions in elite Brazilian soccer players across different field positions and age categories. Our hypothesis was that soccer players from different field positions are subjected to different ageing-related effects on their isokinetic peak torque. Methods This is a retrospective study based on professional elite-level soccer players between the years 2009 and 2019. It included 570 adult males who played for at least 5 years on first or second Brazilian divisions. Playing positions were divided as: goalkeepers, defenders, sidebacks, midfielders and forwards. Age categories were also divided as: G1 (17-20 years old), G2 (21-24 years old), G3 (25-28 years old), G4 (29-32 years old) and G5 (33 years old or more). Results The results indicate a moderate effect of age (F(4545)=8.197; p<0.001; Î • 2 =0.057) and a small effect of playing position (F(4545)=2.993; p<0.05; Î • 2 =0.021) on torque of concentric extensors; mainly from midfielders and goalkeepers with 29 years or more. Conclusions Soccer players from different field positions are subjected to different ageing related effects on their muscular performance during their career special attention should be given to these players to avoid reduction in physical performance. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Soilborne Rhizoctonia, Microdochium, and Fusarium species are major causal agents of seedling and stem-base diseases of wheat. Currently, seed treatments are considered the most effective solution for their control. Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis groups (AGs) 2-1 and 5, R. cerealis, Microdochium, and Fusarium spp., were used in series of field experiments to determine their capability to cause soilborne and stem-base disease and to quantify their comparative losses in the establishment and yield of wheat. The effectiveness and response to seed treatment formulated with 10 g sedaxane and 5 g fludioxonil 100 kg21 against these soilborne pathogens were also determined. Our results showed that damping-off caused by soilborne R. cerealis was associated with significant reductions in the emergence and establishment, resulting in stunted growth and low plant numbers. The pathogen also caused sharp eyespot associated with reductions in the ear partitioning index. R. solani AG 2-1 and AG 5 were weakly pathogenic and failed to cause significant damping-off, root rot, and stem-base disease in wheat. Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum applied as soilborne inoculum failed to cause severe disease. Microdochium spp. caused brown foot rot disease and soilborne M. nivale reduced wheat emergence. Applications of sedaxane and fludioxonil increased plant emergence and reduced damping-off, early stem-base disease, and brown foot rot, thus providing protection against multiple soilborne pathogens. R. cerealis reduced the thousand grain weight by 3.6%, whereas seed treatment including fludioxonil and sedaxane against soilborne R. cerealis or M. nivale resulted in a 4% yield increase. © 2021 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Two weeks before the university lockdown, a group of twenty-three students from the Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning (IGOT) were invited to draw their image of the city of Lisbon and environs. The objective of the exercise was to compare their initial vision of the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon (AML) with the subsequent research conducted in situ, aimed at the investigation of urban planning and sustainability issues that needed intervention and change. As the university went online the 10th of March 2020, fieldwork became an impossibility. In alternative, the class was asked to identify the three main street grids, existent within the AML: (i) rectangular; (ii) irregular; and (iii) radio-concentric. To complement their assignment on the issue of urban morphology, the research further included the examination of three main square designs: (i) monumental; (ii) traffic squares; and (iii) gathering or reunion. Mental maps of cities were first used to evaluate the image of urban environments by their residents, in the work of Kevin Lynch, published in the 1960s. In this contribution, the mental maps of Lisbon drawn by the students were accompanied by an enquiry sheet with several personal data, as well as their plans for the future. In spite of the confinement, it was possible to overcome some movement limitations as, using Google Earth and Street View tools, the class examined in detail the urban morphology of the AML. In contrast, the impossibility to stroll along the streets, to interview city residents, service providers and traders, prevented the students from acquiring the necessary skills to propose urban renewal. Conclusion was that online work makes reproductive research plausible but innovation research is highly unlikely achieved. The usage of mental maps as a teaching strategy is, however, a good option, both in online and in-person Urban Geography classes.  © 2021 WIT Press.

AB  - The loss of the correctly classified samples is counted as zero by classical spherical classifier in extremely imbalanced classification. The decision function is constructed only by misclassified samples. In this paper, a smooth reward-penalty loss function with lower bound is proposed. The loss of the correctly classified samples is counted as negative in the proposed loss function. Therefore, the reward of the objective function can be realized and the interference of noise near the boundary can be avoided. Based on maximum margin of twin spheres support vector machine, a maximum margin of twin sphere model via combined reward-penalty loss function with lower bound(RPMMTS) is established. Two concentric spheres are constructed by RPMMTS using Newton's method. The majority samples are captured in the small sphere and the extra space are eliminated at the same time. By increasing the margin between two concentric spheres, the minority samples are pushed out of the large sphere as many as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed loss function makes RPMMTS better than other unbalanced classification algorithms in classification performance. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - A new seismic design method is proposed for the columns in two-story steel concentrically braced frames with bracing members intersecting columns between the floors. The method is intended to improve the stability of braced frame columns taking into account the interaction between the stories when the braces respond in the inelastic range. Furthermore, the proposed method aims to prevent excessive inelastic deformation in the braces intersecting columns between the floors considering the interaction between the stories, which otherwise may lead to brace fracture. The proposed design method is first presented in the framework of the North American steel design standards, followed by a design example to illustrate the method. Dynamic analyses are then performed to validate the design method and evaluate the seismic performance of the frame designed with and without the consideration of the method. The adequacy of the proposed method is assessed using further dynamic analyses when the location of the weakest braced panel is altered, oversized braces are used, and column orientation is changed. The results show that the proposed method can appropriately predict the column design forces, prevent column instability taking into consideration the interaction between inelastic brace responses in adjacent stories, thus improving the seismic response of the braced frame. © 2021 Institution of Structural Engineers

AB  - Continuum robots are highly miniaturizable, exhibit non-linear shapes with several curves, and are flexible and compliant. In particular, concentric-tube and tendon-driven continuum robots can be designed on a small scale with diameters of below 10 mm. A small diameter-to-length ratio enables insertion of these robots through small entry points in order to reach hardly accessible regions by avoiding obstacles. This scenario can often be found in minimally invasive surgery and technical inspections. However, to reach the target region, a deployment along a narrow tortuous path is often required. Common tendon-driven continuum robots are intrinsically incapable of such deployment and concentric-tube continuum robots require special path conditions and intensive parameter optimization. Other proposed robot types, such as hyper-redundant and pneumatically actuated robots, exhibit less favorable diameter-to-length ratios and are thus not suitable for those tasks. Since the limiting factors are found in the design of continuum robots, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot design, which features an additional degree of freedom in each robot section. The backbone is composed of straight, concentrically arranged tubes, each of which composes a section and is used to adapt its length. We present a three-section continuum robot prototype with a diameter of 7 mm, determine its follow-the-leader capabilities theoretically, and validate the results experimentally using model-based control. For our 165 mm long robot prototype, the repeatability is below 2.38 mm. The model accuracy reaches a median of 3.16% over 25 configurations with respect to robot length. The path-following error over five curvilinear paths results in median errors of 2.59% with respect to robot length. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction. This study finds the lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters on variable heights. Objective. This research aims to reveal the effects of drop height on lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters. Methods. Two AMTI force platforms and Vicon motion capture system were used to collect kinematic and dynamic signals of the lower limbs. Results. The drop height had significant effects on peak vertical ground reaction force and peak vertical ground reaction force in the extension phase, lower limbs' support moment, eccentric power of the hip joint, eccentric power of the knee joint, eccentric power of the ankle joint, and concentric power of the hip joint. The drop height had no significant effects on the reactive strength index. Reactive strength index (RSI) had no significant correlations with the personal best of high jumpers. The optimal loading height for the maximum reactive strength index was 0.45 m. Conclusion. The optimal loading height for the reactive strength index can be used for explosive power training and lower extremity injury prevention.  © 2021 Zehao Tong et al.

AB  - The rubber cylinder of 139.7 mm casing test packer cannot meet the safety test requirements of ultra-deep reservoir limited by its temperature resistance and pressure resistance properties. According to the test, the retrievable hanging packer meets standards of the API 11D1-V3 level, whose temperature resistance is 204℃ and pressure resistance is 105 MPa. It is equipped with concentric bypass mechanism, which reduces the tripping swabbing and locking mechanism of packer to avoid the upward movement of outer barrel string due to the friction resistance of casing wall during tripping. In addition, AFLAS material and adding a shoulder protection combined three rubber cylinder structure at both ends of the sealant cylinder improve the sealing differential pressure of the packer. Indoor forward and reverse pressure reversal test according to API 11D1-V3 level and field test show that the packer is reliable under high temperature and high pressure, which is qualified when pressure improve to 105 MPa. The packer can meet the requirements of oil testing in high temperature and high pressure ultra-deep wells and provide support for the development of oil testing technology in ultra-deep wells. © 2021, The Editorial Department of Well Testing.

AB  - A MIMO antenna having circular patch with CPW feeding is proposed in this paper. Design, Simulation, Fabrication and testing of MIMO antenna with different band notching characteristics are proposed in this paper. The designed antennas are suitable for portable UWB applications. UWB is the most promising technology which provides high data rate with in short range. In 2002 Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has approved a frequency band of 3.1–10.6 GHz for unlicensed applications. Within the band of UWB some of the wireless Communication bands with different frequencies are also operating. So to avoid interference, band dispensation characteristics are proposed. In this paper single dual, triple and quad band notch MIMO antennas are designed, simulated and tested and their results are reported. Elimination of interference with existing wireless bands like WiMAX, WLAN, X—Band Satellite Communication System and ITU is the prime focus of the paper. Concentric rings with rectangular split bricks are placed on the patch to eliminate the interference with the existing bands. Different antennas are designed and simulated using CST microwave studio software and the antenna parameters like Return losses (S11), Gain, VSWR, Radiation patterns and Correlation Coefficient are measured. Quad band notch antenna is fabricated using RT/Duroid 5880 substrate material with height 1.57 mm. To get better Isolation the antennas are placed vertically and a stub is placed in between the antennas. The quad band antenna able to notch WiMAX, WLAN, X—band and ITU band and port Isolation (S12) is very good and envelope correlation is below 0.001 in UWB frequency spectrum. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - “Teodor Cincu” History Museum owns, in its collection, five bronze rings; no information is held for two of them, while for the other three it is known that they were donated by professor Ion T. Sion, together with other archaeological finds and historical documents. The metal rings are classified as ornamental jewelry and are frequently discovered within settlements and necropolis. These items are made either by the local blacksmiths or, by travelling craftsmen, who with simple tools, could create various accessories, at client's request. From a topological point of view, the rings in question can be classified as follows: Rings with the head casted at the same time with the shank and rings with the head attached to the shank. From a functional point of view, all five are classified as signet rings. Their signet head is engraved with one or more decorative motifs. The ideographic representations contain the following elements: cross, concentric circles, crescent and bird motifs. As the signet rings were made of non-precious metals and the metal pill presents apotropaic motifs and not heraldry elements, it is considered that they belonged to some free owners. All five aforementioned rings date back from the XVII-XVIII centuries. © 2021, History Museum of Galati. All rights reserved.

AB  - A self-adaptive differential evolution neutron spectrum unfolding algorithm (SDENUA) is established in this study to unfold the neutron spectra obtained from a water-pumping-injection multilayered concentric sphere neutron spectrometer (WMNS). Specifically, the neutron fluence bounds are estimated to accelerate the algorithm convergence, and the minimum error between the optimal solution and input neutron counts with relative uncertainties is limited to 10–6 to avoid unnecessary calculations. Furthermore, the crossover probability and scaling factor are self-adaptively controlled. FLUKA Monte Carlo is used to simulate the readings of the WMNS under (1) a spectrum of Cf-252 and (2) its spectrum after being moderated, (3) a spectrum used for boron neutron capture therapy, and (4) a reactor spectrum. Subsequently, the measured neutron counts are unfolded using the SDENUA. The uncertainties of the measured neutron count and the response matrix are considered in the SDENUA, which does not require complex parameter tuning or an a priori default spectrum. The results indicate that the solutions of the SDENUA agree better with the IAEA spectra than those of MAXED and GRAVEL in UMG 3.1, and the errors of the final results calculated using the SDENUA are less than 12%. The established SDENUA can be used to unfold spectra from the WMNS. © 2021, China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

AB  - Background: The use of an eccentric glenosphere (EG) has been proposed as a way to prevent scapular notching in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of an EG decreases scapular notching compared with matched standard concentric glenosphere (CG) controls. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed. This study included 49 RSAs with an EG and 49 paired RSAs with a CG with a minimum 60 months of both clinical and radiographic follow-up. Clinical and radiologic outcomes of the EG and CG groups were compared at inclusion and at the last follow-up using the paired Student t test for quantitative data and the χ2 test for qualitative data. Scapular notching was graded according to the Sirveaux classification. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. Results: Notching was observed 2.7 times (95% confidence interval, 1.0-6.8 times) more often in the CG group (P = .037). The difference in notching severity between the groups was not statistically relevant; however, there was a trend toward more severe notching in the CG group (P = .059). Compared with a CG, an EG did not increase the percentage of radiolucent lines around the screws (3% vs. 1.5%, P = .62), around the post (3% vs. 1.5%, P = .62), or below the baseplate (15% vs. 7.5%, P = .18). Conclusion: EGs are associated with less notching than CGs. This finding confirms that RSA with an EG is an effective procedure without specific complications at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. © 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees

AB  - Compared with traditional gear transmission, the multi-branch split-torsion gear transmission system has the advantages of large transmission power, small size and high reliability, so it is more and more used in high-speed heavy load occasions such as ships and aircraft. Since the transmission system of multi-branch split torsional gears belongs to over-constrained configuration, it is necessary to meet strict tooth matching condition in the design process in order to realize the correct synchronous meshing of each branch,which is of great significance to ensure its uniform installation and motion synchronization.Aiming at the coaxial six-branch twisted herringbone gear transmission system, this paper establishes a calculation method for the proper meshing conditions of each branch on the basis of considering the movement synchronization of each branch and preventing geometric interference. In addition, the calculation of gear allocation was carried out for a ship's power transmission system, and a parameter scheme that satisfies the requirements of transmission ratio, concentricity and synchronous meshing was obtained. The correctness of the calculation method of tooth matching in this paper is verified by three-dimensional modeling. This method has universal application value to the tooth matching design of other coaxial multi-branch gear transmissions. © 2021 Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University.

AB  - The hotplate precipitation gauge operates by means of a thermodynamic principle. It is composed of a small disk with two thin aluminum heated plates on the upper and lower faces. Each plate has three concentric rings to prevent the hydrometeors from sliding off in strong wind. As for the more widely used tipping-bucket and weighing gauges, measurements are affected by the wind-induced bias due to the bluff-body aerodynamics of the instrument outer shape. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations were numerically solved, using a k–ω shear stress transport closure model, to simulate the aerodynamic influence of the gauge body on the airflow. Wind tunnel tests were conducted to validate simulation results. Solid particle trajectories were modeled using a Lagrangian particle tracking model to evaluate the influence of the airflow modification on the ability of the instrument to collect the incoming hydrometeors. A suitable parameterization of the particle size distribution, as a function of the snowfall intensity, was employed to calculate the collection efficiency (CE) under different wind conditions. Results reveal a relevant role of the three rings in enhancing the collection performance of the gauge. Below 7.5 m s-1, the CE curves linearly decrease with increasing the wind speed, while beyond that threshold, the blocking caused by the rings counter effects the aerodynamic induced undercatch, and the CE curves quadratically increase with the wind speed. At high wind speed, the undercatch vanishes and the instrument exhibits a rapidly increasing overcatch. For operational purposes, adjustment curves were formulated as a function of the wind speed and the measured snowfall intensity. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - This article introduces a second-order direction splitting method for solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes–Boussinesq system in a spherical shell region. The equations are solved on overset Yin–Yang grids, combined with spherical coordinate transforms. This approach allows to avoid the singularities at the poles and keeps the grid size relatively uniform. The downside is that the spherical shell is subdivided into two equally sized, overlapping subdomains that requires the use of Schwarz-type iterations. The temporal second-order accuracy is achieved via an artificial compressibility scheme with bootstrapping. The spatial discretization is based on second-order finite differences on the Marker-And-Cell stencil. The entire scheme is implemented in parallel using a domain decomposition iteration and a direction splitting approach for the local solves. The stability, accuracy, and weak scalability of the method is verified on a manufactured solution of the Navier–Stokes–Boussinesq system while its practicality is demonstrated on the natural convection problem in the gap between two concentric spheres. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) have collaborated in a Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation (CEOI) sponsored project to design a deployable Cassegrain telescope. Optical telescopes are currently flown with a fixed focal length, set by the desired magnification, which limits their use to larger satellites. Incorporating a deployable system, to extend to the fixed length from a smaller volume, could open the door for smaller satellites to carry larger optical telescopes, making Earth observation more accessible for research and businesses. The aim of this project was to increase the capability of small satellites for Earth observation by demonstrating a proof of concept breadboard and development model of a deployable Cassegrain telescope. The design shows excellent repeatability when deployed and meets the stiffness requirements to avoid on board micro-vibrations distorting images. The design uses three concentric composite barrels that deploy using a leadscrew-gear train. The design, analysis and test campaign is documented in this paper, as well as the lessons learnt on completion of the project. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of coordinating multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a circular formation around a moving target. The main contribution is allowing for versatile formation patterns on the basis of the following components. Firstly, new uniform spacing control laws are proposed that spread the agents not necessarily over a full circle, but over a circular arc. Uniform spacing formation controllers are proposed, regulating either the separation distances or the separation angles between agents. Secondly, the use of virtual agents is proposed to allow for different radii in agents' orbits. Thirdly, a hierarchical combination of formation patterns is described. A Lyapunov analysis is conducted to study the stability characteristics. This paper also addresses the practical issue of collision avoidance that arises while UAVs are developing formations. An additional control component is added that repels agents to steer away from each other once they get too close. All UAVs have constant linear velocities. Control of the UAV is via its yaw rate. The proposed extensions to formation on a portion of a circle, circling on different radii for different agents, formation in local geometric shapes, and inter-vehicle collision avoidance, provide more complete solution to cooperative target tracking in concentric formations. © 2021 Acta Press.

AB  - We propose an active meta-lens that can dynamically switch the coaxial focus on three statuses with the external optical pump. The meta-lens composes of two concentric sets of complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) arrays, which function at different focal lengths, atop the silicon on sapphire substrate.With specifically structured phase distribution, the meta-lens can form completely separated double foci simultaneously. Through illuminating the internal or external CSRR arrays individually with patterned optical pump, the meta-lens switches to single focus at different points. The proposed design provides a new avenue for developing terahertz multifunctional devices applied in microscope imaging and tomography. © 2021 OSA - The Optical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application range of hyperspectral imaging is subject to the operational system platform especially relies on the core imaging spectrometer. With a rising practical requirement of extensive remote sensing recently, the traditional method of two or multiple separate imaging submodules combined has obviously brought inevitable shortages in certain cases such as mineral detection or environmental monitoring, etc. Not only is the whole imaging system somewhat so large in physical size and so high in weight that it has an objective influence on convenience as well as flexibility in actual operation, but also each independent instrument has unique optical parameters and assembling matrices after fabrication and alignment which is against the image consistency. Instead of common image correction and data processing, the essential solution is to set up a broadband integrative system platform. This paper introduces a new prototype of imaging spectrometer in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) to short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. Different from most existing research-based and commercial VNIR to SWIR imaging spectrometers, it is designed as broadband integration of a single core module. The main optical system consists of a collimating mirror, a central dispersive spherical prism, a converging mirror and two plane mirrors on the sides, which is similar to the normal convex grating spectrometer of three-concentric-mirror (Offner) configuration. The imaging spectrometer has relatively high imaging quality and satisfactory instantaneous field of view (IFOV) with a fairly compact internal structure benefiting from the integrated design and conscientious fabrication. The approach not only avoids extra expense and alignment complexities of multiple spectrometers but also enhances radiometric stability and reduces stray light and polarization effects. Relative performance tests are performed in various specific environment and validating imaging experiments are represented on schedule to demonstrate the expectant effectiveness of the whole system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background Studies have grouped different overhead sports and evaluated together the isokinetic strength of shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) rotator muscles. However, muscular adaptations could be a consequence of the specific sport, and some strength imbalance between these muscles may exist as a consequence of the muscular demand unique to the sport. Therefore, grouping different overhead sports together may not be adequate. Purpose To compare strength balance ratios between different overhead sports (volleyball, handball, swimming, judo, baseball, softball, functional movements performed at high-intensity interval training, and tennis) with a control athletic group (no overhead group). Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods A total of 237 athletes were submitted to isokinetic shoulder strength tests. The isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque values of shoulder internal IR and external ER rotator muscles were measured. Conventional (CR) and functional strength ratios (FR) were calculated. Results There were no significant differences between the sports for the CR in the male group. Female softball athletes (90.4±13.6%) had a significantly higher CR than judo (67.3±6.9%), volleyball (74.9±15.9%), and swimming athletes (70.3±8.7%). In the female group, judo athletes had lower FR values (0.76±0.19) than soccer athletes (1.31±0.35), volleyball athletes (1.24±0.27), functional movements performed at high intensity (1.10±0.1), and softball athletes (1.40±0.39). Female handball athletes also had a lower FR (0.99±0.25) than soccer athletes (1.31±0.35) and softball athletes (1.40±0.39). Male handball (0.90±0.23), tennis (0.86±0.30), and judo (0.68±0.22) athletes had lower FR values than soccer athletes (1.20±0.21) and volleyball athletes (1.25±0.28). Conclusions CR for males may be analyzed together, as there were no significant differences between them. However, for females, the CR for softball athletes should be analyzed individually. As there were several differences between the overhead sports according to the FRs, the authors suggest caution in grouping overhead athletes across multiple sports. These results could have important implications for the design of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs associated with the shoulder joint in overhead sports. © 2021, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

AB  - We formulate an integrated mathematical model for distribution of the injured on a three-type transportation network with destroyable independent links and with actual travel times considering two different groups of the injured. The aim is to find the temporary locations for aid stations and their capacities, the percentage of the injured with various severities allocated to each station and to different routes and the number of vehicles so that the total relief time is minimized. For this, we present a new approach, called circle-based approach, in which the effects of the disaster are considered as a number of concentric circular regions. The original problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear mathematical model. To solve large problems, two algorithms, an evolutionary algorithm based on simulated annealing and a discrete version of the imperialist competitive algorithm, are developed. An empirical study of the earthquakes in the city of Tehran, Iran, is conducted. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The nymphalid groundplan is an archetypical color pattern of nymphalid butterflies involving three major symmetry systems and a discal symmetry system, which share the basic morphogenesis unit. Here, the morphological and spatial relationships among these symmetry systems were studied based on cross-species comparisons of nymphalid hindwings. Based on findings in Neope and Symbrenthia, all three major symmetry systems can be expressed as bands, spots, or eyespot-like structures, suggesting equivalence (homology) of these systems in developmental potential. The discal symmetry system can also be expressed as various structures. The discal symmetry system is circularly surrounded by the central symmetry system, which may then be surrounded by the border and basal symmetry systems, based mainly on findings in Agrias, indicating a unified supersymmetry system covering the entire wing. The border symmetry system can occupy the central part of the wing when the central symmetry system is compromised, as seen in Callicore. These results suggest that butterfly color patterns are hierarchically constructed in a self-similar fashion, as the fractal geometry of the nymphalid groundplan. This self-similarity is likely mediated by the serial induction of organizers, and symmetry breaking of the system morphology may be generated by the collision of opposing signals during development. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Radio-frequency (RF) driven helicon plasma sources can produce relatively high-density plasmas (n > 1019 m-3) at relatively moderate powers (<2 kW) in argon. However, to produce similar high-density plasmas for fusion relevant gases such as hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and helium (He), much higher RF powers are needed. For very high RF powers, thermal issues of the RF-transparent dielectric window, used in the RF source design, limit the plasma operation timescales. To mitigate this constraint, we have designed, built and tested a novel helicon plasma source assembly with a fully liquid-cooled RF-transparent window which allows steady state operations at high power (up to 20 kW) and successfully produces high-density plasma with both argon and H. Deionized (DI) water, flowing between two concentric dielectric RF windows, is used as the coolant. We show that a full azimuthal blanket of DI water does not prevent high-density plasma production. From calorimetry on the DI water, we measure the net heat removed by the coolant at steady state conditions. Using infra-red imaging, we calculate the constant plasma heat deposition and measure the final steady state temperature distribution patterns on the inner surface of the ceramic layer. The heat deposition pattern follows the helical shape of the antenna. We also show the consistency between the heat absorbed by the DI water, as measured by calorimetry, and the total heat due to the combined effect of the plasma heating and the absorbed RF. These results are being used to answer critical engineering questions for the 200 kW RF device materials plasma exposure experiment being designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a next generation plasma material interaction device.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the Stoic view, perception (aisthanesthai, antilēpsis), positive and negative non-indifference (oikeiōsis and allotriōsis) and care (epimeleia, syntērēsis) are not exactly the same. But this does not prevent them from being inseparably connected with each other, like different aspects of the same thing. As it turns out, they cannot take place independently from one another: (a) all perception is intrinsically non-indifference-related and care-related, (b) all positive and negative non-indifference is intrinsically perception-related and care-related, and (c) all care is intrinsically perception-related and non-indifference-related. Secondly, perception has nothing to do with a multiplicity of isolated fragments – with an ‘archipelago’ of unconnected ‘perceptual patches’ scattered across a ‘sea’ of non-perception. And pretty much the same holds true for positive viz. negative non-indifference and for care: there is no such thing as an ‘archipelago’ of isolated ‘enclaves’ of non-indifference – or, for that matter, of isolated ‘enclaves’ of care – scattered across a ‘sea’ of total indifference and carelessness. All three – perception, positive viz. negative non-indifference and care – work as an uninterrupted, unified, complete and coherent whole. In other words, all three have the structure of what might be termed a field: the field-of-perception-non-indifference-and-care. Thirdly, this field has the shape of what might be described as a centred multiplicity or a centred manifold: a series of concentric circles, as it were, revolving around a focal point and constituted in such a way that everything in them is intrinsically related to the focal point and defines itself in terms of its connection with it. Put another way, the field-of-perception-non-indifference-and-care has the structure of Hierocles’ well-known circles. The latter do not describe a particular phenomenon (the specific network of ‘intersubjective’ relationships): in the final analysis they highlight the structure of the whole field – i.e. at the same time (a) its invariable form and (b) the very form of its variability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The use of UAVs or drones for criminal or terrorist enterprises is an increasing problem. Many countermeasures have been proposed to prevent, deter, detect and/or mitigate the dangers posed by such malicious UAVs. One such countermeasure is to track or pursue a malicious UAV back to its point of origin using one or more surveillance UAVs in order to apprehend the UAV and possibly its owner. If the malicious UAV has a higher capability set than the surveillance UAVs, it will be able to outrun any one of them, and therefore the tracking responsibility must be distributed over a swarm of surveillance UAVs that are geographically dispersed across the tracking area of interest. One aspect of particular interest is how the initial formation of the swarm of surveillance UAVs impacts its ability to successfully track a malicious UAV. In this paper, we examine a specific circular initial swarm formation comprising uniformly spaced concentric rings of uniformly spaced UAVs. The total number of surveillance UAVs follows the sequence of centred hexagonal numbers as the number of rings increases. The tracking performance of this circular swarm of surveillance UAVs is compared to a reference swarm of the same size in which the initial locations of the UAVs are randomly chosen. Two tracking strategies are considered: 1) Reactive tracking, in which each surveillance UAV acts independently of the others and only pursues the malicious UAV when it itself detects it, and 2) Reactive tracking with predictive pre-positioning, in which once one surveillance UAV detects the malicious UAV, it communicates the estimated trajectory and speed of the malicious UAV to all swarm members so they can predictively move to a more optimum tracking position before the malicious UAV arrives. The results demonstrate that this particular circular swarm of surveillance UAVs has superior tracking performance relative to the reference randomly positioned swarm of the same size; this is true for both tracking strategies, but particularly when predictive pre-positioning is employed with a relatively small number of surveillance UAVs. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Breast cancer is a victor among the most comprehensively saw malignancies among ladies around the world. Clump territory from mammogram helps in right on time affirmation for breast tumor. A PC-aided detection structure which will see also perceive the subverting lumps in person’s breast in an unmistakable and fiscally able way is required. It is the fantasy and reason for experts to have a CAD framework with most important affectability and low fake positives per picture (FPI). Affirmation of clump from person’s breast is badly arranged considering its plenteous geomorphological attributes and questionable edges. Clump territory execution can be overhauled by utilizing productive preprocessing instrument and geomorphological features of the clump area. As a clump makes, it enrages the breast parenchyma and widens by stirring up different coaxial layers. Geomorphological assessment of these coaxial layers is a foundation in clump conspicuous verification figuring. Particular CAD structures utilizing coaxial morphology show exist as a bit of the creation. In this article, an endeavor has made to plot a piece of the current CAD frameworks which utilize coaxial morphology appear for precisely on time and exact zone of clumps. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Low-ductility steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings are considered to have reserve capacity after brace failure. This study proposes a series of shake table tests of a scaled two-bay, three-story, moment-resisting frame model with a pair of square hollow section braces placed in a chevron arrangement to examine its dynamic behavior. The model structure was repeatedly subjected to two earthquake records with successively increasing magnitudes. The failure mechanisms, reserve capacity, and overall collapse performance were investigated. The results show that the reserve system is sensitive to spectral characteristics of ground motions, especially for soft soil site ground motions. © ASCE.

AB  - Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport where players mainly use their dominant arm for throwing a flying disc. Little is known about possible functional adaptations to this unilateral strain. The purpose of this study was to investigate shoulder rotation strength and range of motion (ROM) in elite Ultimate Frisbee players. We were especially interested in possible sport-specific functional adaptations of peak torque and work ratios as well as the range of motion of agonist and antagonist shoulder rotators regarding laterality between the dominant and non-dominant body sides. For this reason, the concentric external and internal isokinetic (60°/s) shoulder rotation torque and passive glenohumeral rotation ROM were examined in 15 male subjects (27.5 ± 5.5 yrs; all current or former members of the German National Team) and comparisons of dominant to non-dominant body sides were conducted. Maximum strength (work) during external shoulder rotation was higher on the dominant body side compared with the non-dominant body side (8.4 ± 8.4 %; p < 0.01). No side-to-side differences were found in maximum internal rotation strength. Internal rotation ROM and total ROM were smaller on the dominant body side (21 ± 18 %; p < 0.01 and 5 ± 9 %; p < 0.05). Our findings indicate similar adaptation patterns of shoulder rotation mobility compared to other overhead sports, but differing results regarding shoulder rotation strength. Stretching exercises and monitoring programs are recommended for elite Ultimate Frisbee players, starting at the early stages of the career. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This study compared the effects of performing different unilateral combined training interventions on diverse vertical and horizontal jumping performance parameters, change of direction, concentric and eccentric mean power, and their associated inter-limb asymmetries in young soccer players. Methods: Forty-seven young male soccer players (age: 15.5 ± 0.9 years) were distributed into three groups. Two groups performed the same training volume with both legs, beginning with the weaker leg (Stronger Volume Weaker leg group (SVW), n = 14) or with the stronger leg (Stronger Volume Stronger leg group, (SVS), n = 15). The third group executed double the volume with the weaker leg and also commenced with such leg (Double Volume Weaker leg group (DVW), n = 16) during a 10-week period. Pre-and post-intervention tests included a single-leg hop, single-leg lateral hop, triple hop, bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps, a change of direction speed test, concentric and eccentric mean power during the lateral squat test, and their corresponding asymmetries. Results: Single-leg hop weaker leg, triple hop weaker leg, and bilateral countermovement jump improvements were achieved in the SVW (ES: 0.29 to 0.46) and DVW (ES: 0.55 to 0.73) groups. Between-groups analysis showed better results in single-leg hop in the SVW and DVW compared to group SVS. The DVW group achieved better improvements in countermovement jump in comparison to groups SVS and SVW. Conclusions: Groups that started with the weaker leg seemed to achieve a greater volume of significant changes than when starting with the stronger leg. Performing a double volume on the weaker limb does not guarantee further improved performance compared to other groups. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Sleeve as a protection device that is used around a bridge pier in the laboratory. The sleeve is an axisymmetric, open-ended pipe-like cylindrical enclosure placed concentric to the circular bridge pier. The underlying scour reduction mechanism with the sleeve is to confine the scouring vortex in annular space amid the pier and sleeve. Experiments were carried out on four sizes of sleeves at different vertical locations. After experimentation, it was concluded that as the diameter of the sleeve is smaller than performance potential of the sleeve becomes higher. The sleeve may be able to reduce scour by 56% with reference to an unprotected circular bridge pier. This axisymmetric device is sufficient for huge changes at the angle of flow attack and also workable during floods. Hence, this device provides a scour-free arrangement. © 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group®.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments can provide tight environment-phenotype matching. However, the prerequisite is a reliable environmental cue(s) that enables organisms to use current environmental information to induce the development of a phenotype with high fitness in a forthcoming environment. Here, we quantify predictability in the timing of precipitation and temperature change to examine how this is associated with seasonal polyphenism in tropical Mycalesina butterflies. Seasonal precipitation in the tropics typically results in distinct selective environments, the wet and dry seasons, and changes in temperature can be a major environmental cue. We sampled communities of Mycalesina butterflies from two seasonal locations and one aseasonal location. Quantifying environmental predictability using wavelet analysis and Colwell's indices confirmed a strong periodicity of precipitation over a 12-month period at both seasonal locations compared to the aseasonal one. However, temperature seasonality and periodicity differed between the two seasonal locations. We further show that: (a) most females from both seasonal locations synchronize their reproduction with the seasons by breeding in the wet season but arresting reproduction in the dry season. In contrast, all species breed throughout the year in the aseasonal location and (b) species from the seasonal locations, but not those from the aseasonal location, exhibited polyphenism in wing pattern traits (eyespot size). We conclude that seasonal precipitation and its predictability are primary factors shaping the evolution of polyphenism in Mycalesina butterflies, and populations or species secondarily evolve local adaptations for cue use that depend on the local variation in the environment. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - When designing a wind or solar plant collection system, it is important to verify that the cable conductors and concentric neutrals can withstand the worst-case short circuit event during the life of the project. Existing standards provide equations for calculating the withstand capabilities of these conductors. However, these standards provide no guidance on what current value should be used in these equations. It will be shown that two commonly used methods are inaccurate, with one being overly conservative, and one being insufficient. An accurate method of determining the correct current value will be presented. The impacts to the cable sizing of two representative projects will be explored for all three methods. It will be shown that the accurate method prevents unnecessary cable up-sizing compared to the overly conservative method but causes additional cable up-sizing compared to the insufficient method. To conclude this paper, it is suggested that the new method be incorporated into the relevant standards to provide clarity to practicing engineers and to ensure that cables are properly sized in any underground cable installation. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing process to build 3D objects on a horizontal plane from bottom to top. In the conventional FDM process, the printing of curved objects causes the staircase effect and results in poor surface finish. In this work, the FDM process integrated with a 6-DOF Industrial robot is used to print the curved objects by generating non-linear tool paths to avoid the staircase effect. A standard NACA 0015 aircraft wing having curved surfaces is printed without staircase effect at a uniform deposition rate using an industrial robot. The wing is sliced into concentric curved layers either in the form of convex or a concave shape. A new methodology is developed by combining the non-linear toolpaths with the change in extruder orientation to print curved objects at a uniform deposition without any staircase effect. ABB Robotstudio simulation software is used for simulating the printing process and simulation results are validated by printing the portion of the wing using the Industrial robot with an FDM extruder as an end effector. The experimental results showed that the aircraft wing is printed successfully with uniform deposition at constant velocity without any staircase effect. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

AB  - During the past 20 years, more than 1,600 species of well-preserved fossil insects, including members of over 270 families within 24 orders, have been described from the Middle Jurassic Yanliao Entomofauna and Early Cretaceous Jehol Entomofauna in Northeastern China. Diversified fossil insects not only document the origin, systematics, and early evolution of many lineages, but also reveal these lineages behaviors and interactions with coexisting plants, vertebrates, and other insects in their ecosystems. Fossil evidence has been documented, for example, regarding insects feeding and pollination mutualism with gymnosperms; ectoparasitic feeding on blood of vertebrates; camouflage, mimicry of gymnosperm plants, and eyespot warning; sound stridulation for attracting potential mates; and sexual display, mating, egg-laying, and parental care. In this article, we review the diverse taxonomy of mid-Mesozoic insects of Northeastern China and elucidate their behaviors and interactions within their ecosystems, which have impacted their early evolution and development into extant insects.  © 2021 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Waking from a vivid dream, the sage finds himself lost between worlds of possibility and ultimately transformed. Zhuangzi's famous butterfly story may seem familiar, but the text-linguistic structures of its broader interpretive context are little discussed and poorly understood. In this paper I argue that the Qíwùlùn chapter, like so many other ancient writings, is composed in a concentric, chiastic pattern, with sections in each half mirroring each other throughout, while the central sections provide a pivotal peak and interpretive key that radiate meaning back out to the margins. To quote Mary Douglas, "the meaning is in the middle."The middle is also the place of Peircean Thirdness. In this paper I map the chapter's text-level chiastic structures and trace its intimations of Peircean semiotic pragmatism. The core rings of the text endorse contrite fallibilism while also prefiguring triadic structure, the pragmatic maxim, and the continuity thesis. Referencing cultural and historical contexts plus recent scholarship on Zhuangzi and Peirce, I ultimately argue that this ancient text, like the pragmatist semiotic it foreshadows, can be better appreciated and applied by embracing the interplay of centers and margins, discarding debilitating ideologies, and waking up to new degrees of freedom.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.

AB  - Eyespots on the wings of different nymphalid butterflies have become valued models in eco-evo-devo. They are ecologically significant, evolutionarily diverse, and developmentally tractable. Their study has provided valuable insight about the genetic and developmental basis of inter-specific diversity and intra-specific variation, as well as into other key themes in evo-evo-devo: evolutionary novelty, developmental constraints, and phenotypic plasticity. Here we provide an overview of eco-evo-devo studies of butterfly eyespots, highlighting previous reviews, and focusing on both the most recent advances and the open questions expected to be solved in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is an adolescent hip disorder characterized by displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis relative to the metaphysis. The aim of treatment is to stabilize the proximal epiphysis, avoid further displacement and prevent femoral head osteonecrosis. Open reduction and internal fixation is often required to treat chronic and severe SCFE, typically using a Modified Dunn procedure. This allows anterior access to the proximal femur, epiphyseal mobilization and metaphyseal debridement of cervical callus. Debriding the cervical callus concentrically to allow accurate relocation of the epiphysis on the metaphysis can be challenging. This article describes the benefits of using the Oxford Spherical Mill from a partial knee replacement system to assist with metaphyseal debridement during open epiphyseal reduction and internal fixation for SCFE. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - The incidence of Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is increasing and at least 20% do not return to preinjury activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate biomechanical differences between those assigned to a Fear group and No-Fear group based on fear of reinjury during activity after ATR, by evaluating a drop countermovement jump. Twenty-five participants were evaluated 23.5 months after ATR. Peak values for eccentric and concentric joint power were identified for ankles, knees, and hips. Participants were assigned to Fear group or No-Fear group depending on their answers to a question regarding fear of reinjury during activities. Interlimb peak power was compared between groups for landing and push-off with a mixed model ANOVA. Compared to the No-fear group, the Fear group presented significant decreased power in the ankle (P <.001) but increased power in the knee (P <.001) in involved limb during both phases. A 3-way interaction was found between group, side, and phase for frontal plane hip power (P <.001). Our findings indicate that those who are afraid of reinjury demonstrate higher interlimb differences compared to those who are not. They also compensate for ankle deficits with greater knee and hip power. © 2021 The Authors. Translational Sports Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - An annulus is, informally, a ring-shaped region, often described by two concentric circles. The maximum-width empty annulus problem asks to find an annulus of a certain shape with the maximum possible width that avoids a given set of n points in the plane. This problem can also be interpreted as the problem of finding an optimal location of a ring-shaped obnoxious facility among the input points. In this paper, we study square and rectangular variants of the maximum-width empty annulus problem, and present first nontrivial algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms run in O(n3) and O(n2log⁡n) time for computing a maximum-width empty axis-parallel square and rectangular annulus, respectively. Both algorithms use only O(n) space. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reports a novel diaphragm-assisted open-ended hollow coaxial cable resonator (OE-HCCR) for highly sensitive pressure measurements at elevated temperatures. The coaxial line resonator is constructed using two highly reflective reflectors in a homemade hollow coaxial cable, including a metal post shorting the two concentric conductors (i.e., the inner conductor and the outer conductor) and the open end of the coaxial line. In the pressure sensor device design, a sealed metal diaphragm is mounted on the open end of the OE-HCCR and is employed as the pressure responsive element. The diaphragm's deflection can be accurately captured by the coaxial line resonator in real-time, in response to a change in differential pressure. The sensor device's responses to hydraulic pressures at ambient temperature and air pressures at elevated temperatures up to 1000 °C were investigated in the demonstration experiments, showing user-configurable measurement sensitivity and high-temperature survivability. The device's pressure measurement resolution is also demonstrated as high as sub-Pascal by probing tiny hydrostatic pressure changes. A positive feedback loop is constructed as an alternative interrogator for the novel device, showing high signal quality and ease of demodulation. The pressure sensor described in this work is robust, easy-to-manufacture, user-configurable, low-cost, highly sensitive, and has great potential for industrial applications involving high-temperature and harsh environments. The presented work opens new avenues to develop a new generation of high-sensitivity and high-temperature microwave sensors based on well-known open-ended coaxial probes. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Professional rugby player's shoulder injuries are common, often related to high-intensity trauma. Their prevention by an isokinetic evaluation is an integral part of the physical preparation of the players. Profiles of shoulder internal and external rotator (IR and ER) muscles are established, but do not consider the player's on-field position. Our goal was to establish an isokinetic profile for shoulder external and internal rotator muscles in rugby players depending on their on-field position: forwards or backs. Materials: Forty-two professional rugby players were tested during a rugby season. We used an isokinetic Con–Trex® dynamometer to measure internal and external rotation of the shoulder. Data were obtained successively in concentric contraction mode at 60°/s and 240°/s, then in eccentric contraction mode at 60°/s. Peak torque (PT), peak torque normalized to body weight (PT/BW) of the IR and ER muscles and the ratio of ER PT/IR PT (ER/IR ratio) were measured for each angular velocity. Results: Significant differences of PT (Nm) between forwards and backs were found in the dominant side for all tested velocities (P < 0.05). There were no statistical differences between groups in PT/BW (P > 0.05), ER/IR ratio (p > 0.05) and mixed ratio (P = 0.54). Conclusion: Despite significant differences in the absolute values of isokinetic strength, there are no significant differences in shoulder strength normalized to body weight between forwards and backs. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - For a number of applications, it is essential to design fibers that exhibit nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion. Moreover, the nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion fiber should ensure the single mode operation to avoid the multimode dispersion as it is responsible for signal degradation. In order to control the nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion and single-mode regime, the present paper describes a new controlling technique of a dual concentric core fiber (DCCF). The finite element method (FEM) is used to investigate the properties. By introducing a varying index profile (alpha) in the core region of the DCCF, we can successfully design a single-mode operation fiber with nearly zero ultra-flattened chromatic dispersion in linear or nonlinear application. Other important guiding characteristics such effective mode area (Aeff), effective nonlinear refractive index (n2) are also discussed. The proposed DCCFs can be applicable in digital optical communication (dense wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems, for long-haul telecommunications networks and super continuum generation (SCG)). © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The genus, Pupulanella, Adamski and Nishida, n. gen. is proposed, and synapomorphies are given as supportive evidence. All life stages of P. gemma Adamski and Nishida, n. sp. (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea: Depressariidae) are described, and observations of its natural history are provided. The eggs are saddle-shaped, with several rows of shallow, parallel, and alternating longitudinal ridges and furrows, each contiguous with a transverse crest on opposing polar ends that are steeply sloped. Each egg is laid singly on the underside of leaves along the veins, and occasionally on stems or leaf petioles of the host plant, Rivina humilis L. (Petiveriaceae). The first instar and early second instar live within a weblike silken tunnel on the undersurface of leaves along the leaf veins while later instars construct and live within a partially-rolled shelter along the outer margin the leaf. Pupation occurs within a dried leaf fold in litter on the ground. The pupa is covered with short hairs, is deeply excavated between the labrum and the proximal margins of the maxillae, and possesses a ridgelike structure (= cocoon cutter) on the dorsolateral area of the prothorax. Adult moths exhibit an unusual survival behavior in microlepidoptera, by resting conspicuously on the upper surfaces of leaves exposing a "false head" and eye-spot patterned on the apical part of the forewings, on each side of the posterior end of the insect. Additionally, the terminal portions of the antennae and hindlegs extend well beyond the posterior wing margins contributing to a more realistic headlike mimic. Males and females are crepuscular, exhibiting short distance flights among host plants.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the interest of inertial measurement units (IMU) in the functional assessment of the ankle to identify sport specific adaptations and to determine whether a hilly run session affected balance control and ability in accelerating eversion and slowing down inversion movements. Thirteen well-trained trail runners and 12 cyclists completed ankle tests on a destabilized footwear device: one balance-control test and two dynamic inversion and eversion tests (involving eccentric, ECC and concentric, CONC muscle regimens, respectively). Kinematic data derived from IMU were automatically calculated as performance scores i) to compare trail runners and cyclists at rest, and ii) to determine the fatigue induced by hilly run (16 km, 400 D+) in trail runners. Both ECC and CONC scores derived from angular velocity of twenty repetitions (with threshold of 60°/s and 250°/s, respectively) during dynamic tests. Results showed higher ECC score (CV = 14.6%; p = 0.06; ES = moderate) and lower CONC score (CV = -33.8%; p < 0.01; ES = large) in trail runners than in cyclists. Furthermore, proprioception score decreased in response to the hilly run session (CV = -6.1%; p = 0.03; ES = moderate). Kinematic data emphasized sport specific adaptations in the ability to control eversion and inversion movements. This might suggest differences in evertor muscle strength characteristics. Decrement in the proprioception score highlighted the interest of using IMU in the assessment of acute fatigue induced by hilly run.  © 2021 ACAPS.; L'objectif de cette étude était de tester l'intérêt d'une centrale inertielle dans l'évaluation fonctionnelle de la cheville pour : 1) identifier les adaptations spécifiques liées à la discipline sportive et 2) analyser l'effet d'une course de type trail sur le contrôle postural et la capacité à accélérer le mouvement d'eversion et à ralentir l'inversion de la cheville. La stabilité de la cheville a été évaluée chez 13 coureurs de type trail et 12 cyclistes à partir d'un chausson déstabilisant équipé d'une centrale inertielle : un test de contrôle de l'équilibre et deux tests dynamiques d'inversion et d'éversion (sollicitant respectivement les régimes de contraction musculaire, ECC et concentrique, CONC). Les données cinématiques étaient calculées automatiquement et exprimées sous forme de score de performance. En situation de repos, les scores des coureurs de trail étaient comparés à ceux des cyclistes. De plus, les spécialistes de trail réalisaient les tests avant et après une course (16 km, 400 D+) pour rendre compte de la fatigue accumulée. Les scores ECC et CONC étaient déterminés par les valeurs de vitesse angulaire lors de 20 répétitions (seuil de 60°/s et de 250°/s, respectivement). Les résultats montraient des scores ECC supérieurs (CV=14,6%; p=0,06 ; taille d'effet=modéré) et des scores CONC inférieurs (CV=-33,8%; p<0,01; taille d'effet=large) pour les coureurs de trail comparés aux cyclistes. Des altérations proprioceptives étaient constatées après la course de trail (CV=-6,1%; p=0,03; taille d'effet=modéré). Les mesures inertielles ont montré certaines caractéristiques cinématiques spécifiques à une pratique sportive régulière suggérant une adaptation musculaire. La diminution des scores de proprioception en réponse à une course de type trail souligne l'intérêt des mesures inertielles dans l'estimation de la fatigue aiguë. © 2021 ACAPS. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

AB  - Previous studies have found that Carolina chickadees and tufted titmice use a predator’s head orientation to determine risk, taking fewer seeds from a feeder if an avian predator model’s head is facing the feeder while ignoring the head orientation. In addition to head orientation, eyes are a cue of predator risk. In the current study, I examined whether or not chickadees and titmice used the presence of eyes of a predator model to determine when to forage for food. Plastic owl models, with their eyes covered or uncovered, were presented to wild flocks of chickadees and titmice. To test whether or not chickadees and titmice would respond to the presence of eyes, the number of seeds taken and the calling behavior of birds were compared between the two types of predator presentations (eyes covered or uncovered). Chickadees and titmice took fewer seeds when the eyes were uncovered than when they were covered. Chickadees also gave significantly more introductory notes, often used in association with the presence of predators or risk, in their calls when the eyes were visible than when the eyes of the predator model were covered. The results indicate that chickadees and titmice can use the presence of eyes on predators to determine predation risk and possibly use eye gaze to determine where a predator is looking. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A new fossil leaf mine ichnogenus and species, Leucopteropsa spiralae gen. et sp. nov. (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), from the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation (Campanian age, c. 76.6 to 74.5 Ma) in Utah, USA, is the earliest record (75.6 ± 0.18 Ma) and only fossil evidence of a lyonetiid-like leaf-mining moth, as well as one of the oldest known fossils within the Yponomeutoidea-Gracillarioidea clade. The blotch-style mine consists of a central oviposition, or egg laying, site with a spiral trail packed with faecal pellets that concentrically spirals outwards. The trail increases in width from oviposition site to terminus, the trajectory of the trail does not cross itself, and there is no apparent pupation chamber present. The morphology of the fossil mine is reliably associated with Cemiostominae and is most similar to mines produced by extant members of the genus Leucoptera, such as the mountain ash bent-wing moth, Leucoptera malifoliella, and the laburnum leaf miner L. laburnella. The leaf-mining moth responsible for L. spiralae may be an early member of the genus Leucoptera or other Cemiostominae genera, and the new ichnogenus Leucopteropsa is erected because the morphology, and therefore the taxonomy, of the moth specifically responsible for L. spiralae mines was not preserved in association with the leaf mine. Despite the phylogenetic analysis of 15 lyonetiids undertaken in this study and the need for further phylogenetic work for the Lepidoptera, particularly the placement of the family Lyonetiidae and the subfamily Cemiostominae within the larger Yponomeutoidea-Gracillarioidea phylogeny, this fossil provides an important Late Cretaceous (∼76 Ma) calibration point for lepidopteran phylogeny and serves as an indicator for the antiquity of the most diverse lepidopteran group, Ditrysia. Because lepidopteran body fossils are extremely rare, owing to their small and lightly sclerotized bodies, this discovery also underscores the importance of ichnofossils in the lepidopteran fossil record. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:52B20B15-5C1A-4916-9096-A490DFED7D1C. © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2021.

AB  - Many avian species are considered agricultural pests and cause severe and costly damage to crops worldwide. Crop producers use several methods to reduce damage by birds, with frightening devices serving among the most popular approaches. Biologically salient frightening devices, such as broadcast of conspecific alarm calls or placing predator models in fields, are considered particularly effective because they can trigger antipredator behaviors that reduce foraging activities or abundances of target birds locally. However, it remains unclear which type of biologically salient frightening device is most effective and whether some work best against certain bird species or on certain types of crops. We reviewed the published scientific literature to fill in these knowledge gaps about using biologically salient frightening devices for crop protection against avian pests. We found 48 experiments evaluating the impact(s) of biologically salient frightening devices. However, only 28 experiments statistically tested their results from which to draw conclusions. We found that alarm call playbacks, eye-spot balloons, or automated flying vehicles (UAVs) reduced avian abundance in all experiments. All experiments using alarm call playbacks, eye-spot balloons, hawk-kites, or UAVs effectively reduced crop damage. However, only experiments on passerine birds and in row crops were well-represented in these studies. We discuss potential biases in the literature that may limit our understanding of how birds respond to biologically salient frightening devices and suggest future directions that researchers might take to fill knowledge gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main aim of this chapter is to review the role of strength training in reducing the risk of sports injuries, which are a major concern in any sport. As strength training has been recognized as one of the best strategies to minimize the risk of injury, we will focus on the current evidence-based information and how we can directly apply this to our practices. This chapter will also explain an alternative neuromuscular training approach based on dynamic correspondence, using the most common actions players employ throughout a soccer game (our examples are taken from soccer but can be extrapolated to other sports). Traditionally, soccer players train by lifting weights bilaterally in the vertical axis, focused on the concentric phase of the movement and with no making-decision actions. However, it is helpful to train several force-vectors (three-dimensional movements) applying force unilaterally (instead of bilaterally) with emphasis on the eccentric phase, and including stochastic or unexpected situations to mimic real game situations. After reviewing the theoretical concepts, a practical viewpoint is presented, allowing coaches and trainers to adapt their practices to the specific requirements of their sport. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The field of global urban studies has witnessed a “peripheral” turn since the 1990s, first led by the Los Angeles School of urban geographers, with a more diverse group of urban scholars who study the global South following. Challenging the city-centric view, as exemplified by the Chicago School's concentric model of urban growth, these scholars train their lens on urban peripheries, such as suburbs, small towns, and the sprawling hinterlands outside metropolitan regions. This essay discusses what can be gained from shifting the analytical lens from the city center to the periphery, and from Western cities to cities in the global South. Drawing upon the new scholarship on urban peripheries in India, it also identifies three major avenues for further investigation-the comparative method, center-periphery relations, and ways of life. © 2021 South Asia Multidisciplinary Academic Journal.

AB  - Rotor assembly is a core process in aero-engine manufacturing. In rotor assembly, preventing out-of-tolerance of concentricity is the primary problem needed to be solved. Traditional methods for the problem are based on manual test with the dial indicator, which depends on experience appraises and lacks a systematic and quantitative structural precision design theory. In this paper, revolving characteristics and multistage assembly characteristics of rotors are discussed. A three dimensional deviation modeling method based on the improved Jacobian-Torsor theory and a concentricity control strategy are proposed. A revolution joint is introduced to represent the revolving characteristics of aero-engine rotors. Then the extended Jacobian matrix is derived and thus a correction of the original J-T model is completed. The concentricity variation propagation function of multistage rotor stacking is further determined, and the control equation for concentricity is derived. Based on the model, a four-stage rotor assembly is verified. The best concentricity is 0.042 mm when the optimal installation angles are 3.513 rad, 5.206 rad, and 0.953 rad. The results show that the model can effectively predict the overall precision and determine the optimal assembly plan, and has strong significance in engineering practice. © 2021, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

AB  - This work proposes the use of 2D Lattice Flower Constellations (2D-LFCs) to facilitate the design of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) slotting system to avoid collisions between compliant satellites and to optimize the available orbital volume. Specifically, this manuscript proposes the use of concentric orbital shells of admissible “slots” with stacked intersecting orbits that preserve a minimum separation distance between satellites at all times. The problem is formulated in mathematical terms and three approaches are explored: random constellations, single 2D-LFCs, and unions of 2D-LFCs. Each approach is evaluated in terms of several metrics including capacity, Earth coverage, orbits per shell, and symmetries. Additionally, a rough estimate for the capacity of LEO is generated, subject to certain minimum separation and station-keeping assumptions, and several trade-offs are identified to guide policy-makers interested in the adoption of a LEO slotting scheme for space traffic management. © 2020 COSPAR

AB  - Turbulent flames with compositionally inhomogeneous mixtures are common in many combustion systems. Turbulent jet flames with a circular nozzle burner were used earlier to study the impact of inhomogeneous mixtures, and these studies showed that the nozzle radius affects the flame stability. Accordingly, planar turbulent flames with inhomogeneous turbulent jet are created in a concentric flow slot burner (CFSB) to avoid this effect in the present study. The stability characteristics, the mixing field structure, and the flame front structure were measured, and the correlations between stability and the mixing field structure were investigated. The mixture fraction field was measured in non-reacting jets at the nozzle exit using highly resolved Rayleigh scattering technique, and the flame front was measured in some selected turbulent flames using high-speed Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of OH technique. The data show strong correlations between flame stability and the range of mixture fraction fluctuations. The flames are highly stabilized within a mixing field environment with the range of fluctuation in mixture fraction close to the range of the flammability limits. The mixing field structure is also illustrated and discussed using a mixing regime diagram and showed that the scatter of the data of the different cases is consistent with the classified mixing regimes. Lean flames are stabilized in the current slot burner. The flame front structure topology varies consistently from thin, small curvature at the low level of turbulence and higher equivalence ratio to more wrinkled, larger curvature, but a thicker structure at a higher level of turbulence and lower equivalence ratio. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Antifloating anchors are widely used during the construction of slab foundations to prevent uplift. However, existing methods for calculating the critical length of these anchors have limited capabilities and therefore require further research. As the mechanisms which govern the displacement and stability of antifloating anchors are closely related to those of piles subject to uplift, a simplified anchor model has been developed based on existing concentric thin-walled cylinder shear transfer models used for pile design. Analytical expressions for the critical length of the steel bar and GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) antifloating anchors in rock are derived accordingly before demonstrating the validity of the method through engineering examples. The research results show that when the length of an antifloating anchor is less than a critical length, shear slip failure occurs between the anchor and surrounding material due to excessive shear stress. When the length of an anchor approaches the critical length, the shear stress gradually decreases to the undisturbed state. If the anchor length is larger than the critical length, the uplift loads are safely transferred to the ground without causing failure. The ratio of elastic modulus between the anchor and rock mass was found to be positively correlated with the critical anchoring length. Because the elastic modulus of GFRP bars is lower than that of steel bars, the critical anchoring length of GFRP bars is greater than that of steel bars under the same anchor-to-rock modulus ratio (Ea/Es). The results show that the proposed calculation method for the critical length of antifloating anchors appears valid and could provide a theoretical basis for the design of antifloating anchors after further refinement.  © 2021 Nan Yan et al.

AB  - Developmental plasticity can match organismal phenotypes to ecological conditions, helping populations to deal with the environmental heterogeneity of alternating seasons. In contrast to natural situations, experimental studies of plasticity often use environmental conditions that are held constant during development. To explore potential interactions between day and night temperatures, we tested effects of circadian temperature fluctuations on thermally plastic traits in a seasonally plastic butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. Comparing phenotypes for four treatments corresponding to a full-factorial analysis of cooler and warmer temperatures, we found evidence of significant interaction effects between day and night temperatures. We then focused on comparing phenotypes between individuals reared under two types of temperature fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and individuals reared under a constant temperature of the same daily mean. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), and different types of dominance-like effects, with one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) having a larger impact on phenotype. Differences between thermally plastic traits, which together underlie alternative seasonal strategies for survival and reproduction, revealed their independent responses to temperature. This study underscores the value of studying how organisms integrate complex environmental information toward a complete understanding of natural phenotypic variation and of the impact of environmental change thereon. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Underground stone mines in the United States generally use room-and-pillar mining method, and designing stable pillars, and knowing their behavior through the mine's life is of vital importance to avoid hazardous conditions. In the USA, empirical pillar strength equation and S-Pillar program developed by Esterhuizen et al., (2011) are used to assess the global stability of stone mines. This study shows the derivation of the empirical pillar strength equation to obtain the stress gradient equation as a function of pillar width-to-height ratio. This function provides the stress distribution within the pillar and it was used to derive concentric rings of zones to simulate stone mine pillar yielding in boundary element software. © 2021 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association

AB  - We theoretically propose Si based concentric tubes meta material absorber, comprised from consecutive concentric tubes of intrinsic Si and doped Si (D-Si) layers. Our proposed structure exhibits broadband performance within the mid IR wavelength range extending from 3 to 7 μm with an absorption more than 0.89 in case of S-polarized incident light. The proposed design reveals new avenues to realize Si/D-Si concentric tubes metamaterial absorber for mid IR photo detection and mid IR thermal harvesting applications.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Although isokinetic strength testing is commonly used in hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation and prevention, research findings concerning its predictive value remain inconclusive. Existing research focuses on peak torque (PT) and angle of PT, not analysing the torque behaviour throughout the testing range of motion (ROM). This study intended to assess the value of isokinetic curve evaluation in association with HSI. A sample of 116 male football players with and without a recent HSI history was submitted to bilateral isokinetic assessment of the knee and hip muscles. Raw isokinetic data were filtered and normalized prior to curve analysis submission in MATLAB. Torque development of each muscle group throughout the entire testing ROM was assessed using HSI history as an independent variable. Curve analysis revealed significant differences in torque behaviour in function of injury history. Players with an HSI history demonstrated significantly stronger concentric knee flexion and extension, eccentric knee extension and concentric hip extension patterns compared to the controls and their uninjured limb. HSI history was also associated with lower concentric hip flexion torques and lower mixed H:Q ratios compared to the control group and their contralateral limb. HSI history was associated with altered knee and hip muscle strength profiles, potentially due to isolated focus on local strength training in rehabilitation or mechanisms of neuromuscular inhibition. Because the differences in torque amplitude were range-dependent and did not systematically concur with the point of PT achievement, isokinetic strength evaluation should most probably be conducted using curve analysis. © 2020 European College of Sport Science.

AB  - Modulation using a higher sided polygonal space vector structure (SVS) is an elegant method to increase the linear modulation range and to eliminate the undesired lower order harmonics from motor phase voltage. This article presents the generation of a dense 15-concentric 30-sided multilevel SVS using a single dc-link for an open end induction motor (OEIM) drive. The proposed scheme eliminates lower order harmonics till 25th order from motor phase voltage throughout the modulation range. The $dv/dt$ stress in the phase voltage applied to the motor will also be highly reduced owing to the multilevel structure. The pulsewidth modulation scheme employed utilizes the denseness of SVS and avoids iterative searches to find the triangle, which encompasses the tip of reference voltage vector, which are typical in multilevel polygonal SVS. The topology consists of an active dc-link fed three-level primary inverter and a capacitor fed five-level secondary inverter connected to either end of an OEIM. The primary inverter acts as the active power supplier for the drive and the secondary inverter filters out the undesirable lower order harmonics from motor phase voltage. The proposed scheme is experientially validated and the results are included in this article.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Lateral restrainers are traditionally provided in reinforced masonry (RM) walls to prevent the vertical steel bars from buckling. In the current version of the Australian Masonry Standards (AS 3700–2018), the use of lateral restrainers in RM walls is relaxed, if the vertical rebars are surrounded by grout annulus of twice the diameter of the bars. However, it is challenging to maintain the verticality of the reinforcing bars in the block cores to satisfy the grout annulus requirement without lateral restrainers. To address this challenge, restrainer bar chairs can be used in the construction of RM walls which are easier to employ in comparison to lateral restrainer ties. However, the implications of adopting restrainer bar chairs as an alternative to restrainer ties in RM wall construction are not well verified. In this study, the influence of restrainer bar chairs and conventional lateral ties restraining methods on the axial compression and out-of-plane bending characteristics of RM walls have been investigated. In total, twelve RM walls of dimensions 1390 mm height × 590 mm length × 190 mm thickness were constructed and tested, of which, four walls each were tested under concentric and eccentric compression and four-point bending. The experimental results revealed that the performance of RM walls with restrainer bar chairs and conventional lateral ties were similar, in terms of the observed failure modes, strength, load–displacement characteristics obtained under both compression and out-of-plane loading conditions. Strain measurements on rebars indicated that a composite action was ensued in both restrainer configurations. The capacities of the RM walls under compression and out-of-plane bending were also verified with three different masonry standards provisions and were found adequate with reasonable safety. Overall, it can be concluded that the restrainer bar chairs can effectively be used in RM walls to enable quick and accurate vertical positioning of the rebars and ensure adequate grout annulus around them. © 2021 Institution of Structural Engineers

AB  - Abstract: The variability of morphological traits (the shape and size of the forewing and the location, number, and diameter of eyespots in the submarginal band of the wing pattern) was studied and analyzed in two species of Satyridae, Aphantopus hyperantus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Erebia ligea (Linnaeus, 1758), occurring sympatrically in Sverdlovsk Province, the Urals. It was originally supposed that micropopulations of the univoltine generalist species A. hyperantus would be weakly isolated and phenotypically homogeneous, since their habitats were positioned a small distance apart (about 10 km) within the same forested area and connected by a network of roads and glades serving as potential dispersal corridors; in contrast, micropopulations of the bicyclic specialist species E. ligea would be more strongly isolated and, accordingly, would have a higher level of phenotypic differentiation. The variability of morphological traits was analyzed by phenetic methods and also by traditional and geometric morphometrics. In both species, significant differences between micropopulations were found in the wing shape and size, as well as in the location and stability of eyespots in the wing pattern. As expected, temporal and spatial isolation of the micropopulations has led to differentiation in E. ligea. At the same time, the initial hypothesis of homogeneity of the A. hyperantus population in the studied territory was not confirmed. The latter case demonstrates that spatial isolation may be sufficient for differentiation in a species that is significantly sedentary and does not fully use the existing dispersal corridors. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the injury prevention program FIFA 11+ (level 2) application, on lower limb balance ability and strength, as an effective approach of reducing injury risk in male soccer players. Thirty-two players were randomly divided into two groups (N = 16 each), one control group (CON group), and one training group (INT group). The INT group followed the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The CON group continued the usual warm-up. Biodex Stability System was used to assess balance ability in both groups at baseline and after the completion of FIFA 11+ program. Additional isokinetic knee joint moment measurements (concentric flexors/extensors and eccentric flexors) performed at two different angular velocities, first at 60°/s and then at 180°/s. Statistical significant differences were found, after the completion of the FIFA 11+ training program, in stability index (total and anterior – posterior) (p <.05), in concentric and eccentric flexors strength (p <.05) and conventional H/Q ratio (p <.05). Application of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program for 8 weeks can improve lower limbs balance ability and hamstrings muscle strength, elements which are very important for prevention of hamstring muscle strains and lower limb ligament injuries in soccer. © JPES.

AB  - Electoral geographical research into urban territories shows a distinction in voting behaviour between a city centre and its surroundings. A recent exploratory study of the electoral geography of Prague found that distance from the city centre was the variable that best explained the spatial variation of votes, which might follow a concentric pattern and, thus, it recommended seeking a theoretical explanation in urban sociology, e.g. in the Burgess model of the city. Following this recommendation, I compared spatial patterns of voting behaviour in two cities – Warsaw and Prague. Using component analysis, I reduced the number of analysed variables to one for each city representing the main spatial polarisation. In Prague, voting behaviour showed a distinction between the city centre, inner suburbs and outer suburbs. While the city centre and the outer suburbs were conservative, the inner suburbs tended to vote for the left. This partially follows the Burgess model. On the other hand, the electoral geography of Warsaw showed a different structure. In this article I pre-sent a way of visualising urban electoral data in maps that avoid distortion caused by varying polygon size. © 2020, Sociologicky Ustav SAV / Institute for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - For staring infrared imaging warning equipment, both wide field of view(FOV)surveillance and accurate target detection are urgently demanded. To meet this requirement, we designed an infrared zoom surveillance system based on concentric spherical lens in this study. It consists of a multi-layer concentric spherical lens and an array of independent continuous zoom cameras. With the spherical lens, a wide FOV is achievable benefiting from its structure. The small camera array enables imaging the target scene into sub-regions. And with the continuous zoom ability, the camera array makes it possible for simultaneous wide FOV surveillance and target identification. When potential targets are detected, further determination and identification can be made by zooming in the corresponding camera to provide high-resolution images. Results show that the modulation transfer function(MTF)curves of the infrared imaging system in the full zoom range are close to the diffraction limit. The zoom curve is smooth avoiding the occurrence of jamming, impact and other adverse phenomena in the zoom process. It provides feasible solution for large field monitoring and high-resolution target identification. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Trunk kinematic variables have been used to understand the risk of low back injuries in the workplace. Variability in the trunk kinematics as an individual performs a repetitive lifting task is an underexplored area of research. In the current study, it was hypothesized that workplace variables (starting height of lift and load weight) would have an impact on the variance in the kinematic and kinetic variables. Twenty participants performed 60 repetitions of an asymmetric lifting task under four different conditions representing two levels of load weight (5% or 10% of the participant's body weight) and two levels of starting height (80% or 120% of the participant's knee height). The Lumbar Motion Monitor was used to capture trunk kinematic variables from the concentric range of lifting motion while ground reaction forces were collected using a force platform. The primary dependent variables were the variance of kinematic and kinetic variables across these 60 repetitions. The results showed a significant effect of starting height on the variance of sagittal plane trunk kinematics with the lower starting height generating an increased variance (sagittal range of motion increased by 55%, average sagittal velocity increased by 95%, peak sagittal velocity increased by 105%, and peak sagittal acceleration increased by 130%). There was no consistent significant main effect of either independent variable on the variance of the transverse plane kinematics. Additionally, there was no significant effect of load weight on the variance of any trunk kinematic variables tested. In terms of ground reaction forces, it was shown that the starting height of the load had a significant effect on the variance of peak vertical ground reaction force, while the weight of the load had a significant effect on the variance of the peak shear force. Relevance to industry: A relationship between trunk kinematics and risk of injury has been previously demonstrated. Investigating the variability of these trunk kinematics parameters in a repetitive lifting task and its relation with workplace parameters can provide an understanding of how changing workplace parameters may affect the risk of low back problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plasticity is often regarded as a derived adaptation to help organisms survive in variable but predictable environments, however, we currently lack a rigorous, mechanistic examination of how plasticity evolves in a large comparative framework. Here, we show that phenotypic plasticity in eyespot size in response to environmental temperature observed in Bicyclus anynana satyrid butterflies is a complex derived adaptation of this lineage. By reconstructing the evolution of known physiological and molecular components of eyespot size plasticity in a comparative framework, we showed that 20E titer plasticity in response to temperature is a pre-adaptation shared by all butterfly species examined, whereas expression of EcR in eyespot centers, and eyespot sensitivity to 20E, are both derived traits found only in a subset of species with eyespots. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

AB  - A new species of Ophthalmoblysis Scoble, 1995 from Mexico is described and illustrated: O. ibarrai Garzón-Orduña, sp.n. The species is known only from Los Tuxtlas (Veracruz, Mexico), and is distinguished by the shape and pattern of the hindwing eyespot. Unlike the eyespot of other species in Ophthalmoblysis, that of O. ibarrai has a smaller and not fully circular inner black disc. In addition, O. ibarrai can be distinguished from a similar, undescribed species from Costa Rica by the presence of a sclerotized extension at the tip of the male valva and by the shape of the cornutus in the vesica. Ophthalmoblysis ibarrai represents the northernmost member of the genus. Copyright © 2019 Magnolia Press.

AB  - This study investigated additional and traditional variables from isokinetic test of thigh muscles in soccer players across different field positions. One hundred and eighty-nine athletes performed maximal concentric isokinetic knee contractions on dominant (DL) and non-dominant limb (NDL) at 60º/s and 240º/s. The additional outcomes peak torque angle (AngPT), acceleration time (AcT) and time to peak torque (TPT) and traditional outcomes Peak torque (PT), total work (TW) and power (Pw) were extracted from the exam. Goalkeepers (GK), side backs (SB), central backs (CB), central defender midfielders (CDM), central attacking midfielders (CAM) and forwards (FW) were considered. Comparisons between limbs and positions demonstrated that SB extensors of the DL presented TPT lower (p = 0.006) and AngPT higher (p = 0.011) than NDL at 60°/s. CDM extensors of the DL showed lower TPT at 60°/s (p = 0.003) and 240°/s (p = 0.024). CAM flexors of the DL showed lower TPT (p = 0.026) and AcT (p = 0.021) at 240°/s than NDL. CB, CDM and CAM extensors of the NDL showed higher PT, TW and Pw than DL (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there are muscle imbalances between limbs in SB, CDM and CAM and across different field positions. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The dispersion capacity is fundamental to establish a biological control program with parasitoids. This information is used to determine the efficiency and the number of release points. Thus, the objective of this work was to determine the dispersion and to estimate the number of release points of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), in sweet corn, cucumber and cabbage in the Ceará State. The experiments were carried out in areas of maize with four leaf pairs (V4) and eight leaves pair (V8), stacked and cabbage. Unviable eggs of an alternative host were distributed in concentric circles of radius 2.5; 5.0; 9.0 and 12.0 m. Mean dispersal distance in the V4 stage maize was 4.7 m with a dispersion area of 48.6 m2, parasitism index of 18.4%, requiring 206 points/ha. In the V8 stage maize, the mean distance was 5.9 m, dispersion area of 60.3 m², mean parasitism index of 22.7% and 166 release points/ha. For the cucumber culture the mean distance was 6.0 m, dispersion area 62.2 m², mean parasitism index of 21.1% and 161 release points/ha. For cabbage the mean distance was 5.6 m, dispersion area of 56.8 m², mean parasitism index of 22.1% and 176 release points/ ha. © 2020, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to find a suitable intercropping model for alpine tea plantations and explore the effects of different intercropping crops on the occurrence of major leaf diseases in tea plantations, field experiments were performed to identify the main types of leaf diseases in tea plantations in northwest Sichuan. Through the investigation and study of the disease occurrence in tea-soybean, tea-maize, tea-plum, tea-Magnolia officinalis intercropping gardens and pure tea garden, the leaf disease occurrences in different tea gardens were compared and analyzed. The results show that the main diseases of tea plantations in northwest Sichuan were tea blister blight, tea anthracnose, tea brown blight, tea bird’s eye spot and tea red leaf spot. Among the four intercropped crops, soybean and maize were the ideal intercropped crops. The lowest incidences of tea blister blight and tea anthracnose were found in the tea-soybean intercropping system. Compared with the control, the incidences of tea blister blight and tea anthracnose decreased by 85.12% and 74.34%, respectively. The incidence of anthracnose in tea-maize intercropping system was reduced by 49.76% compared with the control. However, the average incidence of tea blister blight and anthracnose in tea-Magnolia officinalis intercropping garden were 27.82% and 51.67%, which were 10.50 and 1.73 times higher than those in the pure tea garden. The soybean and the maize could replace Magnolia officinalis as an ideal intercropping crop in alpine tea garden. Intercropping soybean could significantly reduce the occurrence of diseases and thereby losses. © 2019 Journal of Tea Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of Rhizoctonia cerealis resistant strains to control wheat sharp eyespot in pig manure developed organic fertilizer were investigated. Organic fertilizer was produced in a self-built aerated static composting box (0.37 m3) and later assessed using values of temperature, moisture, pH, C/N ratio, nitrogen transformation, fluvic- and humic acid composition and germination index. Together, these assessments indicated that disposed pig manure could be considered as a non-hazardous fertilizer. By adding R. cerealis resistant strains (Bacillus flexus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis and Paenibacillus sp.), we were successfully able to develop wheat sharp eyespot inhibiting bio-organic fertilizer. Our results showed that soil applied with 10 t/hm2 of the developed bio-organic fertilizer significantly improved the dry weight of the wheat, promoted chlorophylls and soluble protein composition and effectively prevented the wheat from sharp eyespot. The protection rate (77.1%) of our developed bio-organic fertilizer is 42.3% higher than the tested commercially available organic fertilizer (34.8%), and the disease index is significantly lower (P < 0.001) than both the control and commercial organic fertilizer. In conclusion, the prevention and control effects of our developed bio-organic fertilizer on wheat sharp eyespot were both significant and promising. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim:The association between prehypertension (pre-HTN) and abnormal left ventricular (LV) geometric patterns is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of echocardiographic studies aimed to provide a new piece of information on LV geometric alterations in untreated pre-HTN individuals.Design:Studies were identified by crossing the following search terms: 'prehypertension,' 'high normal blood pressure,' 'heart,' 'LV hypertrophy' (LVH), 'LV geometry,' 'LV mass,' and 'echocardiography.'Results:A total 60 949 participants (38 536 normotensive, 14 453 pre-HTN, and 7960 HTN individuals) were included in six studies. LV concentric remodelling was the most common abnormal pattern in pre-HTN participants followed by eccentric and concentric LVH. Compared with normotensive group, pre-HTN exhibited a higher risk of LV concentric remodelling (OR 1.89, CI 1.70-2.10, P < 0.001), eccentric LVH (OR 1.65, CI 1.40-1.90, P < 0.001) and concentric LVH (OR 2.09, CI 1.50-3.00, P < 0.001). The likelihood of having abnormal LV patterns in HTN was significantly higher (P < 0.001 for all) than in pre-HTN participants.Conclusion:Our meta-analysis shows that alterations in LV geometry in pre-HTN individuals are intermediate between normotensive and HTN individuals. These findings suggest that pre-HTN is associated to early changes in LV structure and geometry, and preventive strategies may have a protective impact on development of subclinical cardiac damage in this setting. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Off highways vehicles especially tractors are prone to operate on fields where tractors are exposed to dry crops, chaffs (the husks of corn or other seed separated by winnowing or threshing) and particles which can catch fire easily when it is exposed to surface/skin temperature of more than 200 degree Celsius. It will be a basic projection that tractor will be having vertical exhaust tube at a height but there are certain tractors and applications where exhaust pipe must be below certain height, and which will be close to the ground. In these scenarios the skin temperature of exposed exhaust tail pipe part must be within a limit and that must be within the existing design. Break firing point of chaffs and husk also experimented at different moisture level. Several options are being verified on different heat flow and geometry changes, additional air entry jet nozzle with double pipe arrangement. In first option additional stream of fresh air from atmosphere will be directed to cool the exhaust temperature at an entry point at entry of an exhaust pipe to reduce the skin temperature. The effect of heat transfer interaction between fresh air and exhaust gas stream will be studied. Secondly optimizing the air gap between the two concentric pipes to maintain the exhaust skin temperature as a skin concept and the effect of air gap between the pipe and what gap must be maintained to keep the skin temperature in control. Thirdly a heat resistant packed material in between the inner and outer pipe as third concept. Three options were made and there was an analysis matrix to determine which can better suit the application on all aspects and its inferences will be made as a detailed paper. © 2020SAE International.

AB  - Background: The FIFA 11+ has shown to increase muscle strength and reduce injury risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players. Methods: Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 ± 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 ± 5.1 years). The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus). Results: No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences. At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb. No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time. Conclusions: Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players. However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios. . © 2019, © 2019 European College of Sport Science.

AB  - Pressure drop in a radial flow reactor occurs when process flow crosses the packed catalyst bed installed between the two concentric perforated screens during operation. This pressure drop generates the lateral bed stress against the reactor's perforated screens to shift. The pressure drop will further grow as catalyst attrition increases in production. For an outward radial flow, the pressure drop may exert higher stresses to the outer screen as the packed bed is pushed toward it. An extreme case is when the entire catalyst bed could be pinned to the outer screen of the reactor by enough pressure drop. This could cause the internal components to be overly stressed on the excessive bed load, for which the components might not have been designed adequately. Predicting how radial pressure drop impacts the bed stress and shifts the load distribution is important in preventing mechanical failure during operation. In this study, an analytical model is derived based on Janssen's theory, a classical semi-empirical granular solid material model, to examine a generic packed catalyst bed in an outward radical flow reactor. A modification to Janssen's theory is introduced to include pressure drop in order to explore its effects on bed stress and load. The critical condition is derived. Copyright © 2020 ASME.

AB  - Colour pattern has served as an important phenotype in understanding the process of natural selection, particularly in brightly coloured and variable species like butterflies. However, different selective forces operate on aspects of colour pattern, for example by favouring warning colours in eyespots or alternatively favoring investment in thermoregulatory properties of melanin. Additionally, genetic drift influences colour phenotypes, especially in populations undergoing population size change. Here, we investigated the relative roles of genetic drift and ecological selection in generating the phenotypic diversity of the butterfly Parnassius clodius. Genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism data show that P. clodius forms three population clusters, which experienced a period of population expansion following the last glacial maximum and have since remained relatively stable in size. After correcting for relatedness, morphological variation is best explained by climatic predictor variables, suggesting ecological selection generates trait variability. Solar radiation and precipitation are both negatively correlated with increasing total melanin in both sexes, supporting a thermoregulatory function of melanin. Similarly, wing size traits are significantly larger in warmer habitats for both sexes, supporting a Converse Bergmann Rule pattern. Bright red coloration is negatively correlated with temperature seasonality and solar radiation in males, and weakly associated with insectivorous avian predators in univariate models, providing mixed evidence that selection is linked to warning coloration and predator avoidance. Together, these results suggest that elements of butterfly wing phenotypes respond independently to different sources of selection and that thermoregulation is an important driver of phenotypic differentiation in Parnassian butterflies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Response and recovery are the two most crucial aspects associated with post disaster management. Both these operations need real-time data and location at which the event occurs. These operations require event-based collection of data at critical times. The events may occur at any place and the data may be needed from either or all of the events for strategic planning and event handling. It is a challenging task to process the events whose locations are uncertain. In this view, there is a need to know the real-time location of events occurring in the surrounding. Moreover, there is a possibility of huge amount of signal processing among the devices deployed in the terrain. In this context, an event localization algorithm is proposed based on the Direction of Arrival estimation technique in the Internet of Things environment. It estimates the location of events by mapping the deployed devices using concentric circular array in the region. Further, the Cramer-Rao bound for the proposed algorithm is derived and compared with the existing schemes for efficacy. The algorithm is implemented on real test bed and presented with comparative evaluation to validate the work. © 2019 The British Computer Society 2019. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eyespots are wing color pattern elements repeatedly observed in many butterflies, whose developmental genetics has been extensively documented. Nevertheless, the evolutionary forces shaping their diversification across species still remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the evolution of eyespots in the 30 species of the neotropical genus Morpho. Morpho butterflies display a series of eyespots located on the ventral side of their wings, highly variable among species, ranging from large, conspicuous structures to vestigial spots. Applying geometric morphometrics to a large sample (N = 910) spanning all Morpho species and both sexes, we assess eyespot number, position, size, and shape. We detect a divergence in eyespot position between understory and canopy species, with an L-shaped configuration in canopy species and a line pattern in understory species, where the eyespots tend to fuse and form a stripe in white and pale species. This effect is stronger than expected based on a Brownian motion model of phylogenetic divergence, suggesting an adaptation to the microhabitat and an influence of the wing color on the evolution of pattern elements. Remarkably, this shift in color pattern is strongly correlated with a shift in wing shape. However, using a thin-plate spline interpolation, we show that the shape change is insufficient to explain the evolution of eyespot position as a developmental side effect of wing shape evolution, also pointing at an adaptive effect. Finally, we find a significant negative correlation between eyespot relative size and the within-species variation in eyespot number, position, size, and shape, suggesting a relaxed or apostatic selection on small eyespots (rare phenotypes being favored as they are less likely to be remembered and thus detected by predators). We hypothesize that contrasted ecology may explain the observed differences between species: large and phenotypically stable eyespots might act as attack deflectors, small, variable faded eyespots might rather enhance crypsis, and pale species stripe pattern might disrupt the outline of the wing. © Copyright © 2020 Debat, Chazot, Jarosson, Blandin and Llaurens.

AB  - For the purpose of backlash adjusting in different power flow branches of the concentric split-torque system, which affect the distribution of the load between the input pinons or the idlers, a new kind of face gear drive mating with a tapered involute pinion is investigated. The profile modified tooth surface of the tapered involute pinion and the face gear is derived. The limiting conditions of the face gear is determined. Tooth contact analysis (TCA) and stress analysis are performed in order to evaluate the performance of the presented face gear drive. The results show that: the half cone angle of the face gear drive should be controlled with the tooth strength of the gear into consideration. The face gear drive is less sensitive to the misalignments. The edge contact can be avoided with a profile modified pinion or a profile modified face gear. Furthermore, the backlash adjusting is achieved by the axial movement of the pinion. And it has little influence on the tooth contact pattern of the face gear drive. This kind of face gear drive can be applied to the situations where the backlash adjusting is required, such as the concentric split-torque system. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - In a wireless network, multiple channels can increase network capacity. However, it causes other problems, e.g., multi-channel hidden terminal problem and the issue about how to allocate channels to wireless nodes. Basically, a well-defined channel assignment can avoid radio interference and improve transmission performance. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a multiple channel assignment scheme, called concentric-hexagon-oriented multichannel assignment (CHOMA for short), in which all deployed eNBs are organized as concentric-hexagon (C-hexa for short). Available channels are grouped and then allocated to the C-hexas. We also arrange channels allocated to a C-hexa so as to reduce radio interference among its eNBs, consequentially improving the transmission capability and performance of a wireless network. Experimental results show that the CHOMA is really an interference-free scheme, no matter whether the target system is a network with SISO, SIMO, MISO or MIMO stations.

AB  - We develop a framework that creates a new polygonal mesh representation of the sparse infill domain of a layer-by-layer 3D printing job. We guarantee the existence of a single, continuous tool path covering each connected piece of the domain in every layer in this graphical model. We also present a tool path algorithm that traverses each such continuous tool path with no crossovers. The key construction at the heart of our framework is a novel Euler transformation which converts a 2-dimensional cell complex K into a new 2-complex Kˆ such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton Gˆ of Kˆ has even degree. Hence Gˆ is Eulerian, and an Eulerian tour can be followed to print all edges in a continuous fashion without stops. We start with a mesh K of the union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. First we compute its Euler transformation Kˆ. In the slicing step, we clip Kˆ at each layer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler. We then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes created by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra support edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges without support in the next layer above. These support edges maintain the Euler nature of the complex. Finally, we describe a tree-based search algorithm that builds the continuous tool path by traversing “concentric” cycles in the Euler complex. Our algorithm produces a tool path that avoids material collisions and crossovers, and can be printed in a continuous fashion irrespective of complex geometry or topology of the domain (e.g., holes). We implement our test our framework on several 3D objects. Apart from standard geometric shapes including a nonconvex star, we demonstrate the framework on the Stanford bunny. Several intermediate layers in the bunny have multiple components as well as complicated geometries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Manufacturing errors are always unavoidable in actual machines. In external gear machines (EGMs), some of the manufacturing errors are typically on the same scale as the nominal clearances between the internal parts. These clearances are responsible for leakage flows that reduce the volumetric efficiency of EGMs and impact their overall performance. Current approaches of modeling the operation of EGMs neglect the manufacturing errors which limits their accuracy. This paper proposes a technique to study the operation of EGMs accounting for two common gear manufacturing errors: conicity and concentricity. Furthermore, an alternate technique to model these errors is proposed by defining an “effective gap height”. This latter technique can be used in any existing lumped parameter model as well as for quick estimations. To validate the approach, experiments are performed with gearsets exhibiting varying amounts of conicity and concentricity errors. The results from both the simulations and the experiments show that the volumetric efficiency decreases with an increase of the conicity error. Instead, by increasing the concentricity error, an increase in the volumetric efficiency is found, at least until the conditions of contact between the gears and the casing's internal surface are avoided. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Muscle strength imbalances between the internal and external rotators of the shoulder are frequent in swimmers, but their role in shoulder injury remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of shoulder rotator strength and injury in elite adolescent swimmers. Eighteen adolescent swimmers performed preseason isokinetic tests of the internal and external rotator muscles in concentric (con) and eccentric (ecc) modes. Conventional (conER:conIR and eccER:eccIR) and functional ratios (eccER:conIR and eccIR:conER) were calculated. Thirteen swimmers completed a weekly questionnaire about swimming habits and shoulder injuries throughout the season. Preseason testing showed a significant negative association between the functional eccER:conIR ratio and years of practice (p < 0.05). Over the season, 46% of athletes experienced at least one shoulder injury. At the end of the season, peak torques increased for both internal and external rotator muscles strength, but only concentrically, resulting in a decrease in the eccER:conIR functional ratio (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis highlighted good predictive power for the preseason functional eccER:conIR ratio, as values below 0.68 were associated with a 4.5-fold (95% CI 1.33-15.28, p < 0.05) increased risk of shoulder injuries during the season.  © 2020 Joffrey Drigny, Antoine Gauthier, Emmanuel Reboursière, Henri Guermont, Vincent Gremeaux, Pascal Edouard, published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - Concentric tube robots, composed of nested pre-curved tubes, have the potential to perform minimally invasive surgery at difficult-to-reach sites in the human body. In order to plan motions that safely perform surgeries in constrained spaces that require avoiding sensitive structures, the ability to accurately estimate the entire shape of the robot is needed. Many state-of-the-art physics-based shape models are unable to account for complex physical phenomena and subsequently are less accurate than is required for safe surgery. In this work, we present a learned model that can estimate the entire shape of a concentric tube robot. The learned model is based on a deep neural network that is trained using a mixture of simulated and physical data. We evaluate multiple network architectures and demonstrate the model's ability to compute the full shape of a concentric tube robot with high accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This special issue addresses both the changes and the continuities that have marked the recent evolution of anthropological research on the circum-Mediterranean peoples. The authors demonstrate how a growing self-consciousness of the region's people as ‘Mediterranean’ produces new configurations, including official (government) but also nostalgic (local) deployments of an allegedly traditional set of supposedly Mediterranean values, including those glossed from the early days of Mediterraneanist anthropology as ‘honor’ and ‘shame.’ The region illustrates cultural and linguistic lability, helping to move anthropology toward a more flexible understanding of regional as well as national forms of belonging and of their frequent if partial convergence. In this larger cultural theatre, moreover, we can discern more clearly the artificiality of national borders, a condition that warns against returning to the concentric reification of a ‘Mediterranean culture area’ that was so prominent in an earlier era of scholarship and allows us to understand how and why the impulse to reify the Mediterranean as a self-evident category took such a powerful hold in both the anthropology of the 1960s and does so, in instructively different ways, in the geo-politics of today. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Resistance training is often recommended for combined increases in traditional and alternative hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) ratios in order to reduce knee strength imbalance and associated hamstrings and knee ligament injury risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different concentric and eccentric resistance training programs on traditional and alternative H:Q ratios. Forty male volunteers were assigned to one of 4 groups: concentric quadriceps and concentric hamstrings (CON/CON, n = 10), eccentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstrings (ECC/ECC, n = 10), concentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstrings (CON/ECC, n = 10), or no training (control (CNTRL), n = 10). Traditional conventional (CR) and functional (FR), alternative rate of torque development (RTD), muscle size (MS), and muscle activation (MA) H:Q ratios were measured before and after six weeks of unilateral nondominant knee extension–flexion resistance training performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. The ECC/ECC training significantly increased FR (pre = 0.75 ± 0.11; post = 0.85 ± 0.15), whereas the lack of training (CNTRL) decreased the RTD H:Q ratio (pre = 1.10 ± 0.67; post = 0.73 ± 0.33). There were no differences between groups for the other traditional and alternative ratios following resistance training protocols. These findings suggest eccentric exercise for quadriceps and hamstrings as the most beneficial training program for inducing increases in the traditional FR. However, different resistance training strategies may be needed to also elicit increases in the alternative RTD, MS, and MA H:Q ratios for fully restoring muscle balance and reducing potential hamstrings and knee ligament injury risk. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Compared with the mesh-based numerical calculation method, the meshless methods avoid the problems caused by geometric topology, nodal numbering and information transmission of discrete meshes or nodes, which shows significant advantages in solving the problems of complex computing domain boundaries, phase transformation, interface tracking, and crack propagation. Based on the moving least squares approximation and variational principles, a two-dimensional element-free Galerkin (EFG) model for heat transfer/solidification behavior of continuous casting round billets is derived and established in this work. Taking the measured heat flux as the boundary conditions, the non-uniform solidification behavior of the round billet is calculated and analyzed. The essential issues that affect the suitability and calculation accuracy of the meshless model are discussed, such as the nodal arrangement and the size of the supporting domain. The "concentric circle" nodal arrangement scheme in rectangular coordinate system is proposed, and the results show this scheme can conveniently deal with the problem of curve boundary and the solidified shell movement of round billet, showing great flexibility in node arrangement. When the supporting domain size is adopted to be 1.7 times of the average nodal spacing, the calculation accuracy is high under the regular and random nodal arrangement schemes. The results verify the feasibility and accuracy of EFG meshless model in the calculation of non-uniform heat transfer and solidification of billet. It shows a significant advantage in the phase transformation interface tracking, and provides a theoretical foundation for subsequent research on thermo-mechanical coupling and crack prediction analysis. © 2020, Science Press.

AB  - In order to reduce the usage amount of pesticide fertilizers and protect the natural environment, seed coating agents are receiving increased wide concern. In this study, the active constituent (pesticide) and inactive components (surfactants and film former) of the seed coating agents were screened and optimized by the wet sand processing superfine grinding method. The fungal inhibition test of pesticides showed that thifluzamide, fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin, and difenoconazole have an obvious fungal inhibitory effect on wheat sharp eyespot, take-all, and root rot. LAE-9 and polyacrylamide + carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is recommended for the safe surfactant and film former, respectively, based on the seed germination test. Moreover, 6% difenoconazole · fludioxonil flowable concentrate for seed coating (FSC) stimulates the seedling growth of wheat, advances the growth of root, and improves biomass in the field trial, meanwhile, the control efficiency reached above 80%. Thus, we suggested it can be used as an effective seed coating agent for the control of soil-borne diseases in wheat. The seed coating agent has the characteristics of disease prevention, increasing crop yield, and safety of environment, which is of significance in practical application. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Mystical literature and spirituality from 16th-century Spain engage religious images from the three most prominent religions of al-Andalus-Christianity, Islam, and Judaism: among others, the dark night, the seven concentric castles, the gazelle, the bird, the sefirot’s encircled iggulim or towering yosher, the sacred fountain, ruins, and gardens. Until the 20th-century, however, scholarship read these works mostly as “Spanish” mysticism, alienated from its Andalusı roots. This comparative study deploys theological, historical, and textual analysis to dwell in one of these roots: the figure of the garden’s vital element, water, as represented in the works of Teresa de Jesús and Ibn ‘Arabi. The well-irrigated life written by these mystics underscores the significance of this element as a path to life, knowledge, and love of and by God. Bringing together scholarship on Christian and Sufi mysticism, and underscoring the centrality of movement, flow, and circulation, this article pieces together otherwise disparate readings of both the individual work of these two figures and their belonging in a canon of Andalusı/Spanish mysticism. The weaving of these threads will offer readers a different understanding of early modern religion, alongside traditional readings of Spain’s mystical literature and its place in the global context. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A comprehensive evaluation of knee muscle strength, knee hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H/Q) force ratio, and symmetry of both knee joints is beneficial to preventing knee joint injuries. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dominant and non-dominant side isokinetic characteristics of the knee joints of Chinese calisthenics athletes and bilateral symmetry of muscle strength. METHODS: Knee joints of 22 Chinese calisthenics athletes (aerobics group, n=8; athletics group, n=14) from Chinese national aerobics team were measured using IsoMed2000 at 60 and 180 (°)/s concentric angular speed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The peak torque (PT) and the relative peak torque (PT/BW) of the flexors and extensors of the knee joint in the two groups were significantly decreased with the increase of the angular speed (P < 0.001), and the H/Q ratio significantly increased with the increase of the angular speed (P < 0.001). The dominant leg flexors strength were significantly higher than that of the non-dominant leg (P < 0.05), and extensors strength and H/Q of the dominant leg were significantly higher than those of the non-dominant leg at the speed of 60 (°)/s (P < 0.05). The H/Q of the non-dominant knee joint in the aerobic group was significantly higher than that in the athletics group at the speed of 180 (°)/s (P < 0.05). In the aerobic group, the flexor peak torque of the dominant leg was significantly higher than that of the non-dominant leg at the speed of 60 (°)/s and 180 (°)/s (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in both side of extensors. In the athletics group, the flexor peak torque of the dominant leg was significantly higher than that of the non-dominant leg (P < 0.05), the extensors peak torque [60 (°)/s], PT/BW [60 (°)/s] and H/Q [180 (°)/s] of the dominant leg were significantly higher than those of the non-dominant leg (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that the muscle force of the dominant and non-dominant knee joints were asymmetric, and the athletes ought to improve the muscle power of the non-dominant knee joint. A lower H/Q indicates imbalance between the flexor and extensor strength of the knee joint, and it is necessary to strengthen the knee flexor strength training, especially the training for fast strength. © 2020, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - The paper presents an oil well completion integrating multilaterals, intelligent completions, permanent downhole monitoring systems, electric submersible pump (ESP) and a horizontal wellhead system. The reliability of the completion was improved by using a concentric tubing system that avoided the use of a downhole wet connect tool to disconnect the intelligent completion control lines during ESP workovers. The concentric production tubing design enabled the separation of the intelligent completion from the ESP tubing. The intelligent completion was installed as a first run with a big bore 7 inch tubing in the upper section. The ESP was later installed inside the 7 inch tubing as a second trip. This separation between the intelligent completion and the ESP production tubing enables ESP workover without disturbing the control lines of the intelligent completion. Each of the technologies used in this well are well- established in the industry and have extensive track record but industry survey indicate that the case presented in this paper is the world's first completion integrating all this technology in a single installation. This unique and challenging integration was required to meet well requirements and to build field experiences for future applications in more challenging environments that require ESPs and intelligent completions. The paper discusses the drivers for this integrated completion, completion design, individual equipment, preparation, field experience during installation and the performance of the system during production. Three simulated cases of inflow optimization are presented to show the capability of intelligent completion to monitor and optimize inflow without well intervention. The paper also presents details of the special compact horizontal wellhead that integrated the multiple tubing hangers and wellhead spools while maintaining the overall height of the wellhead. The completion has been successfully installed and the lessons are being applied in designing future installations. Copyright 2020, International Petroleum Technology Conference.

AB  - We present a modified TacTip biomimetic optical tactile sensor design which demonstrates the ability to induce and detect incipient slip, as confirmed by recording the movement of markers on the sensor's external surface. Incipient slip is defined as slippage of part, but not all, of the contact surface between the sensor and object. The addition of ridges - which mimic the friction ridges in the human fingertip - in a concentric ring pattern allowed for localised shear deformation to occur on the sensor surface for a significant duration prior to the onset of gross slip. By detecting incipient slip we were able to predict when several differently shaped objects were at risk of falling and prevent them from doing so. Detecting incipient slip is useful because a corrective action can be taken before slippage occurs across the entire contact area thus minimising the risk of objects been dropped. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last decades, terroristic attacks have caused human tragedies and loss of human life and materials and had negative impact on the economy and the development of the world. There have been over 48,000 terrorist incidents from 2000 to 2014 claiming over 107,000 lives according to the Global Terrorism Index GTI. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a system to proactively detect and predict any potential threats that can be caused by terrorist attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of things (IoT), and cloud technology can be integrated to prevent terroristic attacks. In this paper, I propose a novel framework called 'We See You' (WSY). WSY is a complete comprehensive system framework which proposed to prevent and reduce the terroristic attacks by predicting any instance of terrorist attack. The prediction is based on monitoring the ongoing psychological and social behaviors, some important physiological signs and other markers, using IoT devices. Physiological signs related to the terrorist attacks include the blood concentration in the face, the eyes spotting, the gait, the hair and hair shaving, the face expressions, and the weight. The other personal markers include the clothes, the speech, the speech stress emotion, and the smell. The prediction is based on the analysis of previous individual terrorist's profile (built from News, law enforcement records, etc.), and previous recording cases of video and audio of terrorist incidents. To the best of my knowledge, this framework system is the first framework that proposed to predict and identify the terrorist timely before the implementation of the suicide incidents, through the psychological and social behaviors, speech, some important physiological signs and other markers. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, nonmetallic materials, which are resilient to corrosion, low cost, and lightweight, have been exploited in many industrial sectors such as oil and gas field. A common application of them is in the form of pipes. Despite the advantages, these pipes can be damaged by delamination, defects, holes, and erosion, which may lead to major production failures or even environmental catastrophes. To prevent these issues, nondestructive testing (NDT) of these pipes is required to replace these components in a timely manner. Due to the fact that the traditional NDT methods are mostly effective for metallic pipes, microwave holographic imaging is proposed for inspection of multiple concentric nonmetallic pipes. Besides, standardized minimum norm (SMN) is used to mitigate the depth biasing problem in the proposed imaging technique. To reduce the complexity of the imaging system, we aim at using the narrowest possible frequency band using an array of receiver antennas. The performance of the proposed NDT method is validated through simulation and experimental data in two scenarios including the antennas placed outside the pipes and inside the pipes. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The relationship between data can be visualized by using multiple types of images, so it is convenient for users to obtain information and relationships between data. However, when many data items, attributes and links, and the relationships between data are not clear, a visual view which is capable of relationship mining is required. For the real task requirements of domain data analysis, elements such as circle layout and node link layout were used to display simple relationships and hierarchical structures between data. What's more, combining concentric circle layout, scatter plots, thermogram elements and dynamic filtering and data clustering techniques, a relational mining view was proposed that not only demonstrated the nature of data nodes, but also revealed the potential relationships between data. Finally, combining the above views, a visual analysis graph of the mining data relationship was presented, which was ExploreView. It was applied to the sampling data set of the Food and Drug Administration, while using cube metaphor to organize data. The bipartite graph defined task requirements before completing visual coding. It can display the basic situation of data information and dynamically interact according to the actual needs of users, and reflect the attributes, various hierarchical structures and relationships between data. As a result, the visual analysis graph was easy and efficient to operate. It can be used to provide early warning for possible food safety incidents, locate key regulatory targets, which provided reference for the development of rules, and effectively met the needs of different types of users. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - This article presents a model predictive controller (MPC) developed for the autonomous steering of concentric tube robots (CTRs). State-of-the-art CTR control relies on differential kinematics developed by local linearization of the CTRs mechanics model and cannot explicitly handle constraints on robot's joint limits or unstable configurations commonly known as snapping points. The proposed nonlinear MPC explicitly considers constraints on the robot configuration space (i.e., joint limits) and the robot's workspace (i.e., mixed boundary conditions on robot curvature). Additionally, the MPC calculates control decisions by optimizing the model-based predictions of future robot configurations. This way, it avoids configurations it cannot recover from, i.e., joint limits, singular configurations, and snapping. The proposed controller is evaluated via simulations and experimental studies with a variety of trajectories of increasing complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of MPC to avoid singularities while satisfying robot mechanical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution enables following of trajectories unattainable by state-of-the-art controllers with mean error corresponding to 1% of robot arclength. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Viruses are incomplete elements that require other organisms to survive and multiply, hence constantly mutate during its evolution, resulting from adaptations in response to environmental changes such as the immune response of the host. In this line, they are responsible for many diseases, but today, there is evidence that viruses have many benefits and even have a unique ecosystem to control the different species or strain of themselves. While highlighting the benefits of some viruses and the undesirable effects of their eradication, the present review expresses the idea of the viral ecosystem and its importance, which has been supported in several studies. There are countless articles about virus-related illnesses and the undesirable effects of therapeutic interventions in eliminating the less pathogenic viruses or manipulating viral ecosystems. By simulating the viral ecosystem with an ecosystem found among the snakes, it can be assumed that the viruses have concentric zones, which its inner zone includes the most dangerous viruses for humans and each zone is surrounded and controlled by an outer zone of less dangerous viruses for humans. The outermost zone consists of viruses that are least dangerous to humans such as common cold that protect humans and possibly other living organisms against more dangerous viruses in inner zone, causing the activation of immune system by playing a unique and pivotal role in the ecosystems. Therefore, manipulating the ecosystem and disrupting the balance might have epidemics and harmful consequences for the plants, animals, and human. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Eyespots evolved independently in many taxa as anti-predator signals. There remains debate regarding whether eyespots function as diversion targets, predator mimics, conspicuous startling signals, deceptive detection, or a combination. Although eye patterns and gaze modify human behaviour, anti-predator eyespots do not occur naturally in contemporary mammals. Here we show that eyespots painted on cattle rumps were associated with reduced attacks by ambush carnivores (lions and leopards). Cattle painted with eyespots were significantly more likely to survive than were cross-marked and unmarked cattle, despite all treatment groups being similarly exposed to predation risk. While higher survival of eyespot-painted cattle supports the detection hypothesis, increased survival of cross-marked cattle suggests an effect of novel and conspicuous marks more generally. To our knowledge, this is the first time eyespots have been shown to deter large mammalian predators. Applying artificial marks to high-value livestock may therefore represent a cost-effective tool to reduce livestock predation. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Small marginal eyespots on lepidopteran wings are conspicuous elements that attract a predator's attention to deflect attacks away from the body, but the role of ultraviolet (UV) reflectivity at the center of these patterns and variation in eyespot number in altering the function of eyespots remains unclear. Here, we performed a field-based predation experiment with artificial prey items based on the appearance of squinting bush brown butterflies Bicyclus anynana (Butler, 1879). We tested how two visual properties of the wing pattern affect predation risk: i) the number of eyespots on the ventral forewing surface-two or four; and ii) the UV reflectivity of eyespot centers-normal (where the UV reflectivity of the centers contrasts strongly with that of the darker surrounding ring) or blocked (where this contrast is reduced). In total, 807 prey items were deployed at two sites. We found a significant interaction between the number of ventral forewing eyespots and UV reflectivity in the eyespot centers: in items with fewer eyespots, blocking UV resulted in increased predation risk whereas in items with more eyespots, blocking UV resulted in decreased predation risk. If higher predation of paper models can be equated with higher levels of wing margin/eyespot conspicuity, these results demonstrate that UV reflectivity is an important factor in making eyespots more conspicuous to predators and suggest that the fitness of particular butterfly eyespot number variants may depend on the presence or absence of UV in their centers and on the ability of local predator guilds to detect UV. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Compared with mesh-based numerical approaches, the meshless methods avoid complex topology and transmission of nodal information, which shows remarkable advantages in solving the problems of phase-transition interface tracking, curved boundary and crack propagation. In this paper, the discrete governing equations of heat transfer/solidification for the round billet are deduced and constructed based on Element-free Galerkin method. Using the measured non-uniform heat flux to impose the Neumann boundary conditions, a 2D cross-section computational model is developed to simulate and investigate the non-uniform solidification behavior of round billet. In the computational model, the essential issues such as time discretization scheme, time step length, nodal arrangement and their effects on the simulation accuracy as well as stability are specified. To verify the influence and flexibility of node layout in the meshless method model, the present work explores a concentric circular nodal arrangement scheme and determines a reasonable range of nodal spacing. The result has revealed that the meshless method could be employed successfully in exploring the non-uniform solidification behavior of continuous casting billet, which provides a foundation for further research on thermo-mechanical and cracks propagation analysis. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.

AB  - Károlyi, Pach, and Tóth proved that every 2-edge-colored straight-line drawing of the complete graph contains a monochromatic plane spanning tree. It is open if this statement generalizes to other classes of drawings, specifically, to simple drawings of the complete graph. These are drawings where edges are represented by Jordan arcs, any two of which intersect at most once. We present two partial results towards such a generalization. First, we show that the statement holds for cylindrical simple drawings. (In a cylindrical drawing, all vertices are placed on two concentric circles and no edge crosses either circle.) Second, we introduce a relaxation of the problem in which the graph is k-edge-colored, and the target structure must be hypochromatic, that is, avoid (at least) one color class. In this setting, we show that every ⌈ (n+ 5 ) / 6 ⌉ -edge-colored monotone simple drawing of Kn contains a hypochromatic plane spanning tree. (In a monotone drawing, every edge is represented as an x-monotone curve.) © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, the interface effect is firstly found in X-ray images of compound insulator. In order to eliminate the interface effect, this paper have carried out its related research. Firstly, based on the X-ray attenuation characteristics, a concentric multi-layer material model is established, and the conditions for the interface effect of X-ray penetration of the concentric multilayer material are theoretically analyzed. Then, X-DR (X-ray with Director Digital Panel Radiography) experiments verify the existence of interface effect of X-ray penetration, and the experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. Finally, the computed tomography (CT) detection technology is adopted to eliminate this interface effect of X-ray penetration in this paper. The experimental results show that the system with CT detection can eliminate the interface effect of X-ray penetration. The system is beneficial for the inspectors to make correct fault detection on the equipment and avoid the consequences of false detection. This study provides an available NDT detection method for concentric multi-layer material structure equipment. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Aims: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of sophorolipids on several fungal and oomycete plant pathogens and the relationship between sophorolipids at different pH and antimicrobial activities. Methods and Results: Sophorolipids had different solubility at different pH with a dramatic increase in solubility when pH was 6 or higher. Inhibition of mycelial growth of Phytophthora infestans by sophorolipids was affected by pH values, showing that when the pH value was higher, the inhibition rate was lower. Sophorolipids inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of several fungal and oomycete pathogens in vitro including Fusarium sp., F. oxysporum, F. concentricum, Pythium ultimum, Pyricularia oryzae, Rhizoctorzia solani, Alternaria kikuchiana, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici and P. infestans and caused morphological changes in hyphae by microscope observation. Sophorolipids reduced β-1,3-glucanase activity in mycelia of P. infestans. In greenhouse studies, foliar application of sophorolipids at 3 mg ml−1 reduced severity of late blight of potato caused by P. infestans significantly. Conclusion: Sophorolipids influenced spore germination and hyphal tip growth of several plant pathogens and pH solubility of sophorolipids had an effect on their efficacy. Application of sophorolipids reduced late blight disease on potato under greenhouse conditions. Significance and Impact of the Study: The findings indicated that sophorolipids have the potential to be developed as a convenient and easy-to-use formulation for managing plant diseases. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - The modern distribution of the Western Eurasian subboreal butterfly Coenonympha leander (Esper, 1784) was studied in the Urals region, with its northeastern range limits specified at 56°N and 65°E. There are isolated local C. leander populations in the forest-steppe, while in the steppe zone the species is distributed fairly uniformly. In the Ural steppes the species is tolerant to moderate anthropogenic transformation of natural communities; the species is not rare and cannot serve as an indicator of intact communities, as opposed to other parts of its range. The geographic variations in the wing length and also the diameters and frequency of eyespots in the wing pattern are analyzed. The highest morphological specificity was detected in the marginal outpost populations, especially the northernmost population of Nizhnee Tukbaevo in Bashkortostan, which lives under the unique conditions of the azonal Mesyagutovo forest-steppe and tends to form a cline, with the wing size decreasing and the eyespot diameters and frequency increasing from north to south. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the differences between performing Nordic hamstring exercises once or twice a week on hamstring eccentric strength and other muscle-strain risk factors in high-level football players. Methods: In this randomized trial, 32 football players (18-23 y old) completed an 8-week Nordic hamstring exercise training program in 1 of 2 experimental groups: group 1 (once a week; n = 15) and group 2 (twice a week; n = 17). Knee-flexor/extensor peak torques and biceps femoris long-head muscle architecture were assessed through isokinetic dynamometry and ultrasonography, respectively, before and after the training programs. Analysis of covariance, effect sizes (ESs), and t tests for percentage change were used to assess the effect of the 2 interventions on the outcome measures. Results: Group 2 demonstrated higher hamstring concentric peak torque than group 1 posttraining (155-164 vs 149-158 N·m; P =.043; ES = 0.27), although there was also a statistical trend for higher hamstring eccentric peak torque (212-234 vs 198-221 N·m; P =.098; ES = 0.37), hamstring-to-quadriceps conventional ratio (0.56-0.59 vs 0.54-0.57; P =.089; ES = 0.31), and hamstring-to-quadriceps functional ratio (0.76-0.84 vs 0.71-0.79; P =.076; ES = 0.50). No between-groups differences were found for muscle thickness (P =.864; ES = 0.12), pennation angle (P =.289; ES = 0.18), fascicle length (P =.406; ES = 0.03), and quadriceps concentric peak torque (P =.340; ES = 0.02). Conclusion: Only the Nordic hamstring exercise training program performed twice a week strengthened the hamstrings of high-level football players, while similar changes in muscle architecture occurred with both once- and twice-weekly sessions. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - 'Ground effect' refers to the enhanced performance enjoyed by fliers or swimmers operating close to the ground. We derive a number of exact solutions for this phenomenon, thereby elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms involved in ground effect. Unlike previous analytic studies, our solutions are not restricted to particular parameter regimes, such as 'weak' or 'extreme' ground effect, and do not even require thin aerofoil theory. Moreover, the solutions are valid for a hitherto intractable range of flow phenomena, including point vortices, uniform and straining flows, unsteady motions of the wing, and the Kutta condition. We model the ground effect as the potential flow past a wing inclined above a flat wall. The solution of the model requires two steps: Firstly, a coordinate transformation between the physical domain and a concentric annulus; and secondly, the solution of the potential flow problem inside the annulus. We show that both steps can be solved by introducing a new special function which is straightforward to compute. Moreover, the ensuing solutions are simple to express and offer new insight into the mathematical structure of ground effect. In order to identify the missing physics in our potential flow model, we compare our solutions against new experimental data. The experiments show that boundary layer separation on the wing and wall occurs at small angles of attack, and we suggest ways in which our model could be extended to account for these effects. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Background: Avoiding superior inclination of the glenoid component in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is crucial. We hypothesized that superior inclination was underestimated in RSA. Our purpose was to describe and assess a new measurement of inclination for the inferior portion of the glenoid (where the baseplate rests). Methods: The study included 47 shoulders with rotator cuff tear arthropathy (mean age, 76 years). The reverse shoulder arthroplasty angle (RSA angle), defined as the angle between the inferior part of the glenoid fossa and the perpendicular to the floor of the supraspinatus, was compared with the global glenoid inclination (β angle or total shoulder arthroplasty [TSA] angle). Measurements were made on plain anteroposterior radiographs and reformatted 2-dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT) scans by 3 independent observers and compared with 3-dimensional (3D) software (Glenosys) measurements. Results: The mean RSA angle was 25° ± 8° on plain radiographs, 20° ± 6° on reformatted 2D CT scans, and 21° ± 5° via 3D reconstruction software. The mean TSA angle was on average 10° ± 5° lower than the mean RSA angle (P < .001); this difference was observed regardless of the method of measurement (radiographs, 2D CT, or 3D CT) and type of glenoid erosion according to Favard. In Favard type E1 glenoids with central concentric erosion, the difference between the 2 angles was 12° ± 4° (P < .001). Conclusion: The same angle cannot be used to measure glenoid inclination in anatomic and reverse prostheses. The TSA (or β) angle underestimates the superior orientation of the reverse baseplate in RSA. The RSA angle (20° ± 5°) needs to be corrected to achieve neutral inclination of the baseplate (RSA angle = 0°). Surgeons should be aware that E1 glenoids (with central erosion) are at risk for baseplate superior tilt if the RSA angle is not corrected. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Introduction. The coal industry occupies an important place in the Kuzbass industry, which involves a significant part of the employable-age population. Early detection of reduced myocardial contractility among coal industry workers, which develops as a result of arterial hypertension, will prevent the development of cardiovascular complications that can lead to disability or lethal outcome. The objective of the study was to evaluate the structural and functional parameters of the left ventricle in workers with and without arterial hypertension employed in coal industry enterprises with different methods of coal mining. Material and methods. The study included 178 coal mine workers and 112 open-pit coal mine workers aged from 40 to 55 years. All subjects underwent echocardiography to determine the geometric and functional parameters of the left ventricle and to assess its global longitudinal deformation. Results. Concentric remodeling of the left ventricle was revealed in open-pit coal mine workers with arterial hypertension. Its ejection fraction in all groups was within normal values but was lower in open pit coal mine workers with arterial hypertension (p=0.012). The global longitudinal strain of the left ventricle was significantly less in individuals with arterial hypertension (p<0.0001). In groups with normal blood pressure, it was significantly lower among miners than in open-pit coal mine workers (p=0.020). Conclusion. Concentric remodeling of the left ventricular myocardium was detected only in the workers of coal mines with arterial hypertension. Among the miners and open-pit coal mine workers with arterial hypertension with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a decrease in the longitudinal deformation of the left ventricular myocardium was recorded. Among the workers of the coal industry without arterial hypertension, a decrease in the longitudinal strain of the left ventricle was observed only in miners, which may be due to the influence of a complex of harmful factors of working in underground conditions. © 2020 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

AB  - The present article proposes a sociological approach to language planning, drawing a perspective based on an interpretation of the advances made by the sociolinguistics in the matter from the social systems theory. The theoretical framework comprehends language planning as a strategy to regulate language contact that operates in the interaction systems "that is, in the speakers' communicative practices". This approach is applied, as example, to different aspects of the planning of Mapudungún, Sami, and Maorí. It is concluded that the planning is executed through the introduction of distinctions (to speak/not to speak, to teach/not to teach, etc.) in the environment of the interaction systems. The relevance of the consideration of the sociohistorical conditions of language contact and regulation in the analysis of these processes it is highlighted. In addition, a warning is made about the analysis of Latin-American cases, which must consider that these societies are characterized by a concentric functional differentiation, that make them differ from the societies of the central modernity. © 2019 Universidad de Concepcion.

AB  - Steel braced frames are among the most effective lateral load resisting systems. The eccentrically braced frame has a higher ductility, less stiffness, and a better serviceability (limited retrofitting needed after the seismic excitations) compared to concentrically braced ones. Static indeterminacy is generally considered as the number of extra constraints or members in a structural system. In other words, redundancy is the ability of a structure to keep its stability after the onset of the failure or removal of its lateral load resisting elements, preventing it from collapse in the initial stages of loading. The redundancy of a system depends on the “dynamic” characteristics of its structure and properties of the applied earthquake excitations as well as its structural geometric features and details. This indeterminacy is called dynamic redundancy. In this study, the effects of the number and location of braced bays on redundancy were investigated to obtain the best pattern for regular 5 and 8-story buildings using nonlinear analysis. It also develops a relationship for the redundancy factor of the dual structural systems. Results show that position of braced bays is more effective on redundancy than the number of bays. It is also concluded that the building’s height affects the required number of bracing bays. The study also showed that the dynamic redundancy is different from the over-strength. According to the results of this research, for dual structural systems, it is recommended not to arrange the braces only in the perimeter of the plan. © 2020, Romanian Society of Acoustics.

AB  - Checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CIT) has revolutionized cancer treatment but it has also reached a standstill when an absent dialog between cancer and immune cells makes it irrelevant. This occurs with high prevalence in the context of “immune silent” and, even perhaps, “immune-excluded” tumors. The latter are characterized by T cells restricted to the periphery of cancer nests. Since in either case T cells do not come in direct contact with most cancer cells, CIT rests immaterial. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), may also be affected by limited access to antigen-bearing cancer cells. While lack of immunogenicity intuitively explains the immune silent phenotype, immune exclusion is perplexing. The presence of T cells at the periphery suggests that chemo-attraction recruits them and an immunogenic stimulus promotes their persistence. However, what stops the T cells from infiltrating the tumors’ nests and reaching the germinal center (GC)? Possibly, a concentric gradient of increased chemo-repulsion or decreased chemo-attraction demarcates an abrupt “do not trespass” warning. Various hypotheses suggest physical or functional barriers but no definitive consensus exists over the weight that each plays in human cancers. On one hand, it could be hypothesized that the intrinsic biology of cancer cells may degenerate from a “cancer stem cell” (CSC)-like phenotype in the GC toward a progressively more immunogenic phenotype prone to immunogenic cell death (ICD) at the periphery. On the other hand, the intrinsic biology of the cancer cells may not change but it is the disorderly architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that alters in a centripetal direction cancer cell metabolism, both directly and indirectly, the function of surrounding stromal cells. In this chapter, we examine whether the paradoxical exclusion of T cells from tumors may serve as a model to understand the requirements for tumor immune infiltration and, correspondingly, we put forth strategies to restore the dialog between immune cells and cancer to enhance the effectiveness of immune oncology (IO) approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The aim of this study was to check for upper limb volume asymmetry and strength ratio of shoulder muscle rotators in young tennis players. A total of 21 young male tennis players took part in the study. Subjects’ maturity status was determined using predicted age at peak height velocity (PHV); thus, the sample was divided into two groups: negative maturity offset values (PREPHV; n = 9) and positive values, including 0 (POSTPHV; n = 12). Upper limb volumes were estimated using the truncated cone method. Concentric peak torque in the external and internal shoulder rotations was determined using an isokinetic dynamometer at 60o.s−1. The external to internal rotation ratio was also calculated. There was morphological upper limb asymmetry in both groups (p < 0.05), with no difference between the groups. However, only the POSTPHV group presented shoulder strength asymmetry. External to internal rotation ratios were 76% and 89% for dominant and nondominant arms, respectively, in the POSTPHV group. PHV seems to be a critical period for functional asymmetry in young tennis players, particularly the internal rotation strength and conventional ratio of shoulder rotation. Thus, an assessment of shoulder rotator strength is required to monitor its progression and avoid the risk of injury in the dominant rotator cuff. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - All-steel buckling restrained brace (BRB) is a type of relatively new common bracings considering its low weight and whilst it is not required curing of mortar at the core of braces. In this study, a new form of all-steel BRB is introduced with corrugated edges of the core and the external sheath, and it was analyzed by using of finite element method. Existence of corrugated and ribbed edges led to enhance of buckling resistance. Numerical model was validated with laboratory samples, and after receiving an acceptable compliance in model behavior, the numerical models were offered. In this analysis, key parameters were size of brace section and distance of gap between the internal and external sheaths. The most appropriate size for gap between the core and external tube was determined to be 10 mm. Upon specifying the non-linear modeling parameter, two cases of frame with ordinary concentrically brace and the proposed all-steel BRB were compared for three structures with 4, 8 and 12 floors using pushover and non-linear time history analysis. The results demonstrated that utilizing of the proposed BRB will lead to an increase in behavior coefficient and structure ductility as well as an alteration in performance level of tall structures from collapse prevention to life safety level. © 2019, Korean Society of Steel Construction.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate the implications of the explicit brace-to-frame gusset connection modelling on the seismic performance assessment of steel concentrically-braced frames (CBFs). Two key modelling alternatives are considered, namely through the simulation of CBFs with: i) a benchmark experimentally-validated model, in which the gusset plates are explicitly designed and simulated; and ii) a more simplified option, whereby diagonals are simulated through a centreline-to-centreline approach with fully-pinned boundary conditions. Anticipating the consequences of a less refined modelling approach, a simplified regression-based design process to Eurocode 8 for these gusset connections is proposed, therefore avoiding the need for an explicit connection design for seismic assessment purposes. A third modelling option, an identical approach to the benchmark but with the gusset dimensions being determined through the aforementioned regression-based design process, is also considered. The importance of the explicit modelling of the gusset plate connections to obtain reliable estimates of seismic performance is shown through the comparison of the seismic performance of various building archetypes, considering different metrics (e.g. lateral deformations, earthquake-induced collapse risk and economic losses). Furthermore, the validity of the proposed gusset-design methodology is discussed, by comparing the resulting gusset dimensions against those associated with a rigorous seismic design process, as well as by comparing the seismic performance assessed with numerical models incorporating explicitly-designed or simplified-designed gusset geometries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The phase diagram of equimolar blends of AB and CD diblock copolymers has been studied using dissipative particle dynamics. All unlike blocks interacted with the same χ, except for the B-C interaction, for which χBC < 0 in order to prevent macrophase separation. The BC interaction was able to prevent macrophase separation except for low volume fractions of B and C (φBC ≲ 0.1) and relatively equal fractions of A and D. For high φBC (φBC ≳ 0.92), a disordered state was obtained. For all microphase separated states the shapes/morphologies were described by the ratios of the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration tensor and their sphericity. These were used to classify the domains as forming sphere, cylinders, lamellae, or branched/gyroidal structures. For φBC < 0.5 the BC domains acted as an interfacial region which compatibilized the A and D domains, while for φBC > 0.5 the BC domain filled in the space between A and D domains. Several interesting structures were formed including a novel connected/branched spheres morphology, hierarchical lamellae, concentric spheres/cylinders, and a combination of cylinders/lamellae. Comparisons are made with the linear diblock and linear triblock phase diagrams. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Context. Beyond the choice of wavefront control systems or coronographs, advanced data processing methods play a crucial role in disentangling potential planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among these methods, angular differential imaging (ADI) for data sets obtained in pupil tracking mode (ADI sequences) is one of the foremost research avenues, considering the many observing programs performed with ADI-based techniques and the associated discoveries. Aims. Inspired by the field of econometrics, here we propose a new detection algorithm for ADI sequences, deriving from the regime-switching model first proposed in the 1980s. Methods. The proposed model is very versatile as it allows the use of PSF-subtracted data sets (residual cubes) provided by various ADI-based techniques, separately or together, to provide a single detection map. The temporal structure of the residual cubes is used for the detection as the model is fed with a concatenated series of pixel-wise time sequences. The algorithm provides a detection probability map by considering two possible regimes for concentric annuli, the first one accounting for the residual noise and the second one for the planetary signal in addition to the residual noise. Results. The algorithm performance is tested on data sets from two instruments, VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE. The results show an overall better performance in the receiver operating characteristic space when compared with standard signal-to-noise-ratio maps for several state-of-the-art ADI-based post-processing algorithms.  © ESO 2020.

AB  - This paper proposes the use of Flower Constellation (FC) theory to facilitate the design of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) slotting system to avoid collisions between compliant satellites and optimize the available space. Specifically, it proposes the use of concentric orbital shells of admissible “slots” with stacked intersecting orbits that preserve a minimum separation distance between satellites at all times. The problem is formulated in mathematical terms and three approaches are explored: random constellations, single 2D Lattice Flower Constellations (2D-LFCs), and unions of 2D-LFCs. Each approach is evaluated in terms of several metrics including capacity, Earth coverage, orbits per shell, and symmetries. In particular, capacity is evaluated for various inclinations and other parameters. Next, a rough estimate for the capacity of LEO is generated subject to certain minimum separation and station-keeping assumptions and several trade-offs are identified to guide policy-makers interested in the adoption of a LEO slotting scheme for space traffic management. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Origami offers an avenue to program three-dimensional shapes via scale-independent and non-destructive fabrication. While such programming has focused on the geometry of a tessellation in a single transient state, here we provide a complete description of folding smooth saddle shapes from concentrically pleated squares. When the offset between square creases of the pattern is uniform, it is known as the pleated hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) origami. Despite its popularity, much remains unknown about the mechanism that produces such aesthetic shapes. We show that the mathematical limit of the elegant shape folded from concentrically pleated squares, with either uniform or non-uniform (e.g. functionally graded, random) offsets, is invariantly a hyperbolic paraboloid. Using our theoretical model, which connects geometry to mechanics, we prove that a folded hypar origami exhibits bistability between two symmetric configurations. Further, we tessellate the hypar origami and harness its bistability to encode multi-stable metasurfaces with programmable non-Euclidean geometries. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Maurelli, O, Bernard, PL, Dubois, R, Ahmaidi, S, and Prioux, J. Effects of the competitive season on the isokinetic muscle parameters changes in world-class handball players. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2778-2787, 2019-The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the competitive season on isokinetic muscular parameters of the lower limbs in world-class handball players. Nineteen, male, world-class, handball players (age, 26.6 ± 5.4 years) participated in the study. Two bilateral isokinetic tests of knee joint flexors (H; hamstring) and extensors (Q; quadriceps) were performed in the beginning and end of the competitive season to determine the peak torque (PT), the mean power, and agonist-antagonist ratio, dominant-nondominant ratio (DNDR), and combined ratio. The results showed a significant decrease in PT values at low angular velocity (60°·s) in concentric mode for Q on dominant leg (p < 0.001). The other PT values for dominant and nondominant legs at low and high angular velocities (240°·s) and in eccentric mode (30°·s) were not significantly different for Q and H. For mean power, values did not change at 60°·s. At 240°·s, we found a significant decrease in H for dominant leg (p < 0.001) but not for nondominant leg. In eccentric mode, the results showed a significant increase on both legs (p < 0.001). For the ratios, values significantly decreased for DNDR at 60°·s for Q (p < 0.03) and for agonist/antagonist ratio at 240°·s for the dominant leg (p < 0.01). The present results highlight the importance of integrating regular strength training sessions during the competitive season in world-class handball players. Accordingly, this study should help trainers to modify their planning to maximize strength and power qualities of the lower limbs of their players in addition to avoiding injuries.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is one of the most cultivated in Brazil and has lost productivity due to the attack of disease pests. Thus, it is necessary to develop new technologies capable of reducing damages caused by such biological agents. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the chemical management of ‘eyespot’ and the induction of resistance through the use of phosphites and acibenzolar-s-methyl (ASM), in association with commercial fungicides, affect the quality of soybean seeds. The study was conducted in the field, during two consecutive harvests in Dois Vizinhos, Paraná, Brazil, and a randomized blocks experimental designs was used. The response-variables evaluated were yield components, disease severity through specific diagrammatic scales, and seed quality attributes. The use of phosphite and ASM, with and without the combination of fungicides Glifosato, Azoxistrobina + Benzovindiflupir, Azoxistrobina + Ciproconazol and Picoxistrobina + Ciproconazol did not reduce the severity of the mildew and asian soybean rust. The use of combinations of different fungicides was sufficient to mitigate the severity effects of the mildew and asian rust on soybean crop. © 2020 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Currently, a few agricultural corporations are developing and producing a kind of radio-controlled agricultural airboat which could be used to weed and fertilize instead of human in the paddy fields. The authors improved the airboat realizing autonomous navigation by a global-positioning-system (GPS) compass in the previous research. To solve the limitation of GPS-based navigation in bad environment (e.g., areas with tall trees, bad weather conditions, etc.), a new positioning system was proposed by using a computer vision system mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide position information for an agricultural airboat engaged in autonomous fertilizing and herbicide application in this study. The computer vision system included a mini-computer, a color camera with a wide-angle lens, and a Bluetooth transmitter. The UAV was operated to hover high enough to overlook the paddy field by the computer vision system. The colored concentric circular markers were made to put at the corners of the paddy field to facilitate the paddy field recognition using Fitzgibbon ellipse fitting algorithm. Utilize the geographic position by GPS and image position by computer vision system of each markers to obtain the perspective transformation matrix for transforming the top view image of the paddy field. At the created paddy-field-based coordinate, the UAV detects the airboat position by using the white color feature and central symmetrical contour feature of the airboat and transmits the position information to airboat in real time by Bluetooth for airboat navigation. The results of navigation experiment showed that the RMS lateral errors were 0.17 m, 0.10 m and 0.11 m in 3 predefined paths, respectively. This accuracy level was better than that of differential-GPS (DGPS). It is acceptable for providing positioning service for the airboat autonomous navigation in paddy fields. Furthermore, this UAV-airboat solution was a beneficial attempt which can not only prevent the instability of GPS-based airboat navigation in bad environment, but also avoid the herbicide spray drift problem that occurs in UAV-spraying in the air. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The apical annuli are among the most intriguing and understudied structures in the cytoskeleton of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We mapped the proteome of the annuli in Toxoplasma by reciprocal proximity biotinylation (BioID), and validated five apical annuli proteins (AAP1–5), Centrin2, and an apical annuli methyltransferase. Moreover, inner membrane complex (IMC) suture proteins connecting the alveolar vesicles were also detected and support annuli residence within the sutures. Super-resolution microscopy identified a concentric organisation comprising four rings with diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm. The high prevalence of domain signatures shared with centrosomal proteins in the AAPs together with Centrin2 suggests that the annuli are related and/or derived from the centrosomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the AAPs are conserved narrowly in coccidian, apicomplexan parasites that multiply by an internal budding mechanism. This suggests a role in replication, for example, to provide pores in the mother IMC permitting exchange of building blocks and waste products. However, presence of multiple signalling domains and proteins are suggestive of additional functions. Knockout of AAP4, the most conserved compound forming the largest ring-like structure, modestly decreased parasite fitness in vitro but had no significant impact on acute virulence in vivo. In conclusion, the apical annuli are composed of coiled-coil and signalling proteins assembled in a pore-like structure crossing the IMC barrier maintained during internal budding. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: The incidence rate of elbow injuries has been rising in recent years among professional baseball pitchers. Determining valid screening procedures that allow practitioners to identify pitchers at an increased risk of such injuries is therefore of critical importance. Purpose: To validate the use of countermovement jump (CMJ) tests as a diagnostic tool for pitcher conditioning. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: More than 500 pitchers at a single professional baseball organization performed preseason CMJ assessments on a force plate before the 2013 to 2018 seasons. Three measurements were extracted from ground-reaction force data during the test: eccentric rate of force development (ERFD), average vertical concentric force (AVCF), and concentric vertical impulse (CVI). Athletic trainers at the organization collected detailed information on elbow and shoulder injury rates as well as workload (pitch count) throughout the rest of the season. Poisson regression models were fit to investigate the dependency of injury rates on CMJ test performance. Results: ERFD, CVI, and AVCF were all significant predictors of elbow injury risk after accounting for pitcher age, weight, and workload. The analysis identified 3 specific indicators of heightened risk based on the results of a CMJ scan: low ERFD, a combination of low AVCF and high CVI, and a combination of high AVCF and low CVI. In contrast, shoulder injury risk was roughly independent of all 3 CMJ test measurements. Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis of the entire kinetic chain’s involvement in pitching by establishing a link between CMJ test performance and elbow injury risk in professional baseball pitchers. CMJ assessment may be a powerful addition to injury risk alert and prevention protocols. Pitchers in high-risk groups can be prescribed specific exercise plans to improve movement imbalances. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In Trumpet, Jackie Kay takes Toni Morrison in as Kay’s fictive mother by adopting and adapting the formal and ethical patterns of Morrison’s Jazz. Kay opens up and connects questions of gender transition, migration and (cultural) adoption by replaying variations of Morrison’s project on an ethics of unknowing, cognitive improvement and transformative adoption. Formal innovations-such as narratorial unreliability, gaps and disjunctions of perspective-are indissociable from Kay’s and Morrison’s respective ethical and reconstructive projects. Starting with protagonists in tabloid-press scandals, Kay and Morrison endow them with a groundlessness that promises cognitive and ethical perplexity and complexity-a singular, atypical perspective that is, surprisingly, the very condition of possibility for transformed connection. Trumpet and Jazz share a concentric form: revolving around a middle section, they radiate outward from a formulaic riff toward waves of variations-and from the seemingly singular and atypical toward implicating other characters and readers in call-and-response. Turning to Kay and Morrison is particularly fruitful in addressing renewed public anxiety around the seemingly unrelated issues of trans identity, immigration and belonging. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The present study assessed the effects of ethanol exposure during adolescence or adulthood. We exposed Wistar rats, males or females, to self-administered 8–10% (v/v) ethanol (BINGE group) during the first 2 h of the dark cycle, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) during postnatal days (PDs) 32–54 or 72–94 (adolescent and adults, respectively). During this period, controls were only handled, and a third (IP) condition was given ethanol intraperitoneal administrations, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), at doses that matched those self-administered by the BINGE group. The rats were tested for ethanol intake and preference in a two-bottle (24 h long) choice test, shortly before (PD 30 or 70) and shortly after (PD 56 or 96) exposure to the binge or intraperitoneal protocol; and then tested for free-choice drinking during late adulthood (PDs 120–139) in intermittent two-bottle intake tests. Binge drinking was significantly greater in adolescents vs. adults, and was blocked by naloxone (5.0 mg/kg) administered immediately before the binge session. Mean blood ethanol levels (mg/dl) at termination of binge session 3 were 60.82 ± 22.39. Ethanol exposure at adolescence, but not at adulthood, significantly reduced exploration of an open field-like chamber and significantly increased shelter-seeking behavior in the multivariate concentric square field. The rats that had been initially exposed to ethanol at adolescence drank, during the intake tests conducted at adulthood, significantly more than those that had their first experience with ethanol at adulthood, an effect that was similar among BINGE, IP and control groups. The study indicates that binge ethanol drinking is greater in adolescent that in adults and is associated with heightened ethanol intake at adulthood. Preventing alcohol access to adolescents should reduce the likelihood of problematic alcohol use or alcohol-related consequences. © Copyright © 2020 Salguero, Suarez, Luque, Ruiz-Leyva, Cendán, Morón and Pautassi.

AB  - Antipredatory displays that incorporate hidden contrasting coloration are found in a variety of different animals. These displays are seen in organisms that have drab coloration at rest, but when disturbed reveal conspicuous coloration. Examples include the bright abdomens of mountain katydids and the colorful underwings of hawk moths. Such hidden displays can function as secondary defenses, enabling evasion of a pursuant predator. To begin to understand why some species have these displays while others do not, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate factors associated with the evolution of hidden contrasting coloration in leaf-footed bugs. First, we investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with body size because these displays are considered to be more effective in larger organisms. We then investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with an alternative antipredatory defense, in this case rapid autotomy. We found that leaf-footed bugs with hidden contrasting coloration tended to autotomize more slowly, but this result was not statistically significant. We also found that the presence of a body size association was dependent upon the form of the hidden color display. Leaf-footed bugs that reveal red/orange coloration were the same size, on average, as species without a hidden color display. However, species that reveal white patches on a black background were significantly larger than species without a hidden color display. These results highlight the diversity of forms that hidden contrasting color signal can take, upon which selection may act differently. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a visual bridge between a software application and end users, through which they can interact with each other. With the development of technology and aesthetics, the visual effects of the GUI are more and more attracting. However, such GUI complexity posts a great challenge to the GUI implementation. According to our pilot study of crowdtesting bug reports, display issues such as text overlap, blurred screen, missing image always occur during GUI rendering on different devices due to the software or hardware compatibility. They negatively influence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience. To detect these issues, we propose a novel approach, Owl Eye, based on deep learning for modelling visual information of the GUI screenshot. Therefore, Owl Eye can detect GUIs with display issues and also locate the detailed region of the issue in the given GUI for guiding developers to fix the bug. We manually construct a large-scale labelled dataset with 4, 470 GUI screenshots with UI display issues and develop a heuristics-based data augmentation method for boosting the performance of our Owl Eye. The evaluation demonstrates that our Owl Eye can achieve 85% precision and 84% recall in detecting UI display issues, and 90% accuracy in localizing these issues. We also evaluate Owl Eye with popular Android apps on Google Play and F-droid, and successfully uncover 57 previously-undetected UI display issues with 26 of them being confirmed or fixed so far. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - In advanced designs of DEMO breeding blankets with ceramic breeder, the structural material EUROFER is in direct contact with the pebbles of the ceramic breeder (Li4SiO4 + Li2TiO3) that results in a loss of constituent elements in the ceramic and the formation of a corrosion layer on EUROFER under operation relevant conditions. The impact of this corrosion attack on damage mechanisms which are significantly influenced by microstructural changes at the surface, in particular fatigue, needs to be considered in the design of affected components and is therefore investigated within the work reported here. Fatigue specimens made out of EUROFER in unconstrained contact to ceramic breeder pebbles were exposed to purge gas conditions for different durations. The chemical surface attack observed after the exposure is characterized by round stains, partly even round dimples, consisting of concentric diffusion zones which meet in case of the long exposure time forming an almost closed corrosion multi-layer. The impact of this attack on the fatigue behavior was subsequently investigated by performing strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests at 550 °C. To cover the scatter expected for the fatigue lifetime, a sufficient number of LCF experiments were conducted. The results show significant reduction of the fatigue lifetime, which quantitatively depends on the level of the attack/exposure time as well as the level of the applied load/strain amplitude. © 2020 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology

AB  - The rise of world Englishes has challenged the emphasis on native-speaker accents and cultures in English language teaching. This study aimed to investigate the representation of world Englishes and cultures in three global language teaching textbooks, namely Interchange, English Result, and American English File. The textbooks were subjected to content analysis regarding their reference to Inner, Outer, and Expanding Circles’ varieties and their associated cultural contents. Kachru (The alchemy of English: The spread functions and models of non-native Englishes. Oxford: Pergamon, 1986) notion of Concentric Circles, and the categorization proposed by Pfister and Borzelli (Unterrichtspraxis 10:102–108, 1977) functioned as a framework to see which aspects of each culture (social, personal, religion/arts/humanities, political systems and institutions, and environmental concerns) were addressed in these textbooks. Findings revealed that most of the references to the three circles and cultural elements embodied in the textbooks were toward Inner Circle countries in American English File. Furthermore, in Interchange and English Result series, reference to Outer and Expanding Circles’ varieties and cultural elements were comparatively more evident. However, all the three textbook series mostly represented Inner-Circle accents. These findings have implications for materials developers to adopt an EIL-aware approach and to avoid the sole representation of native speakers’ linguistic norms and cultures in ELT textbooks. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To define based on expert opinion and practical experience using a systematic and scientific approach, (1) the perceived most effective exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injury in elite footballers; and, (2) when and how these exercise programs are prescribed based on the number of days between games i.e. implementation strategy. Methods: A Delphi survey obtained opinions and assessed for agreement. Delphi respondents consisted of 21 experienced sports practitioners (12 ± 5.3 years in elite football and with an academic background) belonging to 18 teams from the Big-5 European football leagues; England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain. Three teams were represented collaboratively by two experts. The Delphi process involves sequential rounds each evolving based on the responses from the previous. The number of rounds is not pre-defined and continues until an agreement is either achieved or it is clear that no agreement will be reached. Frequency of responses was recorded where the agreement was sought (i.e. in closed questions) and an agreement was achieved if ≥ 13/18 (70%) respondents agreed. For open-ended questions, a qualitative content analysis was performed to identify recurring themes and when themes were specified by ≥ 13 (70%), these were also considered as reaching an agreement. Practitioners had the opportunity to raise concerns if they disagreed with the ‘agreement from recurrent themes’. Results: There were four Delphi rounds (100% response for each round). Sprinting and High-Speed Running (HSR) focused exercises were agreed as most effective (perceived) to prevent muscle injuries. Eccentric exercise was perceived as the next most effective. It was agreed that sprinting and HSR be integrated into coaches training, and target 100% of players worst-case match scenario (e.g. volume, intensity) based on individual maximum speeds. Eccentric exercise was recommended to be implemented according to the context of the main football session and planned/actual sprinting and HSR content. It was agreed that eccentrics can be performed before or after training, context dependent. The day to perform specific sprinting and HSR or eccentric exercises depended on the proximity of previous and upcoming matches. Other exercises reaching agreement as ‘somewhat effective’ included concentric and isometric, horizontal and vertical plyometrics, coordination, core and dynamic flexibility in addition to core stability. No agreement was reached for multi-joint, resisted sprinting, kicking or agility exercises nor simultaneous single-leg strength and stability. Finally, no agreement was reached regarding programming variables e.g. sets, repetitions as deemed too contextual. Conclusion: Regarding exercise-based strategies, particular importance agreed by the Delphi expert group was to focus on sprinting, HSR and eccentric exercises, integrated with a variety of other exercise modes which also carry some level of effectiveness in a multidimensional programme. Context was agreed to be key and decision-making about when to undertake/ how to prescribe exercise strategies to be made according to the content of normal football training and the proximity of matches. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Balance of strength and flexibility between the dominant (DL) and non-dominant limbs (NDL) in young soccer players is essential, since it can minimize the possible injury-triggering mechanisms and their negative influence on performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the unilateral and bilateral strength and flexibility between the DL and NDL in young soccer players. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 30 individuals (aged 15.97 ± 0.67 years). The isokinetic strength was measured at the velocities of 60° s and 180° s in the concentric action of the quadriceps and hamstrings as well as eccentric of the hamstrings, and in the conventional and functional ratios, along with hip flexion range of motion. Results: The results showed the athletes had an eccentric strength of the hamstrings at 60° s in the DL significantly (p < 0.05) stronger than in the NDL, and the DL had a significant H/Q ratio (p < 0.05) more balanced than the NDL. Conclusions: Young soccer athletes may present a non-standard isokinetic results. These results are observed because of the difference in muscle strength of the posterior thigh compared to DL and NDL and the balance relation between the quadriceps and the hamstrings, generating an asymmetry of strength between the limbs and on the same member. It is necessary to monitor and devise training strategies to avoid these imbalances in order to prevent injuries. © 2018 FC Barcelona

AB  - Here, based on the digital image correlation method, a 3-D high-speed videography system was constructed for flexible body lowspeed impact tests. A spherical cylindrical rod-square plate system was taken as the test object and out-of-plane contact impact tests were conducted. By settingthe system's key parameters, the flexible body's wholefield strain responses were measured and compared withthe results of strain gauge measurement and numerical simulation. Results showedthata 3-D system avoids drawbacks of a 2-D system being easy to be affected byout-of-plane displacements, and it can be used to accurately measure a flexible body's wholefield displacement, velocity and strain response.2 bodies' central normal impact tests were conducted to obtain flexible bodies'impact process and whole field strain distribution features. It was shown that their strains in X and Y directions reveal the shape of "peanut",their principal strain fieldsreveal the shape of "concentric circle"; their shear strain fieldsreveal the shape of "four-spindle"; in the case of low-speed collision,the maximum principal strain at the collision point and impact velocity reveals a secondary power relation. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

AB  - This report provides an update of the epidemiology of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union during the period November 2018 to October 2019. In this period, ASF has been confirmed in Slovakia, whereas Czechia became officially ASF-free in March 2019, bringing the number of affected countries in the EU to nine. The report provides a narrative update of the situation in the different countries and an analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of the disease. There has been no increase in the proportion of seropositive hunted wild boar in the affected areas. In hunted animals, the proportions of wild boar testing polymerase chain reaction-positive and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-positive has remained low (< 0.05). In addition to the obvious seasonal peak in summer in domestic pigs, seasonality of ASF in wild boar was statistically confirmed. A network analysis demonstrated that the median velocity of the natural propagation of the disease in wild boar populations was between 2.9 and 11.7 km/year. Human-mediated spread, both in pigs and wild boar, however, remains important. Several wild boar- and domestic pig-related risk factors for ASF occurrence in non-commercial farms in Romania were identified with a case–control study. This report also updates an extensive literature review on control measures to stop the spread of the disease in wild boar and on measures to separate wild boar populations. Several new studies have been identified in this reporting period, but these did not alter the conclusions of the previous reporting period. Field experience with the use of fences as part of the control strategy deployed in the Belgian focal outbreak of ASF in wild boar is described. So far, the measures have proven effective to keep ASF virus inside the affected area. This strategy included a combination of different measures, namely zoning, carcass removal, a complete feeding ban, specific hunting regulations and depopulation actions depending on the zone, a partial ban of people and logging, and setting up a network of concentric fences. © 2020 European Food Safety Authority.

AB  - Load currents and short-circuit currents in high-voltage power cable lines are sources of the induced voltages in the power cables' concentric metallic sheaths. When power cables operate with single-point bonding, which is the simplest bonding arrangement, these induced voltages may introduce an electric shock hazard or may lead to damage of the cables' outer non-metallic sheaths at the unearthed end of the power cable line. To avoid these aforementioned hazards, both-ends bonding of metallic sheaths is implemented but, unfortunately, it leads to increased power losses in the power cable line, due to the currents circulating through the sheaths. A remedy for the circulating currents is cross bonding-the most advanced bonding solution. Each solution has advantages and disadvantages. In practice, the decision referred to its selection should be preceded by a wide analysis. This paper presents a case study of the induced sheath voltages in a specific 110 kV power cable line. This power cable line is a specific one, due to the relatively low level of transferred power, much lower than the one resulting from the current-carrying capacity of the cables. In such a line, the induced voltages in normal operating conditions are on a very low level. Thus, no electric shock hazard exists and for this reason, the simplest arrangement-single-point bonding-was initially recommended at the project stage. However, a more advanced computer-based investigation has shown that in the case of the short-circuit conditions, induced voltages for this arrangement are at an unacceptably high level and risk of the outer non-metallic sheaths damage occurs. Moreover, the induced voltages during short circuits are unacceptable in some sections of the cable line even for both-ends bonding and cross bonding. The computer simulations enable to propose a simple practical solution for limiting these voltages. Recommended configurations of this power cable line-from the point of view of the induced sheath voltages and power losses-are indicated. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Concentric tube robots, or CTRs, are tentacle-like robots composed of precurved telescoping tubes (Fig. 1a) and are controlled by rotating and translating each individual tube [6]. Their dexterity and small diameter enable minimally-invasive surgery in constrained areas, such as accessing the pituitary gland via the sinuses. Unfortunately, their unintuitive kinematics make manually guiding the tip while also avoiding obstacles with the entire tentacle-like shape extremely difficult [19]. This motivates a need for new user interfaces and planning algorithms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Context: Theoretical models propose that the spatial extent at which landscape structure best predicts species responses (scale of effect, SoE) depends on habitat and dietary specialization, landscape metrics, and response variables. However, empirical support for such models is scarce, especially for apex predators. Objectives: To determine SoE for diurnal raptors, and test for differences among ecological traits of habitat and dietary specialization, landscape metrics, and response variables. Methods: We conducted 1.5 km transect surveys of diurnal raptors at 26 sites in a tropical dry forest from western Mexico. We measured four landscape metrics (forest cover, matrix hardness, forest patch density, edge density) in 16 concentric landscapes (400 to 3400 ha) around each survey site. We then assessed the landscape size at which each landscape metric best predicted each response variable (abundance, species richness, temporal beta diversity). Finally, we tested for differences in SoE among ecological traits of raptors, landscape metrics, and response variables. Results: Landscape composition metrics of forest cover and matrix hardness decreased with increasing landscape size, and were the main landscape predictors influencing diurnal raptors. SoE differed significantly among landscape metrics, being larger for forest cover (2433.3 ha) than matrix hardness (1500 ha). However, SoE did not differ significantly among ecological traits of raptors, or response variables. Conclusions: SoE was mainly driven by spatial metrics, with diurnal raptors being more strongly associated with forest cover measured over larger scales. This supports findings for other taxa and suggests that forest cover influences dispersal success across larger scales. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - An effective vibration control device, the pendulum tuned mass damper (P-TMD), can be easily realized as a mass supported on rolling or sliding pendulum bearings. While the bearings’ concavity provides the desired gravitational restoring force, the necessary dissipative force can be obtained either from additional dampers installed in parallel with the bearings or from the same friction resistance developing within each bearing between the roller/slider and the rolling/sliding surface. The latter solution may prove cheaper and more compact but implies that the P-TMD effectiveness will be amplitude dependent if the friction coefficient is kept uniform along the rolling/sliding surface, as in conventional friction bearings. In this case, the friction P-TMD will be as efficient as a viscous P-TMD only at a given vibration level, with large performance reductions at other levels. To avoid this inconvenience, this paper proposes a new type of sliding variable friction pendulum (VFP) TMD, called the VFP-TMD, in which the sliding surface is divided into two concentric regions: a circular inner region, having the lowest possible friction coefficient and the same dimensions of the slider, and an annular outer region, having a friction coefficient set to an optimal value. A similar arrangement has been recently proposed to realize adaptive seismic isolation devices, but no specific application to TMDs is reported. To assess the VFP-TMD performance, first its analytical model is derived, rigorously accounting for geometric nonlinearities as well as for the variable (in time and space) pressure distribution along the contact area, and then, an optimal design methodology is presented. Finally, numerical simulations show the influence of the main design parameters on the device behavior and demonstrate that the VFP-TMD can achieve nearly the same effectiveness of viscous P-TMDs, while considerably outperforming conventional uniform-friction P-TMDs. The proposed analytical model can be used to enhance or validate existing models of VFP isolators that assume a constant and uniform contact pressure distribution. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Comparative study of 5, 10 and 15 storied steel Concentrically Braced Frames (CBF) designed by Performance Based Plastic Design (PBPD) method and Force Based Design (FBD) method is presented here. The parameters selected for comparison of the frames are (a) Lateral load distribution (b) Design sections of members (c) Seismic performance and (d) Cost. It is observed that the lateral load’s distribution in case of PBPD frames is found more factual. The column sections of PBPD frames are heavier, and brace sections are lighter compared to FBD frames given the fact that PBPD is designed for higher ductility factor. The PBPD method gives a better seismic performance by achieving the predetermined failure mechanism and avoiding total collapse. Taller structures offer cost-effectiveness for PBPD method. © BEIESP.

AB  - Soluble phosphates are the most common sources currently used in crop production in tropical soils; however, they present low efficiency and are more expensive than natural rock phosphates. The objective was to develop new phosphate fertilizers with slow solubility through the partial acidification of rock phosphates (RPs), incorporating materials with adsorption characteristics to favor slow dissolution and prevent phosphorus (P) fixation in the soil. Three rock phosphates, Araxá (ARP), Bayovar (BRP) and Morocco (MRP), were evaluated at two acidulation levels (25 and 50% Ac.) and two additives; pillared clays (PILC) and zeolites (Zeo), plus triple superphosphate (TSP) and a control (nil-P). The soil diffusion was evaluated in concentric rings in Petri dishes. Solubility was evaluated in leaching columns and sampled in layers from surface for P forms in the soil profile. The relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) was evaluated in maize. Greater diffusion was provided by TSP, followed by BRP and MRP both with 50% Ac. + Zeo, and MRP with 50% Ac. + PILC. Percolated P was more pronounced under TSP, followed by RPs (BRP and MRP) with 50% Ac. + Zeo. BRP and MRP + 50% Ac. were the most promising sources with RAE above 74% compared to TSP. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of the role of fungi in prehistoric human societies and, in particular, to determine their use as tinder in fire-lighting technologies. The case of La Draga (Banyoles, NE Spain), an Early Neolithic site with extraordinary conservation of organic materials, is presented. At this site, a well preserved and abundant assemblage of fruiting bodies of fungi has been recovered in a waterlogged environment. The comparison of the taxa identified with evidence of fungal spores is analysed in order to provide a better understanding of the process of fungi incorporation into the archaeological site. Finds at La Draga demonstrate that the gathering of bracket fungi was a frequent practice during the Early Neolithic occupation. A total of 86 fruiting bodies have been studied and six different taxa have been identified: Ganoderma adspersum, Daldinia concentrica, Daedalea quercina, Lenzites warnieri, Coriolopsis gallica, and Skeletocutis nivea. The taxa identified in the fruiting bodies have not been identified among the fungal spores from the soil sediments. Comparison of the presence of fungal spores and fruiting bodies provides additional arguments to support the hypothesis that bracket fungi were gathered, dried and stored to be used by the inhabitants of La Draga. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of fatiguing exercise on sex-related differences in the function of hamstring and quadriceps muscles at several angular velocities and joint angles. Physically active participants (50 male: 28.7 ± 4.5y, 1.82 ± 0.07 m, 82.3 ± 6.87 kg; 50 female: 27.0 ± 5.8y, 1.61 ± 0.08 m, 68.75 ± 9.24 kg) carried out an isokinetic assessment to determine concentric and eccentric torques during knee extension and flexion actions at three different angular velocities (60/180/300°/s). The H/QFUNCT was calculated using peak torque (PT) values at 3 different joint-angle-specific (15°, 30° and 45° of knee flexion). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare within group results. Between group comparisons of sex-related differences were assessed by independent T-tests. Fatiguing exercise in males resulted in a decrease in H/QFUNCT ratios for each angle of knee flexion at both 60°/s and 300°/s angular velocities (p < 0.05). In females, significant decreases in H/QFUNCT ratios were observed following fatiguing exercise for each angle of knee flexion and angular velocity (p < 0.01). Significant differences in H/QFUNCT ratios following fatiguing exercise were evident between males and females at each joint angle and angular velocity (p < 0.01). These findings indicate sex related differences in H/QFUNCT ratios following fatiguing exercise. Females have greater reductions in torque and H/QFUNCT ratios following fatigue than their male counterparts. This potentially exposes females to higher risks of injury, particularly when fatigued. Practitioners should attend to the imbalance in fatigue resistance of hamstring and quadriceps function, particularly in female athletes. © 2019, © 2019 European College of Sport Science.

AB  - Eustace, SJ, Page, RM, and Greig, M. angle specific isokinetic metrics highlight strength training needs of elite youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3258-3265, 2020-The purpose of this study was to assess traditional and angle-specific isokinetic strength of eccentric knee flexors (eccKFs) and concentric knee extensors (conKEs) between senior professional and youth soccer players. Thirty-four male soccer players (17 senior and 17 youth) were recruited for bilateral assessments at 180, 270, and 60°·s. Peak torque (PT), dynamic control ratio (DCR), angle of peak torque (APT), functional range (FR), angle-specific torque (AST), and angle-specific DCR (DCRAST) were compared. The eccentric knee flexor (eccKF) and conKE PT (p = 0.782) and DCR (p = 0.508) were not different between groups across all angular velocities. Significant differences were identified for eccKF APT (p = 0.018) and FR (p = 0.006), DCRAST at 270°·s (p = 0.031), and in AST data recorded across angular velocities for eccKF and conKE (p = 0.003). Traditional strength measures were not sensitive to playing age, with implications for misinterpretation in training prescription. By contrast, AST data did differentiate between ages. Strength deficits that highlight the muscle contraction type, angular velocity, and joint angle can be manipulated within an individualized training intervention. Given the relevance to injury etiology, this study highlights potential implications for improved assessment strategies to inform training prescription for performance and injury prevention. Given the high number of injuries in adolescent soccer players, and in line with previous recommendations, practitioners should consider using more informed and specific strength and conditioning practices at younger ages.

AB  - Muscle strength imbalances and poor flexibility are frequently described as risk factors for hamstring injury. Preventive strategies include eccentric exercises, but the influence of field eccentric exercises on these risk factors remains unclear. We investigated the influence of a field hamstring eccentric program on hamstring strength and flexibility. Twenty-seven amateur athletes were randomly assigned to an intervention (n=13) or control group (n=14). In the intervention group, participants were involved in 15 sessions of four eccentric exercises. Peak torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios, passive and active flexibility were analyzed. No significant modifications of strength, passive or active flexibility were observed in the control group (p>0.05). Hamstring eccentric peak torque (+7.1%) and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (9.3%) were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the intervention group, but not concentric strength (p<0.05). Passive straight leg raise was significantly increased by 11.4° (+12.7%, p<0.001), but not active flexibility (+3.1%, p>0.05). In conclusion, a 6-week eccentric program, including four field exercises for hamstring muscles, is an effective method of improving eccentric strength, functional ratios and, especially, passive flexibility. As this program may be easily implemented in a real-world context, this association of multiple eccentric exercises might be useful in an injury prevention strategy. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - There are many interference fringe patterns with nonuniformly illuminating background noise. Nonuniformly illuminating background noise may arise from diverse sources, such as scratches, small interfering concentric circles, gaussian noise, etc. with a nonuniform light source. In this work, we propose a practical fringe pattern denoising method using a simple neural network. However, nonuniform illumination prevents us from comparing the denoised images with the ground truths. The verification of the proposed method is shown indirectly using the uniformized results obtained from a nonuniform illumination correcting process. © 2019, The Korean Physical Society.

AB  - We determined the release density, dispersal capacity, and optimal storage conditions for the parasitoid Telenomus remus Nixon to control Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith). Each of eighty plants within an 829-m2 plot were artificially infested with one S. frugiperda egg mass in a maize field. These plants were distributed evenly along four concentric squares which allowed for 14 different distances from a central release point (range 3.6–20.3 m). Egg parasitoids were released at four densities (0; 100,000; 150,000; and 200,000 adults/ha) in two vegetative maize growth stages (V4-5 and V8-9). After a 48-h exposure, egg masses were retrieved to evaluate parasitism rates. Spodoptera frugiperda egg parasitism by T. remus did not differ among the three parasitoid release densities. Egg parasitism decreased linearly with increasing distance from the release point, but this was influenced by the crop’s phenological stage. Egg parasitism was 28% higher at the older than younger growth stages, and dispersal distance and area of dispersal were 35% and 16% lower, respectively, at the older stage. In the laboratory, we evaluated the effects of six storage periods (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days) of S. frugiperda eggs at four temperatures (5, 10, 15, and 20°C) on T. remus adult emergence. Our results showed the highest emergence when eggs were stored at 15°C for ≤9 days. Altogether, we identified important mass release and rearing parameters for augmentative biocontrol of T. remus on S. frugiperda eggs that may help reduce production and marketing costs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Concentrically braced steel frames (hereafter known as CBFs) are used extensively in buildings as a lateral resistance system. Under the rare earthquakes, buckling and failure of brace would lead to the decrease of bearing capacity and stiffness of the CBFs. The frame of structure as the reserve system provides reserve stiffness and reserve strength after failure of braces. Shaking table tests were performed on three-story CBF to investigate the non-linear reactions of low-ductility CBF under earthquakes and the seismic behavior of reserve system after the failure of braces. The model structure was a 1:6.5 scaled three-story, three-bay and two-span chevron CBF with low-ductility braces. The braces with large width-to-thickness ratio cannot meet the requirements of seismic detailing according to Chinese seismic code. Two ground motions stand for hard and soft soil sites were loaded unidirectionally and amplified by degrees. The braces in first story fracture under rare earthquake of intensity seven. The reserve system avoids the predominant period of hard soil site earthquake after brace failure, and thus has no obvious damage under rare earthquake up to intensity nine. The reserve system is sensitive to ground motions of soft soil site. The structure is near to collapse under rare earthquake of intensity eight. The second and third stories remain elastic all the while. This test shows that, with rational design of reserve system, the low-ductility steel CBF has favorable seismic performance and considerable collapse prevention performance. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures.

AB  - This paper deals with the casing surface and blade tip clearance in an axial flow compressor in aero-engines. The clearance in between the tips of the blade and the casing surface should be optimized by considering the thermal and internal expansion as well as changes in concentricity due to shock loading events, to prevent catastrophic tip to casing contact. These parameters play a significant role in the efficiency enhancement of aero-engine. Generally, In case of shock loading, the tip of the blade severely damages the casing surface, which is a primary concern of an aero-engineer. To protect the tip as well as the casing, there is a coating developed called abradable coating, which is not only to allow for closer clearances. But to automatically adjust clearances, in-situ, to accept physical events and thermal variation that may be found during its exploitation. An abradable coating must have sufficient strength and hardness to resist the rigidness of aero-engine handling during assembly, transportation, and exploitation. At the same time, it must be soft enough to allow the axial flow compressor rotor blades to cut through it easily without getting pilled off in lumps. The current investigation is done to optimize the plasma coating parameters such as Powder feed rate, Plasma power, powder grain size, Gun Velocity, spray distance, Argon/hydrogen ratio, and their pressure, etc. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The flowing behavior of montmorillonite flocs coagulated in NaCl solution was visualized using a device called Couette chamber which was designed to analyze the strength of floc against breakup in a laminar shear flow generated in the gap between two concentric cylinders. The rotation ax of cylinders was oriented horizontally to avoid the effect of sedimentation during measurement. Observation of the morphology of flowing flocs was performed with a high-speed camera under sufficiently high salt concentration to induce rapid coagulation of montmorillonite as a function of shear rate. The recorded image of flocs demonstrated that the average flowing flocs is approximated by an ellipsoid of equivalent inertial moment with a length ratio of two principal axes being around 2. The most probable orientation of the major axis was found to be the flow direction. Assuming flocs are ellipsoids and will be disrupted by the effect of extensional component of the flow field, the cohesive strength supporting the disintegrating clusters was calculated on the basis of the simple model of floc strength proposed previously for the breakup of a floc under turbulent flow. The tendency of structural enforcement by the rearrangement of internal clusters was recorded with an increase in size of floc irrespective of ionic strength. In addition, the enforcement of cohesive strength by the effect of dehydration of proximately adsorbed sodium ions at extremely high ionic strength was confirmed.

AB  - A case study of the road subsidence hazard that occurred during the construction of a cable tunnel was conducted. The cable tunnel was built 30 m below the ground surface by using the shield tunnelling method, parallel to a sewage pipe with a diameter of 2000 mm. During shield docking, the bolt of the seal plate in the shield segment ruptured. This rupture led to water flooding into tunnel and the settlement of the ground surface. The causes of the subsidence hazard were analysed and discussed. The results of this case study indicate that risk assessment and hazard analysis of shield tunnels should be conducted separately in the planning, design, and construction phases for ensuring disaster mitigation. To avoid the occurrence of a subsidence hazard, sensors should be embedded 30 m below the ground surface and near the shield machine. Using monitoring sensors and increasing the number of observed frequency are effective in enhancing the settlement sensitivity so as to provide early warning information. Ground improvement is suggested even while using the concentric interlace docking method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Steel multi-tiered concentrically braced frames (MT-CBFs) are commonly used in North America as a lateral load resisting system of tall single-story buildings. Past studies show that MT-CBF columns designed in accordance with the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions are prone to buckling due to a high axial compression force combined with in-plane bending moments caused by the nonuniform distribution of inelastic brace deformations along the frame height. Special design provisions have been introduced in the 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions to address flexural demands imposed on MT-CBF columns and prevent column instability. In this paper, the seismic design methods for multi-tiered special concentrically braced frames are evaluated using the nonlinear finite element analysis method. A two-tiered special concentrically braced frame was then created, and nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were performed to evaluate the seismic performance of both frames. Analysis results confirmed that the inelastic deformations in the frame designed using the 2010 requirements are not uniformly distributed but rather concentrated in one of the tiers and cause column instability under large story drifts, whereas, the 2016 design method significantly improves the distribution of inelastic deformation along the height of the frame and prevents column instability. Furthermore, it was found that the 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions accurately estimate the axial load but overestimate the in-plane flexural demands and underestimates the out-of-plane flexural demand. Nonetheless, the overestimation of in-plane flexure demands results in acceptable strength capacity even though out-of-plane flexural demands is underestimated. © 2020, American Institute of Steel Construction Inc..

AB  - Traditionally, the P3P problem is solved by firstly transforming its 3 quadratic equations into a quartic one, then by locating the roots of the resulting quartic equation and verifying whether a root does really correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem itself. It is well known that a root of the quartic equation could correspond to 2, or 1, or even null solution at all to the P3P problem, and up to now, no explicit relationship between the P3P solution and the root of its quartic equation is available in the literature. In this work, we show that when the optical center is outside of all the 6 toroids defined by the control point triangle, each positive root of the Grunert's quartic equation must correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem, and the corresponding P3P problem cannot have a unique solution, it must have either 2 positive solutions or 4 positive solutions. In addition, we show that when the optical center passes through any one of the 3 toroids among these 6 toroids (except possibly for two concentric circles), the number of the solutions of the corresponding P3P problem always changes by 1, either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. Furthermore we show that such changed solutions always locate in a small neighborhood of control points, hence the 3 toroids are critical surfaces of the P3P problem and the 3 control points are 3 singular points of solutions. A notable example is that when the optical center passes through the outer surface of the union of the 6 toroids from the outside to inside, the number of the solutions must always decrease by 1. Our results are the first in the literature to give an explicit and geometrically intuitive relationship between the P3P solutions and the roots of its quartic equation, aside its academic values, it could also act as some theoretical guidance for P3P practitioners to properly arrange their control points to avoid undesirable solutions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A compact ultra-wideband circular monopole antennas with single, dual, triple and quad-band rejection characteristics are proposed in this paper. The antenna units are designed using RT/DUROID substrate with permittivity 2.2 and all are fed through a coplanar waveguide (CPW). In the proposed antennas splitted concentric rings (SCR) are used to achieve band rejection characteristics. The proposed antennas will reject the existing WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), WiMAX (World Wide Interoperability for Microwave Access), X-band downlink satellite communication and radio-frequency channel arrangements for fixed wireless systems to avoid interference. Simulations are carried out using CST Wave Studio Suite 2016. Antenna performance parameters like return loss, VSWR, radiation pattern and gain are evaluated for all the antenna units. The antenna units having dimensions of 30×23×1.57 mm3 are fabricated and tested. The simulated and tested results are compared and reported. These antenna units provide good gain and a larger bandwidth over the frequency range 3–11.6 GHz. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - It has been suggested that eccentric contraction (EC) is associated with increases in serially arranged sarcomeres (sarcomerogenesis), while concentric contraction (CC) has been associated with serial sarcomeres decrease. Sarcomerogenesis following EC is thought to be a protective muscle adaptation, preventing muscle injury in future eccentric exercise bouts (repeated bout effect). However, the mechanisms underlying sarcomerogenesis in EC remain unknown, and the sarcomerogenic responses observed in response to EC and CC are contradictory. We measured sarcomere length, sarcomere length uniformity, serial sarcomere number, and fascicle length in gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in sedentary (SED) mice, and in mice following protocols of moderate uphill (TRU) and downhill (TRD) training and uphill (OTU) and downhill (OTD) overtraining. We found pain sensitivity after the first bout of EC exercise on TRD and OTD followed by a normalized sensory response after four weeks of training, indicating a repeated bout effect. However, these findings were not associated with sarcomerogenesis, as serial sarcomere numbers did not increase in TRD and OTD skeletal muscle samples compared to controls (SED). However, we found a decrease in serial sarcomere number in VL and TA in OTU group mice, which was associated with a decrease in fascicle length and no change of sarcomere length at the tested joint configuration. We conclude that excessive concentric muscle contraction (OTU group mice), leads to a decrease in serial sarcomere number, while moderate or excessive eccentric training, did not result in sarcomerogenesis, as reported in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study includes the effect of the type of porous medium on the heat transfer enhancement for double-pipe heat exchanger. Using the three types of the porous medium of balls (steel, ceramic and glass) with diameters (6.35, 6 and 7) mm respectively. The tests were carried out on a locally manufactured heat exchanger, consisting of a copper pipe with an inner diameter (20mm), an outer diameter (22mm) and a length of (1800mm), fixed inside a pipe made of galvanized iron with the same length of copper pipe with inner diameter (50mm) and thickness (5mm). The heat exchanger is insulated with a layer of glass wool to prevent leakage of heat to the area surrounding the exchanger. The tests carried out on the heat exchanger in four cases, the three cases for porous medium, also the case of exchanger without porous medium, and for all cases identical operating conditions, which is inlet temperature of hot, and cold water determined at (63 and 32)˚C and the number of Reynolds from (1100 to 9750) for cold water and (415 to 7500) for hot water. The experimental results showed that the highest thermal conductivity was obtained when the ceramic balls were used, which was estimated to be approximately (219.302) W/˚C and increased by (105.3%, 10.8%, 4.3%) for cases: without porous medium, glass balls and steel balls respectively. The effect of the pressure drop in the hot water side, was recorded the highest value for pressure drop when the ceramic balls were used and ranged from (0.5 to 19.5) mmHg and increased by (0.95%, 2.25%) when compared with the results of two cases for balls (steel and glass) respectively. © 2019 TJES, College of Engineering, Tikrit University.

AB  - Force-time (F-T) characteristics of countermovement jump (CMJ) are globally referenced as the main descriptors of athletic jump performance, particularly for volleyball players. Nevertheless, it is still unclear to what extent the vertical jump performance during testing is associated with jump performance during game-like conditions. This study was designed to investigate the association between F‑T curve variables derived from CMJ, including movement timings, force, velocity, power, rate of force development (RFD), modified reactive strength index (RSImod), and net impulse with spike jump height during game-like circumstances. Thirteen young elite volleyball players performed three CMJs and six spike jumps in game-like circumstances. Pearson’s product correlation test portrayed a significant correlation between spike jump height and peak RFD (r = 0.75), average RFD (r = 0.76), RSImod (r = 0.56), and concentric net impulse (r = 0.61). Multiple regression analysis also showed that these factors have a strong contribution for predicting spike jump heights (71%). The findings of this study emphasise the importance of RFD, concentric net impulse, and RSImod values in the precise analysis and prediction of volleyball attackers’ spike jump height during game-like conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Rationale: Social attachment plays an important role in offspring development. Different parenting experiences during lactation may shape offspring behavior and later alcohol use. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that differential rearing conditions (single mother, SM or biparental, BP) in the non-monogamous C57BL/6J mice may affect (1) parental behavior during lactation, (2) adolescent behavior, and (3) adolescent initiation of alcohol drinking. Methods: Mice were reared in SM or BP (cohabitation of father-mother since copulation) condition until weaning (postnatal day, PND, 21). Litters from both conditions were filmed during PNDs 6, 9, and 12 and an ethogram was made taking into account nest-, pup-, or self-directed behaviors. At PNDs, 28–29 adolescent animals were evaluated in a modified version of the concentric square field for measurement of behavioral patterns. Other groups of adolescents were tested in a 4-h daily, two-bottle choice alcohol consumption test (10% alcohol vs. water) during 3 weeks (4 days per week). Results: Single mothers spent less time in the nest, left unattended the nest more times, displayed more self-directed and less pup-directed behaviors than BP parents. SM-reared adolescents displayed more anxiogenic-like and less risk-associated behaviors than BP counterparts. The alcohol consumption test indicated a strong effect of rearing condition. Since the fifth day of test, SM adolescents consumed more quantities of alcohol than BP adolescents. Conclusions: During single-mother parenting, pups are left unattended more often, and during adolescence, these organisms exhibited increased anxiety responses. This behavioral phenotype may act as a risk factor for alcohol initiation during adolescence. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Phosphorus fertilizer use efficiency can be poor in calcareous soils as a result of calcium phosphate precipitation reactions. To avoid crop P deficiency, growers may apply more fertilizer than is agronomically necessary, creating a surplus of P in soil that can erode or leach into nearby waterbodies and promote eutrophication. This study investigated the effects of liquid P fertilizer source, application volume, and co-application of a gelling agent on P partitioning in two mildly calcareous soils from Kansas. Treatments included phosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and an 80% MAP/20% APP mixture applied at one total P rate over two concentrations or co-applied with sodium alginate (AG). Soils were incubated for 4 wk in Petri dishes and then sectioned in concentric rings from the point of application. Anion exchange resin (AER) extractability assessed plant availability and total P determination evaluated diffusion. Sequential extraction and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were implemented to probe reaction products and pathways. Incorporation of polyphosphates, co-application of AG, and dilution with water improved the proportion of P that was AER extractable in the case of monoammonium phosphate from ∼36 to 66, 58, and 65%, respectively. Increased plant availability may be accomplished through a combination of at least two mechanisms: retarded ripening of calcium phosphate minerals into sparingly soluble forms and altered partitioning of P to soil colloids. Understanding the conditions under which these concepts scale to the field could result in increased farm profitability and nutrient use efficiency. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The newly emerged hybrid manufacturing platform that incorporates both additive manufacturing (AM) and five-axis machining modules makes it possible to manufacture parts of complex shapes with high finish-surface quality that are impossible to be produced solely by either machining or additive manufacturing. In general, a hybrid manufacturing process is signified by an alternating sequence of AM operations and machining operations that alternatingly build and machine an in-process workpiece into the final design shape. Aside from other considerations, collision avoidance between the in-process workpiece and both the cutting tool and the material-dispensing nozzle is one of the most critical constraints that affect the determination of the alternating sequence. Due to the newness of hybrid manufacturing technology, currently there has been few systematic studies of this collision avoidance problem in which the obstacles are in a constant state of growing, especially on nozzle collision avoidance which – though never an issue in the traditional 2.5-axis AM because the in-process workpiece is always below the printing nozzle – now becomes a real concern in hybrid manufacturing as the in-process workpiece now dynamically grows and is not constrained by the current build layer. The nozzle collision problem is particularly pronounced in metallic hybrid manufacturing where the nozzle compartment typically is large and has a complex shape. In this paper, we conduct a thorough study of this collision avoidance problem in hybrid manufacturing and present a deterministic algorithm for automatically generating a collision-free sequence of hybrid manufacturing with the least alternations for a solid part. Specifically, as long as the part can be represented in the so-called columnar form, and the build layers are either planar or on concentric conic surfaces, for any given tool and nozzle, our algorithm will automatically generate an alternating sequence of minimum length whose corresponding hybrid manufacturing process is guaranteed to be free of collision with either the tool or nozzle The columnar representation actually embodies a large class of industrial parts such as aero-engine blisks and gears while concentric conic build layers are the most common type of slicing strategy adopted in multi-axis 3D printing. Ample computer simulation tests of the proposed algorithm are performed and the results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A method based on elastic stability analysis to design bolted single shear lap (SSL) connections, which are traditionally used for hollow structural section (HSS) bracing members, is proposed in this paper. The method includes connections with different lap plate thicknesses. An approximate nonlinear analysis method is also presented to mimic the inelastic buckling and post-buckling response of the connections. These approaches are validated by the existing experimental results of three X-bracing specimens and by the numerical results obtained from nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. The results show that the design procedure proposed by the current guidelines for the HSS can be improved using the calculated effective length factor of this study. Lastly, a stiffened SSL connection detail is suggested for X-bracings and is assessed through the employed analytical methods. This detail is efficiently able to prevent the formation of the three-hinge buckling mode in SSL connections by omitting one of the involved plastic hinges. By using this detail, the compression strength of the connections is enhanced to a level that is normally demanded by special concentric braced frames (SCBF). © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This investigation focuses on the performance assessment of a low-cost automotive LIDAR, the Livox Mid-40 series. The work aims to examine the qualities of the sensor in terms of ranging, repeatability and accuracy. Towards these aims a series of experiments were carried out based on previous research of low-cost sensor accuracy, LIDAR accuracy investigation and TLS calibration experiments. The Livox Mid-40 series offers the advantage of a long-range detection beyond 200 m at a remarkably low cost. The preliminary results of the tests for this sensor indicate that it can be used for reality capture purposes such as to obtain coarse as-built plans and volume calculations to mention a few. Close-range experiments were conducted in an indoor laboratory setting. Long-range experiments were performed outdoors towards a building façade. Reference values in both setups were provided with a Leica RTC 360 terrestrial LIDAR system. In the close-range experiments a cross section of the point cloud shows a significant level of noise in the acquired data. At a stand-off distance of 5 m the length measurement tests reveal deviations of up to 11 mm to the reference values. Range measurement was tested up to 130 meters and shows ranging deviations of up to 25 millimetres. The authors recommend further investigation of the issues in radiometric behaviour and material reflectivity. Also, more knowledge about the internal components is needed to understand the causes of the concentric ripple effect observed at close ranges. Another aspect that should be considered is the use of targets and their design as the non-standard scan pattern prevents automated detection with standard commercial software. © Authors 2019.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of buckling restrained brace systems (BRBs) on the overall structural stability against fire following a severe incident, which caused the failure of a column on the first storey of a steel building. A four-storey moment frame fitted with the inverted-V arrangement of braces is modelled, considering a multi-hazard approach. This technique concentrates on a structural plane frame that is designed to meet the progressive collapse criteria according to the U.S. Department of Defense guidelines and assumes that an extreme event damaged a first-storey centre column, before the exposure to an ensuing fire. The performance of BRBs in preventing the global collapse of the structure due to a post-event fire is compared with that of ordinary concentric brace systems (OCBs). The results indicate that BRBs offer a higher global collapse time to the building owing to the greater stiffness they provide to the structural frame. The fire resistance provided by BRBs is restricted to the participation of bracing elements and framing girders afterwards. In the case of OCBs, columns contribute to the structural resistance prior to the full capacity of braces used. To conclude, it is found that BRBs are more capable in maintaining the stability of a damaged building against fire resulting from an extreme event than OCBs. © 2018, Hong Kong Institute of Steel Construction.

AB  - One of the major problems facing the development and road to practical usage of concentric tube continuum robots in surgical environments is that of instability. This issue, also known as the snapping problem, is caused by a tube having a high bending to torsional stiffness ratio (BTSR). Past efforts have shown that by cutting patterns on the tubes, this problem can be avoided. This paper seeks to redesign the topology of the tubes so that BTSR is decreased and the snapping problem is resolved in a particular tube set. The generated designs are then tested through finite element analysis as well as experimental testing to demonstrate the elimination of the snapping problem. Using this novel tube design on a concentric tube robotic system can increase its stable workspace because it allows the usage of greater tube curvatures and/or curve lengths. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Low-ductility steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are widely used in buildings as a lateral resistance system in seismic regions around the world due to their high stiffness and strength. Steel CBF buildings have been observed to have reserve capacity after brace fracture in past earthquakes. However, it is difficult for most practicing engineers to evaluate the contribution of the reserve system to the collapse prevention performance of CBF buildings because of its complex inelastic behavior. This study proposes a method to define the reserve system of multistory low-ductility CBF buildings for earthquake loads by performing a static pushover analysis. The multistory CBF building is converted to an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) CBF system with induced reserve parameters. A simple mathematical model describing the ductility response spectra for the reserve system in moderate seismic regions is established from the results of an extensive parametric study employing the SDOF mode to represent multistory CBF buildings. The collapse prevention capacity of the reserve system for a multistory CBF building can be evaluated by comparing the period of the multistory CBF system with a threshold value. The proposed approach is validated by application to buildings in two case studies. The results demonstrate that the reserve capacity of a multistory CBF plays an important role in collapse prevention. This simplified procedure is intended for a rapid evaluation on the multistory CBF system using an approximate seismic response. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that it's difficult for traditional Canny edge detection operator to extract the lane line features robust in real-time in complex scenes of a large amount of traffic information, an improved method for the optimal direction interval quick detection based on Gabor filter was proposed. First, the panoramic image was expanded into a rectangular image by the concentric circle approximation expansion method. Then the expanded image was processed by Gabor filter with different phases, thus obtaining the direction interval which had the highest clarity of the lane line quickly. In the process of edge detection with Canny operator, only the edge points in the optimal interval were used for non-maximum suppression and further processing. Finally, the algorithm was tested on 500 real images for videos, and the recognition rate could be better than 94.2%. The results show that the proposed method is robust for complex environment and has strong feasibility, which can effectively improve the real-time performance and stability of lane departure warning system. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.

AB  - Although working with contexts is one of the most basic operations of literary criticism (and particularly of cultural literary studies), there is still a definite shortage of theoretical reflection on this question. My essay will first examine the traditional context model of concentric circles (1), then consider the different functions which contexts can have in (cultural) literary studies (2), and discuss how contexts can be selected and how their relevance can be evaluated (3). The last section will try to add at least some practice to these theoretical considerations by looking at two examples (by Schiller and Novalis) from the cultural and literary history of the dream (4). Though much of my argument will be as general as possible, my essay will also try to close a gap which I, personally, have found particularly frustrating in recent debates on the methodology of literary criticism: there is a flagrant disregard of positions which try to situate and understand texts historically within their culture and time and to avoid any form of anachronistic actualization. These positions are not discussed as arising from a distinct method in its own right, there is not even a commonly accepted term for them, they seem, rather, to be beneath contempt - yet they obviously play an important, maybe even a dominant, role in the mainstream of literary studies. If this should be due to a particular abstinence from theory on the side of historicist literary critics, it would be high time for them to end it, as historical literary studies are as worthy of theoretical reflection as they are in need of it. © Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht GmbH & Co.

AB  - Are people biologically prepared for the rapid detection of threat posed by an angry facial expression, even when it is conveyed in the form of a schematic line drawing? Based on visual search times, the current literature would suggest that the answer is yes. But are there lowlevel explanations for this effect? Here, we present visual search results for schematic faces using current best practice, based on a concentric search array and set size manipulation. Using this approach, we replicate the classic search advantage for angry over happy faces. However, we also report a comparable effect when abstract plus- and square-shaped stimuli-derived from the angry and happy schematic faces respectively-are used within the same paradigm. We then go on to demonstrate that, while reduced, the effect remains after removal of the circular surround, bringing us closer to the source of the effect. We explore the possibility that the source of this search asymmetry could be the iso-feature suppression and collinear facilitation model proposed in Li's (1999a, 1999b, and 2002) bottom-up model of saliency. Simulations with this model using the abstract stimuli align with the corresponding behavioral results (i.e., the plus shape was found to be more salient than the square). Given the deliberate similarities between these abstract shapes and the respective face stimuli, we propose that the underlying cause for the asymmetries typically found using schematic faces, may be more related to early visual processing of line orientation than threat detection. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Cyber has become an essential element for governments, militaries and societies. This importance makes it a target when planning a military campaign. The targeting model developed by Colonel John Warden has demonstrated flexibility in that it can be applied to any entity that can be analyzed as a system. Scott Applegate has accurately described three different strategies that can be employed when waging offensive cyber warfare. The targeting model developed by Colonel John Warden can be applied to each of these cyber maneuver strategies to analyse and attack an opponent’s cyber capabilities. There is anecdotal evidence that these different cyber strategies have been employed in recent world conflicts. Real world examples accessed from open source literature have been analysed using Warden’s theory, to demonstrate that countries have already started basing their attacks against their opponent’s cyber capabilities using this model. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Using poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) of two molecular weights and various other polymeric or blend systems, this study has shed a critical clue that cracks are inclined to be guided by interior lamellae via interior inter-lamellae discontinuity and interfaces that exist between the successive ring bands or radial/tangential lamellae. Advanced interior dissection analysis on the aggregated spherulites of several polymers further proves that the cracks occur at the interface between the valley and ridge bands of the ringed spherulites, where interfaces with discontinuous lamellae exist with either impingement or intersection. Propagation of the cracks follows the spiral or circular lamellae assembly into similarly spiral or circular concentric patterns, Such updated views via interior lamellae dissection and analysis on PHB's or other polymers’ banded spherulites provide avenues for cracks to develop upon cooling contraction. The mechanism of spiral/circular cracks’ formation is well proven in this work, which is related to the inner arrangement/assembly of the periodic spiral lamellae into banded types; by contrast, without such lamellae periodicity, cracks tends to be randomly irregular. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim: Hamstring muscle injury is the main injury related to sports requiring sprint acceleration. In addition, hamstring muscles have been reported to play a role in horizontal force production during sprint acceleration performance. The aim of the present study was to analyze (i) the determinants of horizontal force production and (ii) the role of hip extensors, and hamstring muscles in particular, for horizontal force production during repeated sprint-induced fatigue conditions. Method: In this experimental laboratory setting study including 14 sprint-trained male athletes, we analyzed (i) the changes in sprint mechanics, peak torque of the knee and hip extensors and flexors, muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus, and sagittal plane lower limb motion, before and after twelve 6-s sprints separated by 44 s rest on an instrumented motorized treadmill, and (ii) the determinants of horizontal force production (FH) during the sprint acceleration in a fatigue state (after 12 sprints). Results: The repeated-sprint protocol induced a decrease in maximal power output (Pmax) [-17.5 ± 8.9%; effect size (ES): 1.57, large] and in the contact-averaged horizontal force component (FH) (-8.6 ± 8.4%; ES: 0.86, moderate) but not meaningful changes in the contact-averaged resultant (total) force (FTot) (-3.4 ± 2.9%; ES: 0.55, small) and vertical force component (FV) (-3.1 ± 3.2%; ES: 0.49, small). A decrease was found in concentric peak torque of the knee flexors and extensors and in gluteus and vastus lateralis muscle activity during entire swing and end-of-swing phase. An increase was found in contact time and swing time, while step frequency and knee speed before ground contact decreased. Muscular determinants associated with FH and its decrease after the repeated-sprint protocol were concentric peak torque of the hip extensors (p = 0.033) and a decrease in gluteus maximus activity at the end-of-swing (p = 0.007), respectively. Conclusion: Sprint-induced fatigue lead to changes in horizontal force production muscular determinants: hamstring muscle seems not to have the same role than in non-fatigue condition. Horizontal force production seems to be more dependent on the hip extensors and gluteus maximus function. Given the fatigue-induced decrease in hamstring muscle strength, we can hypothesize that muscle compensatory and kinematic strategies reported in a fatigued state could be an adaptation to allow/maintain performance and a protective adaptation to limit hamstring muscles constraints. © Copyright © 2018 Edouard, Mendiguchia, Lahti, Arnal, Gimenez, Jiménez-Reyes, Brughelli, Samozino and Morin.

AB  - In public communication networks such as the internet, users can easily share and access multimedia products such as images, videos, and audios. Copyright protection is a vital issue to prove the ownership of products in these networks. Consequently, digital watermarking that hide invisible watermark or logo plays a significant role in overcoming copyright issue. However, any person has access to multimedia products can simply use these products. Also, there are professional attackers can remove the watermark or logo without loss the visibility of the multimedia product and claim their ownership for the digital products. This study proposes an image watermarking model that only allows authorized users to use the watermarked image. This model is robust against crop and rotation attacks. It is based on the proposed embedding method that we named a »concentric rectangles», which embeds data in rectangles starting from the center toward outer boundary to overcome the crop and rotation attacks. The resulted watermarked image is distorted in such a way to be recognized by any user, but only the authorized one can obtain a high quality of the watermarked image. The experimental results of the proposed model show that the embedding capacity can reach up to 25% from the size of the host image with watermarked image quality above 40 dB in terms of peak signal to noise rotation (PSNR). Furthermore, the proposed model is fully retrieval for the watermark image (logo) and the logo still retrieved a with a recognized vision until 10 dB of signal to noise ratio of noise adding. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Balance training has been shown to be effective in preventing ankle sprainrecurrences in subjects with Lateral Ankle injury (LAI) but the biomechanical and/orneurophysiological pathways underlying the clinical outcomes are still unknown. This study wasconducted to determine if a 12-week balance training intervention can alter the mechanicalcharacteristics in ankles with LAI.Methods: fifty-two recreationally active subjects with LAI were randomized to 4 group (A, B, C, D) Group A control group (n=13) Group B BOSU Exercise training (n=13) Group C Neuromuscular training (n=13) Group D Combined intervention of B+C (n=13) Subjects in the intervention group were trained on the affected limb with static and dynamiccomponents using a training protocol for12-weeks. The ankle joint stiffness andneutral zone in inversion and eversion directions on the involved and uninvolved limbs wasmeasured at baseline, Mid, Post and post follow-up-intervention using a dynamometer. Results: There was significant interaction observed between the group across the experimental trails p=.022). Similarly, there was also a significant effect of time differences observed on muscle strength concentric-eccentric inversion120 degree (p=.000). Similarly, there was also a significant effect of time differences observed on concentric-eccentric eversion at 30 degree per second (p=.000). © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - In this paper a compact semicircular monopole antenna is proposed for UWB applications. Generally UWB antenna operates in the frequency range of (3.1-10.6 GHZ). To avoid interference between UWB and existing wireless communication systems, band rejection characteristics are proposed.In this paper the author has come up with two rejection bands one is WLAN (4.94-5.85 GHZ) and other one is International Telecommunication union (ITU) band (8.0-8.55 GHz). In the proposed work the semi-circular monopole patch antenna is excited with micro strip line feeding. To get required notching bands concentric rings are placed on the patch. The antenna design is simulated using CST microwave studio. Some of the important antenna parameters like Return losses, VSWR, Radiation pattern are measured. © 2020 Mattingley Publishing.

AB  - The understanding of the processes involved in soot formation and oxidation is a critical factor for a reliable prediction of emissions in aero-engines, particularly as legislation becomes increasingly stringent. This work studies the flame structure and soot formation in a lab-scale burner, which reproduces the main features of a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor, using high-fidelity numerical simulations. The investigated burner, developed at the University of Cambridge, is based on a bluff-body swirl-stabilised ethylene flame, with air provided in the primary region through two concentric swirling flows and quenching enabled by means of four dilution jets at variable distance downstream. Measurements for different air split between the two inlet swirling flows and dilution ports, and different height of the dilution jets, indicate noticeable differences in the soot tendency. Numerical simulations have been performed using Large-Eddy Simulation with the Conditional Moment Closure combustion model and a two-equation model for soot, allowing a detailed resolution of the mixing field and to directly take into account the effect of turbulent transport on the flame structure, which has been shown to have an important effect on the soot formation and evolution. The main objective of this work is to study the flow field and mixing characteristics in the burner's primary region, in order to improve the understanding of the mechanisms leading to the soot behaviour observed in the experiment at different operating conditions. Results show the key role of mixing in determining the level of soot in the burner, with the soot production mainly related to the extension of the flame zone characterized by a rich mixture, with pyrolysis products and soot precursors. The presence of additional dilution air seems to improve the oxidation and leads to a leaner mixture in the primary combustion region whereas the air added through the outer swirl stream seems to have less impact on the mixture formation in the primary region. Analysis of the solution in mixture fraction space shows the importance of residence time for the soot formation and highlights the existence of a range of values of mixture fraction, between 0.1 and 0.2, where the soot production terms are maximum. High residence times and local air-to-fuel ratio in the range of high soot production should be avoided to decrease the level of soot mass fraction in the burner. Copyright © 2018 ASME

AB  - Starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin and deposited as granules of different sizes and shapes with semi-crystalline and amorphous concentric layers that show the ‘maltese cross’. Starches from different sources show variable chemical composition as well as the structure of their components that are involved in thermal properties. Amylose, lipids, phosphorylated residues and long lateral chain amylopectin interact among them avoiding water uptake. In contrast, high amylopectin contents, especially with short lateral chains, allow hydration via hydrogen bonds to form gels with the tendency to retrogradation. Smaller starch granules have a larger superficial area, surface pores, and channels that enhance water uptake. High hydration increases the swelling, viscosity, and gelatinization ability of starch granules. The knowledge of those properties allows the selection of the most appropriate starch for a specific end use. This review discusses the relationship between the physicochemical composition of the starch and their rheological properties. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Unstable fracture-dislocations of the elbow, and in particular the "terrible triad" injury consisting of an elbow dislocation with a fracture of the radial head and coronoid, are complex injuries that can be plagued and complicated by persistent instability. Acute and chronic instability is a difficult problem and is best managed early by avoidance and restoration of stability. A number of treatment options have been proposed to manage acute postfixation instability of the elbow joint. Traditional stabilization options include immobilization with splinting or casting, cross-articular pinning, and external fixation (hinged or static), followed by early physical therapy. However, each of these approaches can still yield persistent elbow instability. We are proposing a new technique of acute but temporary bridge plate stabilization of the elbow joint to protect the concentrically reduced elbow joint following repair of all injured structures to restore stability followed by staged removal and the delayed initiation of therapy. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Butterflies often use their dorsal and ventral wing color patterns for distinct signaling functions. Color patterns on hidden dorsal wing surfaces are often used in sexual signaling, while exposed ventral patterns are often used to ward off predator attacks. At rest, however, part of the ventral forewings are often hidden by the hindwings, allowing individuals to also use the patterns on this wing surface for sexual signaling. Here, we test this hypothesis in Bicyclus anynana (Butler, Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) butterflies by first determining the degree of sexual dimorphism in ventral forewing patterns, focusing on the eyespots, from both wet and dry season forms, and then testing the role of the larger ventral forewing eyespots of dry season females in male mate choice. We also test male investment in reproduction. We show that ventral forewing UV-reflective eyespot centers, in addition to dorsal forewing eyespot centers previously examined in this species, play a role in sexual signaling as males preferentially mated with females with their ventral eyespot centers intact instead of blocked with black paint. This male preference, however, did not translate into a detectable higher reproductive investment via a single mating toward ornamented females. This study provides an example of how ventral forewing patterns, often hidden by hindwings, are used in sexual communication, in this case by females to attract males. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Studies of heparin effects on Lepidoptera wing patterns have been restricted to a small number of species. I report observations from experiments on a broader range of taxa, including first results from swallowtails, tiger moths and microlepidoptera. Methods: Heparin injections were made in prepupal and early pupal stages of the following species representing several Lepidoptera lineages: Junonia coenia, Agraulis vanillae, Asterocampa clyton (Nymphalidae); Heraclides cresphontes, Pterourus troilus, Eurytides marcellus (Papilionidae); Hypercompe scribonia, Estigmene acrea, Hyphantria cunea (Erebidae); and Glyphodes sibillalis (Crambidae). Heparin-induced changes in wing pattern are illustrated, and advantages of using prepupal vs. pupal stages for this type of pharmacological manipulation of wing patterns are discussed. Results: In buckeyes, heparin-induced changes consisted of loss of orange parafocal elements as marginal and submarginal bands shifted basally. In gulf fritillaries, changes in black and silver markings were similar to those found in wild aberrant individuals. In tawny emperor, intermediate and extreme levels of transformation were achieved, pointing to homology of this species’ unusual eyespots to those of other nymphalids. In swallowtails, heparin-induced changes were much more restricted and proved harder to achieve, possibly indicating higher levels of stability and compartmentalization of wing patterns in this butterfly family. In tiger moths, elongation of black markings occurred so that normally distinct spots sometimes merged; in leopard moth, these changes were restricted to areas adjacent to discal spot. In pyraloid moth, changes were mostly restricted to expansion of wing marginal bands and hindwing border. Conclusions: Variation in wing pattern response to heparin found between different species and families in this study warrants further taxonomic widening of exploration of wing pattern formation mechanisms in Lepidoptera. While there are many similarities, there also seem to be very significant differences in the ways wing patterns are formed in different families of butterflies and moths. © 2018 Sourakov A.

AB  - The modern distribution of the western Eurasian sub-boreal butterfly species Coenonympha leander (Esper, 1784) was studied in the Urals region, with the northeastern range limits specified at 56° N and 65° E. There are isolated local C. leander populations in the forested steppe, while in the steppe zone the species is distributed fairly uniformly. In the Urals steppes, the species is tolerant to moderate anthropogenic transformations of natural communities, being not too rare. Nor can it serve as an indicator species like in other parts of the range. The geographic variations of the wing length, as well as the diameters and frequency of wing pattern eyespots are analyzed. The greatest morphological peculiarities are distinguished in the marginal outpost populations, especially the northernmost population from Nizhneye Tukbaevo, Bashkortostan, which lives in the unique conditions of the azonal Mesyagutovo forested steppe and tends to form a cline from north to south: the size of the wings is decreased, while the diameter of the eyespots and the frequency of their occurrence are increased. © 2019 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

AB  - The mixture of CO2 and superheated steam (SHS) has been proved effective for heavy oil recovery by field practices. It has been proved that the development effect is closely related to the state parameters (temperature, pressure and superheated degree etc.) of the mixture. As a result, wellbore modeling is an important branch in the study of thermal recovery of heavy oil. In recent years, concentric dual-tube wells (CDTW) coupled with multi-point injection technique (MPIT) is proposed to overcome the fingering phenomenon, induced by serious reservoir heterogeneity, during the steam injection process. In this paper, a wellbore model is developed for simulating CO2 & SHS flow in a full-length CDTW. The model is solved with finite difference method on space. It is found that: (a) An injection pressure, higher than 4.1 MPa, in the integral joint tube (IJT) or an injection pressure, smaller than 4.1 MPa, in annuli are recommended to obtain a uniform steam absorption rate along the horizontal wellbores. (b) The mass injection rate at well-head condition should be close to each other to avoid un-uniform of steam absorption rate along the horizontal wellbores. (c) When phase change occurs in the annuli, the mixture temperature increases with increasing CO2 content. (d) The total length of wet steam flow in the horizontal section of the wellbores increases with increasing CO2 content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, homogeneous gripping mechanical devices for connecting small-sized modular autonomous robots are described. The review of solutions of gripping and holding industrial mechanisms, and robotic switching mechanisms, as well as docking devices of space vehicles is given. The design of the connecting gripping mechanism of Mobile Autonomous Reconfigurable System (MARS) for coaxial conjugation of robots is proposed and it works in conjunction and passive modes to form modular structures. In the passive state, the working body of the mechanism forms a geometrical figure, which is suitable for connecting with identical device. In this case working body opens gripping mechanism and capture similar mechanism in the passive state. The proposed mechanism is based on the iris diaphragm, which prevents the uncontrolled displacement of the working body and stops the mechanism. It excludes the accidental rotation around the axis of the autonomous unit during operation in the formed structure. Infrared sensors (IR) were used for the concentric alignment of the axes of the connection devices. Sensors of this type estimate the distance and deflection angle of the opposed mechanism. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - In complex low altitude airspace, some factors may cause that flight information cannot interact properly between UAVs. UAV cannot normally obtain flight information of others within its communication range. Therefore, we propose a distributed approach to multi-aircraft real-time conflict resolution. UAVs can enhance the ability of autonomous conflict resolution through the study of preorder flight information with the prerequisite for the unavailability of others' flight information. First, we obtain the payoff of safety and efficiency adopting speed and heading adjustments as maneuver strategy of collision avoidance. Then, according to the preorder flight information, UAV builds a memory pool which is learned by it to obtain the most rewarding collision avoidance strategy. Finally, the simulation results on the random flight scenario of two concentric circles show that our approach is promising in terms of safety and system efficiency. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This research presents a study of the behavior of built-up compressed steel members composed of concentric hot rolled circular hollow sections. The use of these members is an innovative solution of practical interest for situations in which a single member does not reach the required compressive strength. Some technically and economically viable design and fabrication solutions to built-up members composed of concentric hot rolled circular hollow sections are presented. For the validation of numerical results, models of singular hollow sections are made and compared to the EN 1993-1-1, and the results obtained with numerical models were satisfactory. The compression resistance of these numerical models differs less than 9% from the EN 1993-1-1 values. Once the numerical modeling was validated, the study of built-up members was made, considering the tubes always united at the extremities by end plates, and along the length by fixed interconnections or sliding interconnections or, furthermore, without interconnections. For these three different conditions, several numerical models using FEM via Abaqus software were simulated to obtain and compare the compression resistance. The results show that these built-up sections with fixed and sliding interconnections have very similar behavior to the results obtained with European Standard procedure, when considering equivalent areas and inertias for the built-up section. Also, it shows that this observation does not apply to the sections without interconnections. Comparative graphs of compression resistance curves were generated, as also some graphs that show the distribution of the compressive force between each member of the built-up section. Finally, a formulation for the design of built-up sections without interconnections along the tubes was proposed to avoid robust computational methods. © 2018 Brazilian Association of Computational Mechanics.

AB  - The influence of pulse durations (35fs and 260 fs) and environments (air and vacuum) on the laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDTs) and ablation rates of 304 stainless steel were studied. Two distinct ablation regimes were obtained from the ablation rate curves. At low fluence regime, the ablation rates were similar in spite of the differences of pulse durations and experiment environments. At high fluence regime, the ablation rates of 35 fs pulse duration in vacuum were obviously higher than others. The ablation craters showed smooth edges, moth-eye such as structures, and laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs). At a fixed fluence, the periods of LIPSSs decreased monotonously in their mean spatial period between ~ 700 nm (5 pulses) and 540 nm (200 pulses) with the increase of pulse numbers in air with 35 fs pulse duration. The formation mechanisms of moth-eye like structures and LIPSSs were also discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preseason isokinetic strength measures were predictive of future HSI among professional football players. Design: Prospective cohort study, Level of evidence 2. Methods: A total of 169 professional players participated in a preseason isokinetic strength screening, followed by a 10-month competitive season. Testing protocol included the concentric performance of both knee flexion and extension at 60 deg s−1 and 240 deg s−1 and the eccentric performance of the knee flexor at 30 deg s−1. Strength deficits, bilateral differences, and hamstring to quadriceps strength ratios were computed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify potential risk factors of HSI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the strength measures. Results: Forty-one acute HSIs were sustained, and 12% (n = 5) reoccurred within the study period. In the multivariate analysis, we have shown an association between the injury risk and eccentric hamstring peak torque below 2.4 N m kg−1 (OR = 5.59; 95% CI, 2.20–12.92); concentric H/Q ratio below 50.5% (OR = 3.14; 95% CI, 1.37–2.22); players with previous injury of HSI (OR = 3.57; 95% CI, 3.13–8.62). ROC analysis displayed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.77, indicating fair combined sensitivity and specificity of the overall predicting model. Conclusions: Professional football players with significant lower isokinetic hamstring strength, lower hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratio, and a previous injury of HSI were linked to an increased risk of acute HSI. © 2017 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - This rotary engine comprises a cylindrical chamber inside a casing wherein there is a concentric rotatable power shaft and a rotatable asymmetric main wheel mounted eccentrically enough as such to avoid contact with the wall of cylindrical chamber. In addition, two bars traversing the main wheel radially further have a wiping contact with the cylindrical chamber wherein one bar is fixed with power shaft and other bar is hinged with said power shaft. A combustion process is in detonation phase within a demarcated combustion chamber whereby the combustion chamber rotatably travels from a bottom dead volume to a top dead volume, and hence, a power, generated during this path of rotational travel, is subsequently available for delivery at the concentric power shaft. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - An annulus is, informally, a ring-shaped region, often described by two concentric circles. The maximum-width empty annulus problem asks to find an annulus of a certain shape with the maximum possible width that avoids a given set of n points in the plane. This problem can also be interpreted as the problem of finding an optimal location of a ring-shaped obnoxious facility among the input points. In this paper, we study square and rectangular variants of the maximum-width empty anuulus problem, and present first nontrivial algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms run in and time for computing a maximum-width empty axis-parallel square and rectangular annulus, respectively. Both algorithms use only O(n) space. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Butterfly eyespot color patterns are traditionally explained by the gradient model, where positional information is stably provided by a morphogen gradient from a single organizer and its output is a set of non-graded (or graded) colors based on pre-determined threshold levels. An alternative model is the induction model, in which the outer black ring and the inner black core disk of an eyespot are specified by graded signals from the primary and secondary organizers that also involve lateral induction. To examine the feasibility of these models, we analyzed eyespot color gradients, boundary scales, and rudimentary eyespots in various nymphalid butterflies. Most parts of eyespots showed color gradients with gradual or fluctuating changes with sharp boundaries in many species, but some species had eyespots that were composed of a constant color within a given part. Thus, a plausible model should be flexible enough to incorporate this diversity. Some boundary scales appeared to have two kinds of pigments, and others had “misplaced” colors, suggesting an overlapping of two signals and a difficulty in assuming sharp threshold boundaries. Rudimentary eyespots of three Junonia species revealed that the outer black ring is likely determined first and the inner yellow or red ring is laterally induced. This outside-to-inside determination together with the lateral induction may favor the induction model, in which dynamic signal interactions play a major role. The implications of these results for the ploidy hypothesis and color-pattern rules are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) outer capsid is composed of 200 1-3 heterohexamers and a maximum of 12 1 trimers. During cell entry, 3 is degraded by luminal or intracellular proteases to generate the infectious subviral particle (ISVP). When ISVP formation is prevented, reovirus fails to establish a productive infection, suggesting proteolytic priming is required for entry. ISVPs are then converted to ISVP*s, which is accompanied by 1 rearrangements. The 1 and 3 proteins confer resistance to inactivating agents; however, neither the impact on capsid properties nor the mechanism (or basis) of inactivation is fully understood. Here, we utilized T1L/T3D M2 and T3D/T1L S4 to investigate the determinants of reovirus stability. Both reassortants encode mismatched subunits. When 1-3 were derived from different strains, virions resembled wild-type particles in structure and protease sensitivity. T1L/T3D M2 and T3D/T1L S4 ISVPs were less thermostable than wild-type ISVPs. In contrast, virions were equally susceptible to heating. Virion associated 1 adopted an ISVP*-like conformation concurrent with inactivation; 3 preserves infectivity by preventing 1 rearrangements. Moreover, thermostability was enhanced by a hyperstable variant of 1. Unlike the outer capsid, the inner capsid (core) was highly resistant to elevated temperatures. The dual layered architecture allowed for differential sensitivity to inactivating agents. IMPORTANCE Nonenveloped and enveloped viruses are exposed to the environment during transmission to a new host. Protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions stabilize the particle and protect the viral genome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is composed of two concentric, protein shells. The 1 and 3 proteins form the outer capsid; contacts between neighboring subunits are thought to confer resistance to inactivating agents. We further investigated the determinants of reovirus stability. The outer capsid was disrupted concurrent with the loss of infectivity; virion associated 1 rearranged into an altered conformation. Heat sensitivity was controlled by 3; however, particle integrity was enhanced by a single 1 mutation. In contrast, the inner capsid (core) displayed superior resistance to heating. These findings reveal structural components that differentially contribute to reovirus stability. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In general, governance aims to coordinate relations of complex interdependence through continuing dialogue to promote negotiated consent, resource sharing, and concerted action without excessive reliance on markets or top-down command. Inside the European Union (EU), it mainly takes the form of multi-level governance based on continuing efforts to identify mutually beneficial joint projects from a wide range of possible projects, redefine them as circumstances change, monitor progress in relation to agreed objectives, mobilize resources controlled by different actors, and organize the material, social, and temporal conditions required to achieve them. In its external relations, EU governance occurs in the shadow of hierarchy in the sense that the relation is asymmetrical and EU institutions and member states hold the upper hand in setting the terms for inclusion of other economies or access to benefits from the EU. In many ways, the EU’s development has been a project to transform the geostrategic dynamics in post-war Europe by converting the troubled relations between rival states and economies from one of political enmity and zero-sum competition into forms of partnership. Two key steps in this regard concern transforming the domestic regimes in post-dictatorial Southern Europe and transforming the regimes in Central Eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin wall. The key mechanism in both cases was conditional inclusion, i.e. integration based on meeting specific criteria and targets. The same public philosophy has underpinned the EU’s external policy - especially in its immediate “neighbourhood” - with a view to including external partner countries into the EU’s internal policy framework based on their commitment to, and implementation of specific reforms. This would be a stepwise process as partner countries are drawn more closely into concentric circles of EU governance (Zielonka, 2006). The policy umbrella for conducting relations between the EU and sixteen of its neighbours in Eastern Europe as well as in Southern Mediterranean, the European Neighbourhood Policy, became the most ambitious “external governance project” (Lavenex, 2004; Lavenex and Schimmelfennig, 2010) or “governance export” policy (Gänzle, 2009). Depicted in the famous phrase of “sharing everything but institutions” (Prodi, 2002), which in practical terms foremost refers to shared market space, shared regulatory framework and political dialogue. At the core of this form of relations remains the EU single market: the biggest carrot offered to partner countries being a stake in the common market, which implies trade liberalization while adopting the norms, rules and regulations of EU’s complex acquis communautaire (Buschle, 2014). Analogous to EU relations with other neighbouring countries, the bilateral relations between the EU and Ukraine envisioned a deep and comprehensive free trade area based on Ukraine’s adoption of norms and regulations of EU’s complex acquis communautaire. In this sense, “sharing everything but institutions” (Prodi, 2002) refers mostly to market liberalization: around 80% of the Association Agreement is formed by trade-related provisions (van der Loo, 2016) and the (legislative, human, financial and technical) resources dedicated to this area by far outnumber any other field of cooperation. Nonetheless, although governance is supposed to provide better ways of dealing with complex problems and to avoid issues of market and state failure, it is not immune to its own crisis tendencies. I illustrate this from the crisis in and/or of EU-Ukraine relations. This challenged the inherited policy approach to governance based on conditional, stepwise inclusion. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Bob Jessop and Karim Knio; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The built-up special concentrically braced frames (BSCBFs) containing double-angle and double-channel braces are among the common steel structural systems resisting lateral loads. In this paper, the parameters influencing the BSCBF seismic behaviours are investigated under cyclic loading. For this purpose, nonlinear finite element analyses of a single-bay single-story frame are employed, and the results show that increasing the number of stitches or decreasing their distances along the length of the built-up members may not necessarily improve the behaviour of the braced systems. That is, inelastic deformation concentration probably occurs in individual elements between stitches, resulting in earlier failure of braces. Moreover, the failure results of the built-up brace members display that the usage of vertical stitch connectors (parallel to the webs) should be avoided in all BSCBF systems in comparison with lateral-stitch braces (parallel to the flanges). In addition, the failure results of double-channel back-to-back BSCBFs are much better than those of similar face-to-face ones. The results of the double-angle diagonal braces also reveal that the failures of the back-to-back brace sections occur earlier in comparison with similar face-to-face or toe-to-toe braces. © 2018, © 2018 Engineers Australia.

AB  - Body fossils are described for the first time from the Upper Brioverian (Ediacaran–Fortunian) deposits of Central Brittany (NW France). The material consists of a dozen of specimens preserved on two slates, recently collected in a quarry in Saint-Gonlay. The fossils, centimetric in size, have an elliptical and acuminated outline, with a peripheral bulge but without conspicuous concentric or radial lines. These body fossils are preserved in slates that are locally rich in grazing traces, sometimes associated with microbial mats. The sedimentological characteristics of these deposits correspond to a shallow marine shelf environment, with a low to moderate hydrodynamism. Such findings, in concomitance with previous ichnological discoveries, unravel the potential of the Brioverian strata from Brittany as a new locality to provide answers on Ediacaran and early Cambrian biocenoses. © 2018 Lethaia Foundation.

AB  - Plot-based data collection is an important component of quantitative ecological research and is widely used. Some of the most extensive plot-networks can be found in country-wide forest inventories, which provide critical information about the state of forest ecosystems. While sampling designs for forest inventories have been well studied, plot design and installation has received less attention. The New Zealand National Forest Inventory of natural forest uses a nested plot design with a 0.126 ha circular plot superimposed concentrically on a 0.04 ha square plot. Stems ≥ 60 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) are measured in the circular plot while stems ≥ 2.5 DBH are measured in the square plot. Stem density of ≥60 cm DBH stems measured in the circular plots were compared with those from square plots. Stem densities estimated from square plot measurements were 23.7% higher than those estimated from circular plot measurements in the 2002–2007 inventory, and 18.4% higher in the 2009–2014 inventory. The main cause of this discrepancy appears to be due to the placement of plot boundaries during establishment of square plots. This effect may have resulted from a subconscious tendency of field teams to include large trees inside plots when laying out these boundaries. It is concluded that estimates from the circular plots are unlikely to be biased while those from the square plots are positively biased. This study highlights the critical importance of plot design and plot placement in forest inventories to ensure that estimates of stand attributes are unbiased. Especially on undulating or uneven terrain, methods of determining whether trees are inside or outside plot boundaries of circular plots are likely to be more accurate than those typically used for square or rectangular plots. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Based on a database of 342 experimental results with a wide range of influencing parameters, a new empirical model was developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for predicting the concentric punching shear strength of RC slab-column connections, without shear reinforcement, and was presented in this paper. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and international codes of practice as well as a state-of-the-art approach were also employed for comparison purpose. To avoid the over-fitting problem, the ten-fold cross-validation method was used to evaluate the performances in prediction. Finally, by using reliability analysis, the safety of these formulations evaluated in terms of safety indexes was also conducted in this comparison. The results indicated that the authors’ approach developed using MLR provided the best combination of accuracy, simplicity, and safety for computation of the punching shear strength. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Two-dimensional flow around semi-circular cylinder at zero angle of attack and at Re = 50000 during the self-oscillatory regime has been extensively studied within the URANS method with the use of different-structure grids (multiblock, structured overlapping, unstructured composite), the SST turbulence model and its versions (1993) and (2003) considering the streamline curvature influence modified within the Rodi–Leschziner–Isaev approach and numerical different-approximation methods realized in two codes (VP2/3, Fluent). Experiments have been made on flow around a semi-circular cylinder in the wind tunnel of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, Institute of Mechanics to obtain data for verification of numerical predictions. The double-mode character of a periodic time history of a drag force caused by a periodically forming and disappearing jet flap and acting upon a body is explained. With increasing compressibility at a Mach number ranging from 0 to 0.5, it is observed that periodic flow around the semi-circular cylinder is restructured, and the time history of the drag force acting upon it is described by a dependence close to a sinusoidal one. It is found that, as the Mach number is increased, pressure field distortions in the form of concentric cylindrical waves propagating from the semi-circular cylinder and the vortex street behind it grow over the infrasonic range. © 2017 IAA

AB  - Steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) is a typical kind of dual system. It is difficult to evaluate the seismic performance of CBFs because of the complex feature of restoring force of CBFs which contains a substantial decrease in strength and stiffness after brace failure subjected to strong earthquake loads. To solve this problem, the concept and assessment procedure of reserve capacity parameters of multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) CBFs were presented. Pushover analysis was performed to transform the MDOF structure to the SDOF system and the structural failure mode was identified. The reserve capacity parameters representing strength and stiffness ratios between reserve system and primary system were also established. A simplified procedure for estimating the collapse performance, ductility and displacement response of MDOF CBFs with reserve capacity was constructed combining with the ductility demand spectra. This method is called 'reserve capacity method'. A reasonable accuracy was demonstrated by comparing the results of ductility demands and roof displacements of proposed method with the results obtained by non-linear dynamic analyses of two 5-story test buildings. The results show that the reserve capacity method is capable of predicting seismic performance of MDOF CBFs. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures. All right reserved.

AB  - Ring-shaped SiC ceramics used in sliding components were examined herein. Conventional lapping generates many shallow scratches in random directions in the surface of such SiC ceramics, and these starches extend from the inner circumference of the surface to its perimeter. The scratches affect the ability of the surface to prevent liquid from escaping from the perimeter side to the inner-circumference side of the SiC ring, and they can increase the friction force of the finished surface as a sliding material. We propose concentric mutual lapping to remove the scratches caused by conventional lapping. The surface topography of a SiC ring is evaluated quantitatively using a white light interferometer, and a vector and quantitative analysis of the surface profile is proposed. The results show that concentric mutual lapping can quickly remove the scratches caused by conventional lapping, and subsequently, circumferential scratches are generated along the lapping direction. We have also conducted sliding tests to analyze the effect of surface topography on the surface function as a sliding material. The results reveal that concentric mutual lapping suppresses the differences in surface function that occurred depending on the sliding direction. © 2019, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a general mechanistic model of mass diffusion for a composite sphere placed in a large ambient medium. The multi-layer problem is described by a system of diffusion equations coupled via interlayer boundary conditions such as those imposing a finite mass resistance at the external surface of the sphere. While the work is applicable to the generic problem of heat or mass transfer in a multi-layer sphere, the analysis and results are presented in the context of drug kinetics for desorbing and absorbing spherical microcapsules. We derive an analytical solution for the concentration in the sphere and in the surrounding medium that avoids any artificial truncation at a finite distance. The closed-form solution in each concentric layer is expressed in terms of a suitably-defined inverse Laplace transform that can be evaluated numerically. Concentration profiles and drug mass curves in the spherical layers and in the external environment are presented and the dependency of the solution on the mass transfer coefficient at the surface of the sphere analyzed. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The current scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature-based watermarking method proposed by Kawamura and Uchida was evaluated using Information Hiding Criteria (IHC) ver. 5. The marked regions were selected around the SIFT feature points then normalized to a uniform size against scaling attack, and watermarks were embedded into these normalized regions. There are two problems with this method. One is that the marked regions are distorted by normalization. The other is that the feature points are not detectable due to embedding on the points. Therefore, we propose an improved version of this method to solve these problems. We introduce two improvements called as a gradual magnification factor for normalization and concentric square regions for marked regions. The proposed method was evaluated using IHC ver. 5, and the feature detection rate improved and the bit error rate decreased. © 2018 APSIPA organization.

AB  - Background: Female adolescent Sepak takraw players have a 3 times higher incidence of knee injury than male. The Prevent Injury Enhance Performance (PEP) program have the potential to significantly reduce knee injury incidence rate via biomotor ability improving. It was applied to train in various group but the effectiveness in adolescent female athlete rarely knew. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the PEP in reducing injury incidence rates among adolescent female Sepak takraw players. Materials and Methods: The PEP and control group was fifty-two female adolescent Sepak takraw players aged 14 to 19 years who were randomly assigned into 2 groups. During warm up period, PEP group was trained 3 times in a week for 8 weeks; in contrast, control group was trained no specialized program. Their muscle power and strength, agility, and flexibility were assessed at baseline, at 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. At 6 months after training, number and characteristics of injuries in both groups were measured by the Orthopedics. Results: Incidence rate on average of PEP and control groups was about 5.32 and 15.96/100,000 AEs. The highest injury was killer, followed by server and feeder. Chondromalacia patella was mostly found, followed by complete tear of ACL, muscle soreness, and higher than control group. Hyperextension and twist mechanism were causative factor for both groups. The result of biomotor ability was found PEP group had a significantly different peak power and jump height higher than control group (p<0.001). There was the significant difference of conventional concentric knee ratios between groups (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our findings indicated the PEP program effectively reduce knee injury, resulting from the strategy could improve the biomotor ability. © JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND| 2019.

AB  - Alternating Current (AC) interference affects pipelines collocated near high voltage transmission lines. While overhead high voltage transmission line collocations are common, underground high voltage transmission line collocations, while less common, can cause similar interference effects on pipelines. This paper describes the feasibility evaluation of a proposed 35 km underground transmission line route in the United Kingdom affecting a nearby pipeline. The proposed transmission line was to consist of either three 220 kV circuits or six 132 kV circuits; both cases were evaluated. The proposed transmission line phase cables were to be installed with concentric sheath conductors, direct buried in a close trefoil configuration, and bonded to underground splice boxes at various locations. In addition to the proposed transmission line route, the project evaluated a set of base cases: a typical pipeline paralleling at varying offsets for various lengths under a variety of operating conditions and a typical pipeline crossing scenario. The effect of soil resistivity on the interference levels experienced by the pipeline was considered. The feasibility study assessed the expected steady state, fault state, and AC corrosion effects that the proposed transmission line could have on any nearby pipelines. Results for all cases and scenarios will be discussed. © 2019 by NACE International.

AB  - Temperature sensitive, frozen food transportation and storage at low temperature is being viewed as a critical issue worldwide as it is related to the changing lifestyle and growing population of the people. The aim of this project is to propose a flask that can be used for cold chain supplies by incorporating a Phase Change Material (PCM) which has low freezing temperature. It is mainly focused to aid the end customers, to whom this flask will be more accessible while travelling and will act as a replacement to dry ice and gel packs. The flask design is a three layered hollow concentric cylinder with the outermost layer filled with insulation, the middle layer with encapsulated PCM tubes and the innermost is where the low temperature product is to be stored. A seal is provided on the top of the body is used to hold the PCM and avoid its leakage. The final portion which makes up the flask is the cap. The PCM selected is SAVE OM03 with properties like melting point of 3.5°C, liquid density of 835 kg/n3 and solid density of 935 kg/n3. The latent heat of this PCM is 240 KJ/kg, having such a huge latent heat makes the PCM to maintain its surrounding temperature for a longer time during its phase change from solid to liquid. Polypropylene (PP) test tubes of diameter 15mm and height 100mm are used for PCM encapsulation. The insulation material used for the flask is polyurethane because of its low thermal conductivity of 0.033 W/n2K. Based on the theoretical studies, the flask diameter is taken as 114mm and the overall height is taken as 200mm. The method adopted for manufacturing this flask is 3D printing and the material used for the flask body is Polylactic acid. Finally, experimental study was carry out, to determine how long a product would be maintained at a low temperature in this flask and for this the PCM was freeze for about 48 hours and was placed in the flask. Several trials were taken and it was found that this PCM oriented flask could maintain a product at low temperature for about 6 hours. © 2018 IAEME Publication.

AB  - The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), located in central Mexico, saw completion of the final construction phase in 2017 with the installation of the full 50-meter primary reflector, following three years of operation as a 32-meter facility. The task was accomplished by adding two more concentric rings of surface segments to the existing three inner rings. Various techniques have been used previously to measure and align the 32-meter surface, including multiple laser trackers and far-field phased holography. Whilst the former method is time-consuming, requiring a full night to obtain a single surface map, holography provides low spatial resolution and requires removal of the secondary reflector for installation of the twin-horn receiver at the primary focus. Photogrammetry has been used as an alternative measurement technique for the 32-m primary since 20151, and has gradually replaced our use of holography and laser trackers for this task2 during recent years. Once the object has been targeted, photogrammetry maps may be obtained in around one hour. The technique does not require the installation of special equipment on the antenna, and has the advantage of allowing surface maps to be taken at any chosen elevation. The main drawbacks for the LMT application are environmental, since the antenna operates without an enclosure; strong winds may prevent use of the site tower crane for image taking, while the formation of condensation and frost on the reflector surface will "switch off" the reflective targets. In this paper we discuss comparative measurements taken as the first outer segments were installed, and the use of photogrammetry to carry out the alignment of the fully installed 50-meter surface. At the time of writing this activity is still in progress, however full-surface alignment to the order of just over 100 microns was achieved quite quickly, with multiple elevation maps allowing the development of a usable 50-m active surface model for compensation of gravitational distortions. ©2018 SPIE.

AB  - We propose a distributed approach to multi-Aircraft real-Time conflict resolution based on satisficing game theory which considers reducing flight collisions and improving economic efficiency. In our conflict game model, aircraft as exclusively self-interested agent are assigned different statuses by a priority ranking mechanism proposed. According to the state of one's own priority, they take others' preferences into consideration to choose the most satisficing conflict resolution strategy from policy set including speed and heading modification strategies. The simulation results on the random flight scenario of two concentric circles show that our method which adopts speed and heading adjustment to avoid conflicts is promising in terms of safety and system efficiency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is the raw material for selection that is ubiquitous for most traits in natural populations, yet the processes underlying phenotypic evolution or stasis often remain unclear. Here, we report phenotypic evolution in a mutant line of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana after outcrossing with the genetically polymorphic wild type population. The comet mutation modifies two phenotypic traits known to be under sexual selection in this butterfly: the dorsal forewing eyespots and the pheromone-producing structures. The original comet mutant line was inbred and remained phenotypically stable for at least seven years, but when outcrossed to the wild type population the outcrossed comet line surprisingly recovered the wild type phenotype within 8 generations at high (27 °C), but not at low (20 °C), developmental temperatures. Male mating success experiments then revealed that outcrossed comet males with the typical comet phenotype suffered from lower mating success, while mating success of outcrossed comet males resembling wild types was partially restored. We document a fortuitous case where the addition of genetic polymorphism around a spontaneous mutation could have allowed partial restoration of phenotypic robustness. We further argue that sexual selection through mate choice is likely the driving force leading to phenotypic robustness in our system. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Colorful feathers have long been assumed to be conspicuous to predators, and hence likely to incur costs due to enhanced predation risk. However, many mammals that prey on birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors, rather than the three and four photoreceptors characteristic of humans and most birds, respectively. Here, we use a combination of multispectral imaging, reflectance spectroscopy, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators from multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus), as well as red and yellow parrot feathers. We also model the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by birds against green vegetation, most of the feathers studied are estimated to have color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. On the other hand, for dichromat mammalian predators, visual contrasts for these feathers were only weakly detectable and often below detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We also show that for dichromat mammal vision models, the peacock’s train has below-detection threshold color and brightness contrasts and visual textures that match various foliage backgrounds. These findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue to those studied here being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of common mammalian predators of adult birds. Given that birds perform many conspicuous motions and behaviors, this study suggests that mammalian predators are more likely to use other sensory modalities (e.g., motion detection, hearing, and olfaction), rather than color vision, to detect avian prey. This suggests new directions for future behavioral studies and emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the sensory ecology of predators in the evolution of animal coloration. © 2019 Kane et al.

AB  - Material signals in the form of surface topographies, proved to be potent regulators of cell functions and fate, through mechanotransduction pathways. While a wealth of data is related to regular topographic patterns, i.e., lines, pit, or protrusions, there are comparatively few studies addressing the effects of circular, concentric patterns. Yet, curvatures affecting cell shape dramatically alter cell contractility and behavior. Additionally, the vast majority of patterned surfaces are static in nature and this prevents to understand how cells perceive and respond to the topographic patterns. Here, a technique is exploited for dynamically embossing micrometerscale circular pattern on azopolymeric substrates using a confocal laser microscope and it is analyzed how NIH-3T3 reacts to the underlying topography in terms of changes in shape and mechanical properties. A characteristic pattern arrangement is found which most effectively alters cell morphology and orientation. Cells perceive the concentric pattern and reconfigure as fast as 2 h after pattern inscription. The changes in morphology also reflect dramatic changes in cell mechanics and cytoskeletal arrangements. The reported method is useful to manipulate cell shape and mechanics in a facile and cost-effective manner and most importantly enables investigate mechanotransduction events dynamically. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - For a seismically designed concentrically braced frame with hollow structural sections as braces, the typical connection design consists of a slotted brace that is field welded to a gusset plate. During an earthquake, the brace is expected to buckle out-of-plane and the gusset plate is expected to yield. This makes it difficult to repair or replace the brace and connection, and the out-of-plane brace buckling caused by this connection can also damage surrounding walls and cladding, with potential life safety implications. This paper proposes an alternative connection that is expected to result in reduced erection costs by avoiding site welding, and also to simplify structural repairs following a major earthquake by confining all damage to a replaceable brace module. Additionally, the new connection causes the brace to buckle in-plane during a seismic event, reducing the potential for damage to the surrounding walls and cladding. This paper discusses large-scale quasi-static cyclic testing of eight brace modules with two variations of the new connection, one with a single-shear eccentric splice and the other with a double-sided concentric splice. All tested specimens had the desired failure progression and buckled in-plane, as intended. Bolt slip in the connection had very little effect on the overall force-deflection response after the brace compressive strength degraded to less than the slip load. The brace module was replaced after each test without observable damage outside the module. Although both connection variations behaved in a desirable manner, the single-shear eccentric splice was preferred because of the simpler constructability and improved performance. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  -                              Descriptions of the interactions between volcano plumbing systems and early-stage rift systems dominated by large half grabens and tilted fault blocks are scarce and lack detail. 3-D seismic reflection data across the Early Miocene-age subduction-related Kora Volcano plumbing system in the Taranaki Basin, offshore New Zealand, provides an opportunity to investigate in detail how this system has interacted with a Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene rift system. The shallow (< 8-km-depth) architecture of intrusions are dominated by stacked saucer-shaped, and transgressive sills, and laccolith complexes distributed in an oval shape around the volcano. The thickest sill complexes occur in the thickest (fault-controlled) syn-rift depocenters. There is also local elongation of sill complexes in a N-S direction following structural trends. Numerous sills locally follow segments of large normal faults, or terminate at the faults. Laterally extensive sill complexes tend to lie close to the base of the syn-rift/top of pre-rift contact for distances up to 15 km away from the Kora Volcano. A general pattern is that the lowest-level sills are the most laterally extensive, and the shallower sills lie closer to the volcano. Shallow sills form a complex of concentric sills that dip away from the volcano center (ring sills). Sills are interpreted to have been fed by intrusions following faults that intersect a broad upper crustal magma chamber with a calculated area of ~345 km                             2                             . Strong preference for sill/laccolith stacking in the thick syn-rift section appears to have had four effects. (1) In the upper 6 km there probably was not a simple single pipe feeding the volcano, instead the volcano is inferred to have been fed by a network of sills linked by short dikes and pipes. (2) The extensive intrusions resulted in folding/doming of the Paleogene section in several places, but most significantly under the central part of the volcano. (3) Much of the magma was stored in intrusive complexes within the syn-rift section and the underlying magma chamber (volume ~124 km                             3                             ), not extruded (volume ~40 km                             3                             ). (4) Edifice construction and broad doming related to subsurface intrusions may have caused the crest of the volcano to become subaerial. The consequent absence of phreatomagmatic eruptions and the extensive accumulation of magma in relatively thin sill complexes (that could cool relatively rapidly and solidify) avoided a destructive end to the volcanic edifice.                          © 2018 The Authors.

Twenty-eight male adolescent volleyball players (15.5 ± 1.1 years (15–17 years); 73.2 ± 10.9 kg (55.3–100.1 kg) and 184.9 ± 8.4 cm (170–209 cm)) participated in this cross-sectional study. Concentric and eccentric peak torque of external and internal rotator muscles were measured, and conventional and functional strength balance ratios were calculated. The dominant limb presented significantly higher values for peak torque than the non-dominant limb of internal rotator muscles at concentric action assessed at 60◦/s (48.7 ± 13.7 Nm and 43.9 ± 11.6 Nm, p = 0.01 and d value = 0.37) and at 240◦/s (44.7 ± 11.2 Nm and 41.1 ± 11.0 Nm, p = 0.03 and d = 0.32). However, there was no difference in the peak torque of external rotator muscle between limbs for either angular speed. Regarding strength balance ratios, neither conventional (74.8 ± 14.3 for dominant limb and 80.1 ± 14.0 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.37) nor functional ratio (1.2 ± 0.4 for dominant limb and 1.3 ± 0.5 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.22) presented significant contralateral differences. Despite the short practice time, adolescent male volleyball athletes already have significant contralateral differences for internal rotator muscles and conventional ratio tends to be asymmetrical. Thus, preventive shoulder-strengthening programs, focused on the internal rotator muscles of the non-dominant limb, aiming to correct contralateral deficiency and conventional ratio, may be warranted for this population in the process of biological growth, maturation and development. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Haines, MR. Differences in glenohumeral joint rotation and peak power output between Super League and Championship Rugby League players. J Strength Cond Res 32(6): 1685-1691, 2018-Rugby league is a high-intensity sport with large impact forces sustained during play, resulting in high prevalence of shoulder injury. Consequently, shoulder strength and player power are important considerations for injury prevention and performance. Additionally, professional teams regularly compete against semiprofessional teams, where differences in physical conditioning could be marked. The aim of this study was to test for differences in glenohumeral joint rotation and peak power between a professional Super League (SL) and semiprofessional Rugby League Championship (RLC) teams. A cross-sectional analysis was used to test 25 SL and 24 RLC players during preseason training. Isokinetic dynamometry, at 2408$s21 for concentric and eccentric actions was used to assess glenohumeral rotation. Peak power was determined using a maximal 30-second cycle ergometer test. Selective muscular development of the internal rotators without concomitant external rotator strength was evident in the SL team but not the RLC team. Internal rotation peak torque was higher for the SL club for concentric (;24%) and eccentric (;16%) muscle actions (p # 0.05), and this contributed to a lower ipsilateral reciprocal muscle group ratio (external to internal concentric) for the SL team compared with the RLC team (;47% and;60% respectively; p # 0.05). Peak power output was also higher for the SL team (1,409 6 153 vs. 1,273 6 159 W; p # 0.05). The results highlight a mismatch in the physical conditioning of SL and RLC players with implications for practitioners to design strength and conditioning programs that minimize the risk of injury while optimizing performance. © 2017 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - Saudi Arabian foreign policy is built on a foundation of preserving the state and turning the Greater Middle East region into a defensive buffer zone. It looks at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and peninsular nations as merely the first circle of concentric foreign policy zones that need to be managed differently with the chief goal constantly in mind. This posture is key in preventing Western, anti-Islamic, or different Islamic forces from reaching its territory whether these are in the form of sectarian, ideological, or social movements that threaten to undo traditional Saudi values and standards of Islamic practice. This defensive foreign policy means that Saudi Arabia is not only continually engaged in foreign affairs and is highly active in world diplomacy but that it is also more aggressive and less tolerant of rebuff. Most foreign policy analysis of Saudi Arabia centers on the issues of oil and Iran; however, with this perspective it is easier to see that it is more likely that these are aspects or tools of their foreign policy rather than the sum total of their objective. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - At the southern limit of its range the endangered butterfl y Coenonympha oedippus inhabits grasslands (wet, dry) that differ signifi cantly in the abundance of its larval hostplants (wet > dry) and mean annual air temperature (wet < dry). We determined the difference in the wing morphology of individuals in the two contrasting habitats to test whether and how traits associated with wing size, shape and eye like spots vary in the sexes and two ecotypes. We show that sexual dimorphism follows the same (wing size and shape, number of eyespots on forewing) or different (relative area of eyespots on hindwings) patterns in the two contrasting habitats. Irrespective of ecotype, females had larger, longer and narrower wings, and more forewing eyespots than males. Sexual dimorphism in the relative area of eyespots on hindwing was female-biased in the wet, but male-biased in the dry ecotype. Ecotype dimorphism in wing size and the relative area of eyespots on the hindwing is best explained by mean annual air temperature and abundance of host-plants. While ecotype dimorphism in wing size did not differ between sexes, neither in direction (wet > dry) or in degree, in the two sexes the relative area of eyespots on hindwing had opposite patterns (males: dry > wet; females: wet > dry) and was more pronounced in males than in females. The differences in wing shape between ecotypes were detected only in the hindwings of males, with more rounded apex in the dry than in the wet ecotype. We discuss the life-history traits, behavioural strategies and selection mechanisms, which largely account for the sex- and ecotype-specifi c variation in wing morphology. © Institute of Entomology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceské Budèjovice.

AB  - Distance relaying has conventionally used blinder or concentric characteristic based differentiation between normal faults and power swing, which is necessary to avoid relay mal-operation during the swing. Such schemes involve blinder position and timer settings which depend on the line and system impedances, and swing frequency. Therefore, they do need careful adaptations if there are significant changes in these parameters. Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable sources of power, the grid inertia is bound to reduce. This leads to increase in swing frequencies, which makes timer based differentiation between swing and fault problematic. To alleviate these problems, many non-conventional techniques have been reported in the recent literature. Unblocking of the relay after a fault during the block period is another important aspect which has received significant research attention. The aim of this paper is to review these methods of relaying under swing conditions. A classification of the methods and a comparison among them with respect to factors like system parameter dependence, time for detection, measurements required, and computational burden are presented. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Steel Multi-Tiered Concentrically Braced Frames (MT-CBFs) are commonly used in North America as a lateral load-resisting system of tall single-story buildings. Multi-Tiered configurations are typically used when a single braced panel between the roof and ground levels is impractical in the case of tall building. Past studies show that MT-CBF columns designed in accordance with the 2010 US Seismic Provisions are prone to buckling due to a high axial compression force and in-plane bending demands induced in columns as a result of non-uniform distribution of brace inelastic deformations along the frame height. Special design provisions have been introduced in the current US Seismic Provisions to address flexural demands imposed on MT-CBF columns and prevent column instability. Nevertheless, the recent improvements lack full-scale experimental testing and comprehensive finite element simulations featuring current guidelines. In this study, the seismic design methods for Multi-Tiered Special Concentrically Braced Frames are evaluated using the nonlinear finite element method. First, a two-tiered SCBF was designed in accordance with the 2010 and 2016 requirements. A detailed finite element model of the frames was then created and a non-linear cyclic-pushover analysis was performed to evaluate the seismic performance of both frames. Special attention was paid to the validation of the design forces prescribed in the 2016 Seismic Provisions. Analyses results confirmed that the inelastic deformations in the frame designed using the 2010 requirements are not uniformly distributed but rather concentrated in one of the tiers; whereas, the current design method significantly reduces the concentration of inelastic deformations in a single tier and prevents column instability. Furthermore, it was found that column in-plane flexural demands are overestimated when designed in accordance with the current provisions. Further numerical simulations on a large number of frame configurations using the dynamic response history analysis procedure are required to verify this observation.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to examine the significance and limitation of a V-clip developed to prevent the opening of overlapped channel-type hoops in the jacket section of section enlargement strengthening columns. Five full-scale columns were tested under concentric axial loads. Test results revealed that, until ultimate failure of strengthed columns, no opening of the overlapped legs of the channel-type hoops and supplementary V-ties was observed in the jacket section with the developed V-ties and V-clips. The axial ductility ratios of the strengthened columns with V-ties and V-clips were as much as 1.66 times higher when compared with that measured in the existing non-seismic column. In addition, the strengthened columns with V-ties and V-clips exhibited 1.42 times higher axial ductility than those of counterpart columns without V-clips of the same details. Overall, the proposed supplementary V-ties and V-clips possess the potential to enhance the ductility of section enlargement strengthening columns, satisfying the seismic design details of code provision in the jacket section. © 2019 by Korea Concrete Institute.

AB  - The Cerattepe mine, one of the volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits in northeastern Turkey, is hosted within the late Cretaceous volcanic, intrusive and sedimentary rocks. Deposit’s main ore body contains high-grade massive copper sulfides and a gold-silver and barium rich oxide zone, characterized by dense alteration stages, is situated on top of it. Replacement, cataclastic, breccia, dissemination, dendritic, concentric growth, colloform, and framboidal textures were identified. Pyrite, sphalerite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, bornite, galena, tennantite-tetrahedrite, gold, covellite, digenite, chalcocite, cuprite and cubanite constitute the mineral paragenesis where quartz, calcite and barite account for the gangue minerals. Limonite, hematite, lepidocrocite, malachite, azurite and jarosite developed in the oxidation zone. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Heroyiv Oborony Str., 15, Kyiv, 03041, Ukraine The article is timed to the investigation of a disk type pneumatic apparatus with centralized seed sowing. The design feature of this apparatus is that the seed cells are placed concentrically on the bottom of the disc, which has a tilted axis of rotation. As a result, the value of the force of suction of the seed to the cell at the extreme points lying on the horizontal diameter of the disk during its movement from the upper position to the bottom and vice versa, has different meanings. The article presents a fragment of a disk with a cell and placed in it by a seed at the moment of its movement from the upper position to the lower one.In this case, the center of the cell and the seed coincide and lie on a straight line which extends along the bottom surface of the disk. Through the joint center of the seed and the cell, the XYZ coordinate system was performed and the direction of the forces was shown. The analysis of the forces acting on the seed indicates that during the rotation of the seed element the load on the rear pushing wall of the cell increases dramatically, and the seed is pressed against the wall of the cell, while the front end of the seed may be unloaded. As a result, there is not a stable position and it can escape from the closet. To prevent this, the seed is kept in the cells due to the suction force. In order to determine the value of the force of suction of the seed to the cell, moving from the upper position to the bottom, in the article the scheme of forces acting on the seed at that moment is considered and the condition of equilibrium of these forces is drawn up. On the basis of this condition, an analytical dependence of the seed suction force on a seed cell with a tilted axis of rotation is obtained, as from the structural and technological parameters (γ, α, R, ω, h) of the seed element, and the physical and mechanical properties (m, r, l, f, ϵ, ρ) of the seed itself. The obtained dependence makes it possible to determine the values of the force of suction of seeds to the cells intended for servicing the left-hand group of seeders of the seeders. © Scientific Horizons 2018.

AB  - Purpose: Traffic accidents are associated with the visual function of drivers, as well as many other factors. Driving simulator systems have the advantage of controlling for traffic- and automobile-related conditions, and using pinhole glasses can control the degree of concentric concentration of the visual field. We evaluated the effect of concentric constriction of the visual field on automobile driving, using driving simulator tests. Methods: Subjects meeting criteria for normal eyesight were included in the study. Pinhole glasses with variable aperture sizes were adjusted to mimic the conditions of concentric visual field constrictions of 10° and 15°, using a CLOCK CHART®. The test contained 8 scenarios (2 oncoming right-turning cars and 6 jump-out events from the side). Results: Eighty-eight subjects were included in the study; 37(mean age = 52.9±15.8 years) subjects were assigned to the 15° group, and 51 (mean = 48.6±15.5 years) were assigned to the 10° group. For all 8 scenarios, the number of accidents was significantly higher among pinhole wearing subjects. The average number of all types of accidents per person was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group (4.59±1.81) than the pinhole 15° group (3.68±1.49) (P = 0.032). The number of accidents associated with jump-out scenarios, in which a vehicle approaches from the side on a straight road with a good view, was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group than in the pinhole 15° group. Conclusions: Concentric constriction of the visual field was associated with increased number of traffic accidents. The simulation findings indicated that a visual field of 10° to 15° may be important for avoiding collisions in places where there is a straight road with a good view. © 2018 Udagawa et al.

AB  - Invaded, displaced, and dispossessed, the aboriginal Khoisan populations of South Africa were enslaved and pushed to the margins of society well before the arrival of European settlers in the seventeenth century; actually, the Bantu groups which had invaded southern Africa in the previous centuries had colonised various regions, due to their physical and military superiority. In contemporary South Africa, the condition of these people is still precarious, judging from the various forms of political protest reclaiming full citizenship for Khoisan communities. In some cases, however, the rereading of History on the part of minority groups to obtain social and political recognition tends to reproduce, and therefore to confirm, the stereotypes and simplifications that contributed to their marginalisation in the first place. The case of the Khoikhoi populations in South Africa - classified as 'coloured', but still claiming specific ethnic identities of their own - is read here through the lens of literature, and specifically through the novel David's Story by Zoë Wicomb - a South African writer who has always avoided the trap of simplism both as narrator and as social and literary critic. © 2019 Universita degli Studi di Milano.

AB  - In mining operations carried out below the water table, mine area could potentially affect the surrounding. With further deepening of the mine and quarry, the drawdown can impact on water supply wells and base flow. The variation in radius of influence under confined and unconfined aquifer condition is assessed using a hypothetical case study with three operational quarry sites. Average pit-wise radius of influence (R0) for the pit mine, under unconfined and confined aquifer conditions is 963 m and 61 km, respectively, whereas effective radius (Re) for total (cumulative) excavated mine area is 1.7 and 146 km, respectively. It means that the maximum and minimum value of overall impact/influence for the unconfined aquifer lies in-between 963 m and 1.7 km. Similarly that the maximum and minimum value of overall impact/influence for the confined aquifer lies in-between 61 and 146 km. Meanwhile, Re or effective radius for total (cumulative) excavated area seems more appropriate from evaluation viewpoint due to the overlapping (superposition) concentric mining quarries. Thus, assessment of quarry-wise and total radius of influence is of importance to fulfil targeted production, economically with minimum interruptions as part of the mine planning. Moreover, it helps us to assess, monitor and regulate the impact of a mine-dewatering program in the area. Also, the pumping test is often used to estimate radius of influence; it can trigger the inflow or radius of influence. Estimate of the radius of influence using analytical equation mainly independent of discharge/abstraction from the aquifer stands as a preferred choice for the prediction of radius of influence at the quarry/mine pit. There is a strong rationale that policies should be informed by such analytical assessment because it helps us to prevent or minimize negative impacts as part of regulation and pit-mining management and are useful tools for practitioners to design economically efficient and cost-effective in situ groundwater remediation systems, to contain contaminant plumes, to evaluate the surface–subsurface water interaction and to verify numerical models. © 2017, © 2017 IAHR and WCCE.

AB  - The Olympic Dam Cu-U-Au-Ag deposit is dominantly composed of mineralised hematite-breccias and occurs entirely within the Roxby Downs Granite. Multivariate statistical analysis of a large whole-rock, 15 m-interval geochemical dataset (10,565 samples) was undertaken to identify geochemical signatures characteristic of iron-oxide copper gold (IOCG)-style mineralization and constrain the conspicuous lithogeochemical zonation observed at Olympic Dam. Statistical analyses include principal component analysis on centred logratio (clr)-transformed data coupled with hierarchical clustering. Certain groups of elements that can be interpreted in terms of an evolving hydrothermal system relative to host lithologies are derived from data analysis: granitophile (U-W-Sn-Mo); siderophile (Ni-Co); chalcophile (Ag-Bi) and related elements (As-Sb and Au-Te). The distributions of elements within each group are investigated through three vertical cross-sections and are compared with known lithological and Cu-(Fe)-sulphide zonation. Throughout the Olympic Dam Breccia Complex, the IOCG signature is defined by multi-element combinations of the commodity metals Cu, U, Au, and Ag, coupled with a range of trace elements. Overall, the IOCG signature overlaps well with Fe-metasomatism despite mismatch which is likely due to discrete styles of mineralisation found only on the margins of the deposit and also to the presence of mineralised domains within Fe-poor zones. The IOCG signature is composed of two geochemical associations, which exhibit distinct spatial distributions. The first group, Cu-U3O8-Se-S, shows concentric zonation whereas the second group, Au-W-Mo-Sb-As, forms a vertical ∼1800 m deep corridor in the southeastern lobe of the deposit. The specific Au-W-Mo-As-Sb signature could potentially be generic within IOCG systems across the Olympic Cu-Au province and if so, would provide a proxy model for near-mine exploration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We study periodically driven Taylor-Couette turbulence, i.e. the flow confined between two concentric, independently rotating cylinders. Here, the inner cylinder is driven sinusoidally while the outer cylinder is kept at rest (time-averaged Reynolds number is Rei = 5 × 105). Using particle image velocimetry, we measure the velocity over a wide range of modulation periods, corresponding to a change in Womersley number in the range 15 ≤ Wo ≤ 114. To understand how the flow responds to a given modulation, we calculate the phase delay and amplitude response of the azimuthal velocity. In agreement with earlier theoretical and numerical work, we find that for large modulation periods the system follows the given modulation of the driving, i.e. the behaviour of the system is quasi-stationary. For smaller modulation periods, the flow cannot follow the modulation, and the flow velocity responds with a phase delay and a smaller amplitude response to the given modulation. If we compare our results with numerical and theoretical results for the laminar case, we find that the scalings of the phase delay and the amplitude response are similar. However, the local response in the bulk of the flow is independent of the distance to the modulated boundary. Apparently, the turbulent mixing is strong enough to prevent the flow from having radius-dependent responses to the given modulation. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - A quasi-dimensional thermodynamic model was developed using concept of the fractal-geometry combustion model by focusing on the behavior of the natural gas flame near the combustion chamber walls in SI engines. A new wall-flame interaction sub-model was designed and implemented in the thermodynamic model by considering the flame geometry and temperature of the combustion chamber walls. Near the walls, the dimensionless factor affects the fractal combustion model which reduces the heat release rate (HRR). First, the combustion process of natural gas fueled SI engine was simulated using a CFD software and the flame geometry was extracted for each crank angle. The results were validated with experimental data at various engine operating conditions so that the results were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The results show that the concentric spherical flame propagation assumption is not true for the off-center spark plug. The walls near the flame prevent its propagation and its shape deviates from the spherical form. The points of flame collisions on the walls are one of the determinant factors in the heat release process. The flame quenching and HRR vary at different walls of the combustion chamber and both of them are proportional to the wall temperature and flame area affected by the walls. Finally, it can be concluded that, natural gas turbulent flame propagation is occurred in three stages: 1- The initial propagation of flame with high acceleration, in which 15% of the fuel is burned with a high HRR. 2- Collision of the flame with the floor of the piston, HRR continues with almost constant rate, in which 30% and 50% of the fuel is burned for the off-centered and centered spark plug locations, respectively. 3- Deceleration of the flame propagation after colliding with the side walls, in which 55% and 35% of the fuel is burned for the off-centered and centered spark plug locations, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cities are suffering various ecological risks due to rapid urbanization and global climate change. Urban landscape ecological risk assessment is conducive to identifying high risk areas and guiding risk prevention. However, few studies have characterized the dynamic processes of landscape ecological risk. In this study, taking Beijing City as a case study, the adaptive cycle in resilience theory was incorporated into a risk assessment framework using such three criteria as potential, connectedness, and resilience, together with integrating exposure and disturbance effects of risk sources. This framework contributed to understanding the complex interactions between landscapes and risk effects from a holistic and dynamic view. The results showed that the ecological risk of “potential” and “connectedness” weakened radially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The distributions of “resilience”, “exposure”, “disturbance”, and the final risk, all exhibited a concentric pattern of the higher risk, highest risk, and lowest risk sequentially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The results reflected the facts that residents living in downtowns had taken ecological restoration measures to reduce risk, while continuous urban constructions in outer suburbs increased the risk. In terms of the adaptive cycle phases of ecological risk, Yanqing, Miyun, Huairou, Mentougou, Fangshan and Pinggu districts were in the reorganization α-phase; Daxing, Changping, Shunyi and Tongzhou districts were in the exploitation r-phase; Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Haidian, Chaoyang and Shijingshan districts were in the conservation K-phase. The results provided scientifically spatial guidance for implementing resilient urban planning, in order to realize sustainable development of metropolitan areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Analytical representations of the flows associated with doubly periodic arrangements of point singularities of two-dimensional Stokes flow are derived. The analysis makes use of a conformal mapping from a concentric annulus to a rectangle. A natural mathematical object known as the Schottky–Klein prime function is used to derive the solutions avoiding the theory of elliptic functions. The new expressions have the advantage of being immediately amenable to fast evaluation without the need for Ewald or other fast summation methods or acceleration techniques for lattice sums. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices have adverse impacts on the performance of distance relays (DRs) due to the fast intervention of the controllers of these devices during power swing. Power swing blocker (PSB) as the complementary part in a DR is designed to distinguish a fault from a power swing; meanwhile its performance in compensated lines needs to be investigated. The performance of concentric PSB (CPSB) is studied in transmission lines compensated by unified power flow controller (UPFC). It is shown that fast responses of proportional-integral (PI) controllers of UPFC, reduce recorded time by CPSB significantly (it decreases by 90% of uncompensated condition) which makes DR to issue trip command during power swing condition. Detailed model of UPFC is simulated in three-machine and New England power systems to show the deficiency of CPSB in compensated condition. In order to overcome the deficiency of the CPSB in UPFC-compensated line, two remedial actions are proposed. The first method is based on modifying CPSB to solve the problem and the second method is based on modifying control loop of UPFC to prevent the problem. Both methods show their efficiency to overcome the deficiency. © 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - This paper presents simulations of stationary and transient (fault condition) regimes for a three-phase concentric HTS cable with and without a standalone superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). The stationary study carried out previously to the transient analysis verifies the viability of the proposed cable design. The response of the HTS cable to fault currents by varying the thickness of copper stabilization layers is analyzed. As an option, an SFCL is supposed to be connected in series to the same HTS cable to investigate if and how an SFCL device could protect the HTS cable as well as the power network. Results show that fault currents can be limited by adapting the copper layer thickness of the HTS tapes in the cable, but this may result in too high temperatures in the coolant. Only a carefully designed SFCL device can prevent longer cable outages or even damages in the HTS cable caused by too high temperatures. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to characterize in young chicks the myopia control effects of part-time wear of two-zone concentric bifocal lenses. Nine-day-old chicks (n = 115) were first made myopic with monocular −10 Diopter (D) single vision (SV) lenses worn for 3 days. Over the 6 days following myopia induction, either 1) two-zone bifocal lenses (−10 D center/−5 D periphery, BFDC) were worn for 12 (full-time), 10, 8, or 6 h, with −10 D SV lenses worn for the remainder of the day, or 2) BFDC or BFNC (−5 D center/−10 D periphery) lenses were worn every other day (EOD). Control birds wore −10 D SV lenses every day. Refractive error (RE) and axial ocular dimensions were monitored every three days with retinoscopy and high frequency A-scan ultrasonography respectively. Mean interocular RE and axial length differences after 3 days of myopia induction (±SEM) were −9.6 ± 0.19 D and 0.26 ± 0.01 mm across the groups. At the end of the following 6-day treatment period, equivalent values were: −10.66 ± 0.28 D, 0.42 ± 0.02 mm (SV-control); 1) −4.61 ± 0.29 D, 0.26 ± 0.02 mm (BFDC, 12 h); −4.82 ± 0.23 D, 0.28 ± 0.02 mm (BFDC, 10 h); −5.21 ± 0.27 D, 0.24 ± 0.02 mm (BFDC, 8 h); −6.34 ± 0.34 D, 0.25 ± 0.03 mm (BFDC, 6 h); 2) −8.29 ± 0.29 D, 0.32 ± 0.03 mm (BFDC, EOD), and −8.83 ± 0.36 D, 0.33 ± 0.03 mm (BFNC, EOD). Overall, full-time BFDC and part-time BFDC and BFNC lens groups exhibited similar changes and were less myopic than the SV group. The results suggest that bifocal lenses may have myopia control effects even when worn part-time, interleaved with standard (SV) myopic corrections, especially if worn for at least 6 h per day. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Squeak and rattle concerns account for approximately 10% of overall vehicle Things Gone Wrong (TGW) and are a major quality concern for automotive OEM's. Seat is one of the major contributors of squeak and rattle issues observed in customer verbatim. Seat head rest rod and bezel are designed concentric to each other with a gap that allows free movement and a locking pin to position at different levels. Due to the design gap and weight of the head rest there is always tendency for relative displacement leading to rattle issues. Seat headrest, is close to the customer ear and any rattles at headrest will create annoying driving experience. Also, the contradictory requirements between efforts and rattle makes the scenario more difficult to fine tune the bezel specifications. The root cause for head rest rattle issues can also be related to free play between bezel and seat frame, free play between bezel and cap, looseness between locking pin and headrest rod etc. Identification of issue at physical testing is common practice subject to availability of test sample and road load data. Also, source identification and modification comes at the later part of the project. This paper establishes a process to perform the head rest rattle analysis by utilizing existing FE techniques. The FE analysis is performed using SNRD software available in hyper works platform. An older program seat FE model is built and validated with experimental results. Also, relative displacement measured between the headrest rod and bezel are correlated well with the simulation results. The occurrence and severity of rattle can be understood when the relative displacement is more than the design gap. Also, root cause analysis is performed by modal contribution analysis which gives an option for design sensitivity studies and compare relative displacements of different designs. The proposed methodology using FE techniques can help in identifying head rest rattle issues at early design stage. © 2019 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The diversity and sustainability of species composition are important topic of forest research. The possibility to observe the coexistence of tree species in a given forest patch and their succession in the next generation is limited because there are few forests unaffected by management activities. For this reason, the study was conducted in the oldest part of the Białowieża National Park, called Strict Reserve. The purpose of the research was to determine the relationship between the quantity of individual tree species in the overstorey (the standing volume of trees with the diameter at breast height d≥8 cm) and regeneration layer (the total height of trees with the diameter at breast height d<8 cm or height h≤1.3 m) as well as the relationships between those stand layers. Multiple regression and canonical analysis were used to determine the relationships between 12 tree species (tab. 1). The research material was the results of measurements of 920 concentric sample plots conducted in 1995 and 2005. In the overstorey, the correlation coefficient between the standing volume of a given tree species on sample plots and the standing volume of other tree species assumed for each species both significant positive values (species 'co-occurrence'), significant negative values (species 'avoidance') and close to zero values (fig. 1). The same was true for the regeneration layer (fig. 2). In eight cases the correlation between the total height of trees of a given species in the regeneration layer and the standing volume of trees from the overstorey showed the highest positive values when referred to the 'regeneration-overstorey' relationship of the same species (fig. 3). The same referred to the 'overstorey-regeneration' relationship (fig. 4). Eight of the canonical variables turned out to be significant (tab. 2). For the first canonical variable, standing volume of hornbeam in the overstorey (Gb-m) showed the highest absolute value of the loading factor in the first dataset, while the variable the total height of hornbeam trees in the regeneration layer (Gb-o) - in the other dataset (fig. 5). The total redundancy was 20.7%, which means that such part of the variance of the total height of individual tree species in the regeneration layer could be explained by their standing volume in the overstorey. The sequence of tree generations understood as the relationship between species composition of the regeneration and overstorey layers was associated with life strategies of tree species. © 2018 Polish Forest Society.

AB  - Recently, the combination of a press-fit acetabular cup and ceramic articulation has been widely used for implanting cementless acetabular components and has been shown to provide good initial stability. However, this combination may lead to the failure of ceramic liners by their non-concentric seating due to acetabular cup deformation. To reduce the risk of this, we applied direct metal tooling (DMT)-based additive manufacturing (AM) with the hypothesis that DMT-based AM would minimize the deformation of the acetabular cup by increasing its strength, which would ultimately prevent the ceramic liner from fracturing. To confirm this, we performed post-fatigue tests simulating a press-fit situation for the acetabular cups subjected to DMT-based AM and compared them with the cups treated with titanium plasma spray (TPS). The post-fatigue tests were then performed under a maximum load of 14 kN for 20 × 107 cycles. The roundness and inner diameter of the cups and liners were measured in all testing phases. The results revealed no differences between the acetabular cups subjected to DMT-based AM and TPS. However, when comparing only the mean values directly, the results for the acetabular cup subjected to DMT-based AM indicated that it might have increased the strength of the acetabular cup, compared with those treated with TPS, thereby minimizing the possibility of fracture of the ceramic liner. In conclusion, DMT-based AM was shown to be at least equivalent to TPS, or could possibly supersede it. Additionally, via DMT-based AM, it is possible to control the porous structure freely, so this approach allows a greater range of applications and potential for further improvement than TPS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The authors participated in the design of the silo model test facility, which can be used to measure the storage force of the grain heap, such as the bottom pressure, the side wall pressure and the friction force of the bulk grain heap. The self-designed silo model was 480 mm in diameter and 2 102 mm high. The silo wall, constructed of organic glass, was composed of 3 separate parts. There is a 1-mm thick gap between each part of the walls to prevent the outflow of grain. The 3 parts of the wall were named Top Wall (l 000 mm high, fixed on the steel frame), Middle Wall (100 mm high) and Upper Wall (1 000 mm high). The silo bottom, which can be raised and lowered, was divided into 4 parts (1 concentric circle and 3 concentric rings). The Top Wall, the Middle Wall and each parts of silo bottom were supported on three force sensors to measure the wall friction as well as the vertical pressure on the floor. Three earth pressure cells were embedded in the middle line of the Middle Wall to measure the wall lateral pressure. Two experimental schemes were carried out. No.1 scheme is that: Fill the silo model with wheat to a height of 100 mm at each time until the height of the wheat reached 1 000 mm. Record the data obtained from each of the force sensors supported under each part of the silo bottom as well as the force sensors supported under the Upper Wall of each grain height. This scheme is designed to measure the radial distribution of bottom pressure under different grain heights. The No.2 scheme is that: Fill the silo model with wheat to a height of 1 000 mm and then raise the flat bottom to the lower edge of the Middle Wall. Drop the bottom by 50 mm at each time. Meanwhile, record the data obtained from the earth pressure cells embedded in the Middle Wall and the data obtained from the force sensors supported under the Middle Wall at difficult depths of wheat. The distribution of the storage force at the boundary was measured in the experiment. The rationality of the model test data is verified by compared with the classic theory. Combined with the experimental data, it is found that the bottom pressure of silo grain heap presents the uneven distribution characteristics of "large in middle and small on sides", and the uneven distribution degree is gradually obvious with the increase of grain loading height. The lateral pressure of silo wall is slightly larger than that of Janssen formula when the depth is more than 0.5 m. The friction of the side wall is larger than that of Janssen formula along the whole depth of wheat. And the value of the friction coefficient between the grain and the silo wall is smaller than external friction coefficient measured by directly sheared tests along the whole depth of wheat. It proved that the value of wall friction calculated by Janssen formula is larger than what it really is and the state between the wheat and silo wall haven't reach the limit equilibrium. The lateral pressure coefficient measured by experiment is closed to Rankine's main dynamic and is less than active earth pressure coefficient. The experiment results show that the model silo test device has good repeatability, and it can provide a simple and feasible technical support for the theory of storage pressure. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare mechanical muscle function in the eccentric/concentric phases of vertical bilateral jumping in anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed (ACLR), elite (ELITE), and adolescent (ADOL) alpine ski racers and ski cross athletes. Methods: Alpine ski racers/ski crossers (ACLR: n = 12, age = 26.7 ± 3.8 years; ELITE: n = 12, age = 23.9 ± 3.0 years; ADOL: n = 12, age = 17.8 ± 0.7 years; females: n = 6 per group, males: n = 6 per group) performed 5 maximal countermovement jumps (CMJs) and 5 squat jumps. The ground reaction forces for each limb were analyzed using dual force plate recording to obtain body center of mass (BCM) velocity, displacement, and power. The eccentric deceleration (ECC) and concentric phases were determined from BCM velocity. CMJ net concentric and ECC impulses were calculated (body mass normalized) along with the peak and mean BCM power and maximal vertical jump height. CMJ lower limb stiffness (LLS) was determined by the slope of the ground reaction forces vs. the BCM displacement curve over the ECC phase. Concentric and ECC asymmetry indices were calculated for each leg, and the left vs. right LLS was compared. Outcome measures (reported as mean ± SD) calculated as a 5-jump mean were normalized to body mass and compared using an analysis of variance. Results: No between-group differences were found for peak and mean power or jump heights. There were no group differences for LLS or net concentric phase impulse, but the net ECC impulse was lower in the ADOL group compared with ELITE skiers (ADOL: 1.33 ± 0.32 Ns/kg; ELITE: 1.59 ± 0.16 Ns/kg; p < 0.05). Although no group differences were found for ECC asymmetry indices, a group × limb interaction was found for LLS (p < 0.01), which was systematically higher in the right vs. the left limb of ADOL skiers (right: 54.1 ± 17.9 N/m/kg; left: 48.7 ± 15.7 N/m/kg; p < 0.01). Conclusion: ADOL skiers demonstrated decreased ECC impulse and systematic right limb dominance in LLS compared with ACLR and ELITE skiers. The implication of these findings for injury and performance are unknown, but further investigation into these potential relationships is warranted. © 2018

AB  - Thermal cloaks can thermally hide an object without disturbing background thermal field. The coordinate transformation method for designing conventional thermal cloaks face some challenges that the physical properties of metamaterials are required to be anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Furthermore, the coordinate transformation is not applicable for complex geometrical conditions. In this study, a proactive thermal cloak is proposed. The cloak contains two concentric annular zones: one with high thermal conductivity and another with adaptive heat source. The cloaked zone is surrounded by the high thermal conductivity zone. The high thermal conductivity zone keeps the object in the cloaked zone from thermally being affected by outside zones. The heat source zone adjusts the background thermal field without any distortion. The thermal cloak with an analytical heat source distribution is presented for the 2D and 3D background thermal fields with uniform gradient. The adaptive heat source in the thermal cloak is designed by inverse problem theory of a numerical method for the 2D arbitrary background thermal field. This proactive thermal cloak can avoid the issue of anisotropic physical properties for the conventional thermal cloak designed with coordinate transformation method. The heat source thermal cloak with relatively easy implementation can manipulate temperature field proactively without contact. This thermal cloak is applicable for arbitrary background thermal fields and complex geometrical conditions by a numerical design approach. The proposed thermal cloak opens a new strategy to manipulate the thermal field with adaptive heat source. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A basic knowledge of how maps are planned and how they may be intended, that is, the politics of mapping, enables a map reader to gain the faculty of graphic literacy, and thereby an awareness of the power of maps. Maps are not only formal projections that net the world mathematically. The North-on-top convention, for world maps especially, probably originated with the Greek scientist-geographer Claudius Ptolemy. World maps with North at the top were easier to study. The most obviously “dynamic” of map symbols are the oriented, or directional, ones such as the concentric circles and arrows drawn on the German maps to indicate the pressures of Einkreisung constraint and the counterforces of a Durchbruch strategy. Not only Harrison’s standard-projection maps but also his wonderful bird’s-eye-view, or perspective, maps of the various theaters of Second World War demonstrated brilliantly the virtues of cartographic agility. © 1994, 1999 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - The complex nature of air pollution in urban areas prevents traditional monitoring techniques from obtaining measurements representative of true human exposure. The current study assessed the capability of low-cost mobile monitors to acquire useful data in a city without a monitoring network in place (Lubbock, Texas) using a bicycle platform. The monitoring campaign resulted in 30 days of data along a 13.4 km fixed concentric route. Due to high sensitivities to airflow, the apparent wind velocity was accounted for throughout the route. The data were also normalized into percentiles in order to visualize spatial patterns. The highest estimated pollution levels were located near frequently busy intersections and roads; however, sensor issues resulted in lower confidence. Additional research is needed concerning the appropriate use of low-cost metal oxide sensors for citizen science applications, as measurements can be misleading if the user is unaware of sensors specifications. The simultaneous use of several low-cost mobile platforms, rather than a single platform, as well as the use of high-end cases, are recommended to create a more robust spatial analysis. The issues addressed from this research are important to understand for accurate and beneficial application of low-cost gaseous monitors for citizen science. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Swimming motor patterns lead internal rotators to grow stronger than antagonist muscles, what may increase the risk of injury in swimmers. Injury prevention often involves the improvement of external rotators strength, as well as the external rotation/internal rotation ratio. The current research aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of shoulder concentric rotation strength in competitive swimmers using an isokinetic dynamometer. The study enrolled 35 competitive swimmers aged between 13 and 19 years. Concentric movements were performed including internal and external rotations of the shoulder joint following the instructions of the standardized protocol. The angular velocity of the test was defined at 60/s. Outcome measures were peak torque (Nm) and work (J), measured in both, the dominant and non-dominant arms. The external rotation/internal rotation ratio was also calculated. Reliability was excellent for peak torque and work. For the external rotation/internal rotation ratio, the ICC oscillated between 0.744 and 0.860 for the work ratio of the non-dominant arm and the peak torque ratio of the dominant arm, respectively. In general terms, better reliability was observed for peak torque compared with work, for external rotation compared with internal rotation, and for the dominant arm compared with the non-dominant one. © 2018 Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics.

AB  - We consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic annular flows around a circular island with a radial offshore bottom slope. Since the conical bottom topography causes a certain beta effect, by analogy with the conventional beta plane we term our model a beta cone. Our focus is on the flows with zero total circulation, which are composed of two concentric rings of uniform potential vorticity (PV) attached to the island. The linear stability of such flows on a beta cone was investigated in a previous publication of ours. In the present paper, we study numerically the nonlinear evolution of weakly viscous flows, whose parameters are fitted so as to guarantee the highest instability of the azimuthal mode. We study the production of vortices and Rossby waves due to the instability, consider the effect of waves on the emerging vortices and the interaction between the vortices. As in the flat-bottom case, at, the instability at weak bottom slopes normally leads to the emission of dipoles. However, a fundamental difference between the flat-bottom and beta-cone cases is observed in the trajectories of the dipoles as the latter recede from the island. When the flow is initially counterclockwise, the conical beta effect may force the dipoles to make a complete turn, come back to the island and rearrange in new couples that again leave the island and return. This quasi-periodic process gradually fades due to filamentation, wave radiation and viscous dissipation. Another possible outcome is symmetrical settling of dipoles in a circular orbit around the island, in which they move counterclockwise. This behaviour is reminiscent of the adaptation of strongly tilted beta-plane modons (dipoles) to the eastward movement. If the initial flow is clockwise, the emerged dipoles usually disintegrate, but sometimes, the orbital arrangement is possible. At a moderate slope, the evolution of an unstable flow, which is initially clockwise, may end up in the formation of a counterclockwise flow. At steeper slopes, a clockwise flow may transform into a quasi-stationary vortex multipole. When the slope is sufficiently steep, the topographic Rossby waves developing outside of the PV rings can smooth away the instability crests and troughs at the outer edge of the main flow, thus preventing the vortex production but allowing the formation of a new quasi-stationary pattern, a doubly connected coherent PV structure possessing-fold symmetry. Such an-fold pattern can be steady only if it rotates counterclockwise, otherwise it radiates Rossby waves and transforms eventually into a circularly symmetric flow. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.

During the SSC, the pre-activated muscle is lengthened in the braking or plyometric phase (i.e., eccentric phase) followed by an immediate muscle shortening in the push off or myometric phase (i.e., concentric phase). However, it is to be assumed that 95% of sport-related movements are conducted in the SSC. Reactive strength training represents an effective mode of exercise to improve in particular throwing and jumping performances. It contributes positively to improved agility, speed of action, and other performance indicators in handball. Furthermore, reactive strength training supports positively the prevention of sport-related injuries, e.g., knee and ankle injuries, and helps to regain pre-injury performance level in athletes. A systematic and progressive training approach is presented during all stages of long-term athlete development to induce adaptive changes following reactive strength training and to increase the likelihood of transferring a talented young player into an elite athlete. The specific training variables of reactive strength training, such as exercise selection, training frequency, exercise order, training load and repetitions, and training volume as well as the technical correctness and movement quality of the exercise, have to be systematically controlled and gradually adjusted according to the development of the athletes. © ESSKA 2018.

AB  - In the ecological literature, many models for the predator-prey interactions have been well formulated but partially analyzed. Assuming this analysis to be true and complete, some authors use that results to study a more complex relationship among species (food webs). Others employ more sophisticated mathematical tools for the analysis, without further questioning. The aim of this paper is to extend, complement and enhance the results established in an earlier article referred to a modified Leslie-Gower model. In that work, the authors proved only the boundedness of solutions, the existence of an attracting set, and the global stability of a single equilibrium point at the interior of the first quadrant. In this paper, new results for the same model are proven, establishing conditions in the parameter space for which up two positive equilibria exist. Assuming there exists a unique positive equilibrium point, we have proved, the existence of: i) a separatrix curve σ, dividing the trajectories in the phase plane, which can have different ω - limit, ii) a subset of the parameter space in which two concentric limit cycles exist, the innermost unstable and the outermost stable. Then, there exists the phenomenon of tri-stability, because simultaneously, it has: a local stable positive equilibrium point, a stable limit cycle, and an attractor equilibrium point over the vertical axis. Therefore, we warn the model studied have more rich and interesting properties that those shown that earlier papers. Numerical simulations and a bifurcation diagram are given to endorse the analytical results. © 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - In order to ensure the concentricity accuracy of frame-like thinwalled parts, this paper takes the rotating frame as a machining example. And using the method of finite element simulation and calculation, this paper analyzes the main factors that cause the error of coaxiality of the rotating frame. Because the clamping force of the clamping device causes the deformation of the workpiece, this article is based on the finite element simulation to improve the clamping method. By adding a fixing block at the bottom of the frame and clamping with the fixing block to avoid direct pressure on the rotating frame, the error of frame concentricity caused by the clamping deformation is reduced in this way. Aiming at the error caused by machine error, this paper improves the clamping device and adds the calibration mechanism to correct the machine error and ensure the coaxial accuracy. Through the application of the improved method proposed in this paper, the concentricity error of the rotating frame can be guaranteed within 0-0.005mm. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Investigations of trunk strength with high-level athletes are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare maximal concentric isokinetic trunk extension and flexion torque, power, and strength ratios between high-level weightlifters (n = 20), wrestlers (n = 20) and a control (n = 25) population. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to evaluate peak torque, power and strength ratios during seated trunk extension/flexion actions at 60°/s and 180°/s. There were no significant anthropometric differences between groups. Overall, trunk isokinetic force variables as a function of the increase in angular velocity, showed a decrease in peak torque, but an increase in power (athletes and controls). Compared to the control group, athletes demonstrated significantly higher trunk extension torque (+67.05 N·m, ES = 0.81) and power (+49.28 N·m, ES = 0.82) at 60°/s and 180°/s, respectively. Athletes produced significantly greater trunk flexion-extension ratios at 60°/s and 180°/s (ES = 0.80-0.47) than controls. Weightlifters and wrestlers exhibited significantly higher extensor than flexor torque at all angular velocities. Weightlifters demonstrated greater torque (ES = 0.79) than wrestlers at 60°/s. The wrestlers' average power was significantly higher (ES = 0.43) than weightlifters at 180°/s. There were no significant ratio differences between wrestlers (66.23%) and weightlifters (72.06%). Weightlifters had stronger extensor muscles at 60°/s, whereas wrestlers had higher power at 180°/s for extensor muscles. It was postulated that the extensor muscles were stronger than the flexors to ensure trunk stabilisation, and for prevention of injuries. These differences seem to be associated to the movements that occur in each sport in terms of both muscle actions and contractile forces. © 2019 Amira Ben Moussa Zouita, Sghaier Zouita, Catherine Dziri, Matt Brughelli, David G.

AB  - When it comes to monstrosity and geography, isolated geographical locations usually act as the center of monstrosity. However, in the Japanese manga series Attack on Titan, written and illustrated by manga artist Isayama Hajime, it is humanity that is isolated from the outside world. The serialization of the series began in September 2009 and has been collected into 13 volumes as of April 2014. Attack on Titan is set in a fictional world where human cities are surrounded by three enormous concentric walls. Human beings live within the walls to protect themselves from the Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures that swallow humans for unknown reasons. At the beginning of the story, the outermost wall is destroyed by an outsized Titan. This event leads to the invasion of the Titans and the destruction of human communities, families, and the social system within the walls. The attacks of the Titans reduce the realm of human world. Humans must repeatedly redefine self and otherness to survive with limited resources. The disasters gradually uncover the evil of human beings. The investigations and adventures of the protagonist and his friends reveal that humans can transform themselves into Titans. At the same time, it turns out that the walls protecting humans are actually formed by petrified Titans. I argue that these findings blur the boundary between the human world within and the chaotic world without. The blurred definition of the safe world challenges the concept of self and otherness, normal and aberrant. The geographical uncertainty reflects the obscurity of the line between humanity and monstrosity in the human society, and questions the necessity of this distinction. © Inter-Disciplinary Press 2016.

AB  - Alexithymia refers to difficulties in identifying, differentiating, and describing feelings. This personality trait is highly prevalent in many psychiatric conditions and may drive associated social-emotional problems, including the ability to decode emotions in faces. This study probed alexithymic problems with identifying clear and ambiguous blends of emotions in faces and their underlying visual attention patterns. Using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, students with high alexithymia (HA, n = 73) or low alexithymia (LA, n = 76) were enrolled in this study. Participants judged the mixture ratio of emotional expressions while their eye movements were recorded. Controlling for group differences in mood and anxiety, HA showed similar accuracy but a reduced viewing preference of facial eye regions compared to LA (p = .02). More attention to the eye regions was related to lower accuracy in HA (p = .02) but to slightly higher accuracy in LA (p = .07). The current findings point to a role of alexithymia in attentional avoidance of other people's eyes, similar to previous findings in autism spectrum disorder. Eye contact may be perceived as a greater emotional challenge by those with alexithymia, disrupting downstream processing of facial emotions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Following its eradication in the Alps in the early 1900s, the Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus has been reintroduced in four Alpine regions since 1986. The first successful breeding since this reintroduction into the wild occurred in 1997 in the western Alps, and in 1998 in the Central Alps, thereby establishing two subpopulations. Here, we focus on the growth and the settlement patterns of one of the major subpopulations of reintroduced Bearded Vulture, that of the Central Alps. By 2015 there were 15 breeding pairs in the Central Alps, and the density within the core area was strikingly higher (18.8 pairs/1000 km2) than that outside it (overall density 3.4 pairs/1000 km2). New pairs showed high natal philopatry when settling, with maximum distances of 49.2 km from the nearest release sites. Among identified birds, born or released within the Central Alps, 85% (n = 26) paired and settled within this subpopulation and only four birds emigrated to the west. Three birds immigrated from the east or the west. Both the number of pairs and of offspring increased exponentially between 1998 and 2015. The growth of the Central Alpine subpopulation was characterized by concentric and continuous growth around the release sites. Moreover, there was an increase in the density of pairs within the core area. Possible explanations for the high natal philopatry observed include adaptive genetic components, abundant food resources and conspecific attraction. As a consequence of the substantial population increase, releases in the Central Alpine subpopulation were stopped after 2008. The population has grown almost exclusively on the basis of wild-born birds since then, and has become a major subpopulation of the Bearded Vulture in the Alps. © 2017, Dt.

AB  - Mimicry is very common for insects, displayed in various stages of eggs, nymphs, larvae, pupae or adults. Since eye-to-eye has a powerful impact on vertebrates, eyespots become an important anti-predation strategy for diurnal insects and other animals. In today's ecosystems, eyespots are still one of important self-defense methods for insects, especially for extant Lepidoptera. There are many documented examples of camouflage by various fossil insects of Odonata, Orthoptera, Homoptera, Neuroptera and Mecoptera from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota and the Middle Jurassic Yanliao Biota in the Northeastern China. Some fossil insects have dark spots and markings with various sizes irregularly distributed on their wings. A typical mimicry system comprises three parties: mimic, model and dupe. To ensure that mimicry occurs, all three parties should, to some extent, co-exist in the same living ecosystem at the same time. © 2019 JohnWiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biological microswimmers exhibit versatile strategies for sensing and navigating their environment, such as run-and-tumble and curvature modulation. Here, we report a striking phototactic behaviour of the microswimmer Euglena gracilis, where these eukaryotic cells swim in polygonal trajectories due to a sudden increase in light intensity. While smoothly curved trajectories are common for microswimmers, such quantized ones have not been reported previously. We find that this polygonal behaviour emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming and spinning behaviours. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection and cellular reorientation, accounting for all three behavioural states. Coordinated switching between these behaviours selects for ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive or subdiffusive motion (including tuning the effective diffusion constant over several orders of magnitude), thereby enabling navigation in spatially structured light fields, such as edge avoidance and gradient descent. This feedback control links multiple system scales (flagellar beats, cellular behaviours and phototaxis strategies), with implications for other natural and synthetic microswimmers. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Separate-layer injection of CO2 is an important method to improve oil and gas production and recovery. Conventional single-stage nozzle is usually blocked by impurities, and the ice-barrier phenomenon is very common. To solve this problem, large-diameter multi-stage circumfluence nozzle was designed to release pressure stage by stage. In order to illuminate the throttle characteristics of the CO2 multi-stage circumfluence nozzles, numerical simulation was performed to test several nozzles with different diameters and stage numbers. Furthermore, we tested the throttle characteristics through laboratory experiments and obtained the effects of several critical parameters such as nozzle diameter, number of stage and pressure drop on the throttle characteristics. The results show that the flow rate decreases as the nozzle stage increases on the condition of constant pressure and nozzle diameter. And pressure difference increases as nozzle stage number increases under the constant flow rate. The throttle capability of multi-stage circumfluence nozzles was much better than the concentric nozzles. Large-diameter multi-stage nozzle is recommended rather than small-diameter single-stage nozzle during the process of separate-layer injection, which can efficiently prevent impurities and ice blocking. The results are expected to provide a theoretical support for the nozzle choice of separate-layer injection of CO2. © 2018 Southwest Petroleum University

AB  - Deflection occurs in predator-prey interactions where prey possess traits that influence the position of the predator's initial contact with the prey's body in a way that enhances the prey's probability of survival when attacked. As an anti-predatory defence occurring late in the sequence of an attack, deflection is an understudied but fascinating strategy that involves a range of unusual adaptations in diverse prey species. Deflective traits have been postulated to be important to the defensive strategies of a range of organisms, but although evidence for their existence is variable among groups, we argue that previous research neglects some promising taxa. As a defence, deflection will probably play a crucial role in the behavioural ecology and evolution of both prey species and their predators; as such, it warrants greater interest from zoologists. Here, we first summarize what is known about deflection from the current literature. We next offer predictions about the co-evolutionary possibilities surrounding deflection, based on the benefits and costs experienced by prey and their predators. Finally, we outline the most interesting outstanding avenues for future research in the field of deflection and make new suggestions as to how they could be explored usefully. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - The goal of this article is two fold. First, using transcendental shift-like automorphisms of Ck, k ≥ 3 we construct two examples of non-degenerate entire mappings with prescribed ranges. The first example exhibits an entire mapping of Ck, k ≥ 3 whose range avoids a given polydisc but contains the complement of a slightly larger concentric polydisc. This generalizes a result of Dixon–Esterle in C2. The second example shows the existence of a Fatou–Bieberbach domain in Ck, k ≥ 3 that is constrained to lie in a prescribed region. This is motivated by similar results of Buzzard and Rosay–Rudin. In the second part we compute the order and type of entire mappings that parametrize one dimensional unstable manifolds for shift-like polynomial automorphisms and show how they can be used to prove a Yoccoz type inequality for this class of automorphisms. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The requirement to safe and economical buildings caused to the exploitation of nonlinear capacity structures and optimization of them. This requirement leads to forming seismic design method based on performance. In this study, concentrically braced frames (CBFs) have been optimized at the immediate occupancy (IO) and collapse prevention (CP) levels. Minimizing structural weight is taken as objective function subjected to performance constraints on inter-story drift ratios at various performance levels. In order to evaluate the seismic capacity of the CBFs, pushover analysis is conducted, and the process of optimization has been done by using Bee Algorithm. Results indicate that performance based design caused to have minimum structural weight and due to increase capacity of CBFs. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - A phase-retrieval attack free cryptosystem based on the cylindrical asymmetric diffraction and double-random phase encoding (DRPE) is proposed. The plaintext is abstract as a cylinder, while the observed diffraction and holographic surfaces are concentric cylinders. Therefore, the plaintext can be encrypted through a two-step asymmetric diffraction process with double pseudo random phase masks located on the object surface and the first diffraction surface. After inverse diffraction from a holographic surface to an object surface, the plaintext can be reconstructed using a decryption process. Since the diffraction propagated from the inner cylinder to the outer cylinder is different from that of the reversed direction, the proposed cryptosystem is asymmetric and hence is free of phase-retrieval attack. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed cryptosystem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Evaluation of psychogenic visual disorders is difficult by general ophthalmological examinations. Wide-range assessment of vision-related essential skills (WAVES), which was developed for evaluation of visual perception and visual cognitive function, was applied to 2 cases with psychogenic visual disorders. Cases: One was a 10-year-old girl. Corrected visual acuity was 0.2 right and 0.1 left. The visual field showed concentric contraction. Her parents had trouble and were living separately since one month before. The other was a 9-year-old girl. Corrected visual acuity was 0.3 in either eye. Her mother had started to work as a night shift, so that she had received less attention from her mother. Findings and Clinical Course: Both cases were diagnosed as psychogenic visual disorders after they were found free from ophthalmological or neurological abnormalities. WAVES showed normal eye and hand coordination, or ability to express visual information by hand motion, while visual perception was markedly impaired. Both cases showed normal visual acuity, visual field and WAVES one year later. Conclusion: These cases show that impaired visual perception may be associated with psychogenic visual disorders. WAVES promises to be useful in the diagnosis of higher-order visual dysfunction which is difficult to be diagnosed by routine ophthalmological examinations. © 2019 Igaku-Shoin Ltd.

AB  - Hintergrund: Changes in foot strike pattern by local muscle fatigue can increase the rate of injury in running. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of foot strike pattern and local muscle fatigue of the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors on plantar pressure distribution while running barefoot on a treadmill at three different speeds. Methods: The study included 52 male voluntary forefoot vs. rearfoot runners of similar age and body mass. Each group completed two tests, with an interval of 3-7 days. The fatigue protocol included the isometric maximum force test consisting of two sets with a maximum contraction and the isokinetic endurance test consisting of ten sets of six concentric contractions (10 s set break, ω=60°/s). Variance analysis with repeated measurements was used to check the differences. Results: The fatigue protocol reduces the efficiency of the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, which perform different foot strike functions during running. As expected, the plantar pressure distribution under the foot was different depending on the foot strike pattern and local muscle fatigue. The pressure maxima was reduced under the exposed foot regions after fatigue, that means the maximum pressure is reduced after local muscle fatigue. Conclusion: For injury prevention, the foot strike pattern should be varied to relieve in particular the foot area under the heel and the forefoot. In the case of forefoot strikers, checks should be made as to whether they are habitual forefoot strikers. © 2018, Dynamic Media Sales Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Minimally invasive procedures have gained ever-increasing popularity due to their advantages of smaller incisions, faster recoveries, fewer complications, and reduced scarring to name a few. With the force exertion and curvilinear flexibility at their distal end effectors, the continuum tubular robots have the potential to perform robot-assisted trans-orifice minimally invasive surgery, such as transnasal and transoral operations. During these procedures, it is important and challenging for the continuum tubular robot to automatically adjust its pose according to the target surgical sites and compensate for undesired disturbance, such as respiratory motions. In this paper, a singularity-avoidance visual servoing algorithm based on Jacobian Optimization has been proposed to improve safety and control continuum tubular robots based on intra-operative visual feedback in confined environments. Without the prior knowledge of robot kinematics or hand-eye calibration between the robot and the endoscope, the proposed model-free eye-in-hand visual servoing technique is capable of accomplishing the targeting tasks by adopting the safety-enhanced singularity avoidance mechanism and an efficient image-processing algorithm. The multiple experiments, including simulations, experiments conducted in a confined environment, and cadaveric studies, have been implemented and demonstrated to illustrate the superiority of the proposed singularity-avoidance visual servoing method. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Handball is a sport that requires an extensive variety of movements and has led to an increased incidence of ankle and knee injuries. Specifically, to knee joint, detection and reduction in muscular deficits can help prevent injuries and improve muscular performance. Isokinetic dynamometer is a highly effective and trustworthy assessment tool for such detections.Therefore,theobjectiveofthisstudywastoanalyzemuscularperformance,andthedifferencesbetweendominant and non-dominant limb of the knee extensors and flexors in adolescent handball athletes. Method: Data of isokinetic evaluation of knee muscles of 19 female handball players was obtained from a database and analyzed. The isokinetic dynamometer was used in a concentric-concentric mode for the knee extensors and flexors at angular velocities of 60°/s, 120°/s, 180°/s and 240°/s. Results: Mean values of peak torque or the flexor/extensor ratio were not statistically significant in the comparison between the limbs at any of the angular velocities. Furthermore, the flexor/extensor ratio values were between 50% and 80% that are described as normal in the literature of knee joint.; Conclusions: This study demonstrated that lower-limb dominance does not interfere in the muscular concentric isokinetic performance of the knee extensor and flexor muscles in adolescent handball athletes. Consequently, it can be suggested that handball athletes present lower risk of knee injuries when compared to sports that lead to some type of muscular asymmetries. © 2018 Archivos de Medicina del Deporte.

AB  - The Yaha high-pressure condensate gas field in the Tarim Basin has always been developed by maintaining the reservoir pressure through cyclic gas injection. The reservoir physical properties vary greatly between two major gas layers, and even in the same gas layer, so commingled gas injection not only leads to uneven reserves producing level, but also intensifies the production conflicts between high-permeability and low-permeability reservoirs. In this paper, separate-layer gas injection strings with concentric tubing were designed on the basis of gas well structures, the ground facility conditions and separate-layer gas injection requirements. Then, the corresponding wellhead equipments were supported. And in this way, a separate-layer gas injection well was completed and put into operation and the technical requirements of separate-layer gas injection were satisfied. And in addition, two combination modes of tubing were designed for concentric tubing programs, i.e., Ø114.3 mm + Ø73.0 mm and Ø114.3 mm + Ø60.3 mm. And both of them were theoretically analyzed and evaluated in terms of wellbore temperature and pressure fields and string safety at different allocations. It is shown that the required wellhead gas injection pressure is lower than 42 MPa when the maximum gas injection rate is up to 50×104 m3 and 20×104 m3/d respectively in the internal and external tubing of the former combination of Ø114.3 mm + Ø73.0 mm. And based on the existing ground gas injection facilities, the pressure can be reached with less gas injection pressure difference between the internal tubing and the external tubing, which is favorable for gas injection. The safety coefficient of this former tubing combination is higher than the common one (1.5). The first and second gas injection conditions were verified in terms of internal pressure strength and the third and fourth were verified in terms of external extrusion strength. It is demonstrated that this combination can meet the strength requirements. It is concluded that the tubing combination of Ø114.3 mm + Ø73.0 mm is feasible for separate-layer gas injection strings with concentric tubing. © 2016, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

AB  - Stone fruit is cooled after harvesting to extend its shelf life and prevent postharvest losses. Because it is quickly subject to chilling injuries at inappropriate temperatures, its thermal properties should be known in order to design an optimum cooling process. However, how long does it take for an olive to reach its storage temperature at the stone–pulp interface? This paper proposes approximated equations as a model for predicting cooling times at the stone–pulp interface and for measuring the thermal diffusivity of the pulp and the external heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on a solution in Fourier series for the conduction of heat in spheres with an inner concentric, insulating spherical core, as a model of conduction of heat in stone fruits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and IIR

AB  - ASEAN throughout its existence faced a number of challenges including dramatic changes in the security framework of a particularly turbulent region as well as the financial crisis of the late 1990s and the multiple controversies among its Member States and the influence of changing neighbouring powers. In order to survive it had, on the one hand, to be flexible enough to cope with the challenges of internal diversity, territorial integrity and the political fragility of regimes in South-East Asia. On the other hand, it had to be sufficiently innovative to be able to face bilateral territorial tensions and huge regional security challenges. The ASEAN success is especially evident given the poor record of other Asian regional organizations. The current article provides a striking comparison of its achievements with the lack of substantive results of SAARC grouping in South East Asia. It furthermore claims that lessons derived from the ASEAN practices could be relevant for relatively successful integration blocks, such-as the European Union and Eurasian integration process. In its internal processes the ASEAN way proved to be an effective method for organizing regional cooperation. It avoided on the one hand the standing European conflict between intergovernmental and community methods and was able to show the huge potential of various intergovernmental networking in supporting further progresse in deepening and widening regional cooperation. On the other hand, the ASEAN way is a bottom-up method excluding hierarchical decision making and a single country supremacy. In terms of organizing relations with external partners the Association positioned itself as not only Asia's most important regional organization, but also the driving agent for a regional order in trade, economic, security, and identity needs. The practice of concentric circles of partnerships proved flexible enough and able of combining political leadership of the hard core (ASEAN centrality) with openness and inclusiveness, at various degrees of near and far partners. The challenges ahead are internal fragmentation and, in particular, the potentially dividing pressure of security challenges in the neighbouring area, often deepened by power politics of great global actors like China and USA.

AB  - Background/Objective Evaluating hamstring strength by isokinetic dynamometry is limited by various practical issues such as time and cost. A video-based Nordic hamstring exercise is introduced as an alternative option. The aims of this study are to evaluate 1.) the between-session reliability and 2.) concurrent validity of the testing method compared to a standardized isokinetic dynamometry. Methods Thirty male elite footballers were recruited for the study. From the Nordic hamstring exercise, the video-analysis-determined Nordic break-point angles where the participant could no longer withstand the force of the fall (eccentric mode) and the number of seconds that the player could hold at 30° forward flexion angle (isometric mode) were measured. Intra-class correlation coefficients for between-session reliability, Pearson r correlations between the current method and isokinetic dynamometry were calculated. Results The reliability of the eccentric mode was moderate (ICC (2,1) = 0.82) while that of isometric mode was poor (ICC (2,1) = 0.57). The Nordic break-point angle of the eccentric mode significantly correlated with the concentric and eccentric hamstring peak torque (r = 0.48 and 0.58, p < 0.001), while the isometric was not (r = 0.02 - 0.07, p > 0.05). Conclusion The eccentric mode of the video-based hamstring strength test was a moderately reliable and valid method to measure the eccentric hamstring strength in elite football players. © 2017

AB  - BAKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine how hip, knee and ankle kinetics and kinematics influence effective impulse production during countermovement jumps. METHODS: Eighteen semi-professional soccer players (22.8±2.2 years) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants completed three maximal countermovement jumps on two force platforms (1000 Hz) that were linked to a nine camera infrared motion capture system (500 Hz). RESULTS: Kinetic and kinematic data revealed jumpers who fail to achieve uniform ground reaction force curves that result in optimal impulse production during their jump always display hip adduction and or hip internal rotation during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump. The variation of hip adduction and or internal rotation likely represents failed joint transition during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump and appears to account for a non-uniform force trace seen in these jumpers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest rehabilitation and conditioning exercises for injury prevention and performance may benefit from targeting frontal and transverse plane movement. © 2016 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

AB  - Our knowledge of wing pattern formation in Lepidoptera has advanced significantly in recent years due to the careful examination of several groups of butterflies. The eyespot is a prominent feature of Lepidoptera wing pattern, especially in the family Saturniidae. The present study examined how sulfated polysaccharides affected the wing pattern formation of the Io moth, Automeris io (Saturniidae). Prepupae and pupae of this species were subjected to injections of heparin and cold shock. While the cold shock had little to no effect on wing pattern, the aberrations resulting from heparin injections were moderate to profound and depended on the dose and the stage at which injection was made. The changes consisted of expansion of the black ring around the dorsal hindwing eyespots and distortion of discal spots on both dorsal and ventral sides of forewings, suggesting a possible link between genetic controls of these elements. Several different types of scales form the normal color pattern of Automeris io, and heparin-induced changes correspond to changes in shape of scales. The resulting aberrations are dubbed 'Black Eye' and 'Comet Eye.' Other known aberrations of Automeris io eyespots are summarized, illustrated, and named. © 2017 Sourakov A.

AB  - This paper proposes a new method for the pattern synthesis of sparse concentric circular array. This method can avoid the premature and improve the poor capability of local optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. Alternatively implementing the two kinds of genetic breeding operations can effectively alleviate the dependence of the algorithm's convergence on the choice of the initial group. This paper takes the nine-ringed concentric circular array as simulation object. The results show that the number of array elements can be decreased from 278 to 140 with the simultaneous reduction in peak sidelobe level to -21.27dB, and the distortion of mainlobe is avoided. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the increasing use of vehicle bombs on attacking important buildings by terrorist organizations around the world, it is necessary to design buildings with more resistance against blast loads. In this research, numerical studies have been done for threedimensional structural models of special moment frames, concentrically braced frames, and eccentrically braced frames with 3, 5, and 10 stories. The nonlinear dynamic method is applied for analyzing the models under two different levels of straight and oblique blast loadings based on the UFC 3-340-02. The plastic hinge rotations, ductility ratios, performance levels, and flexural moments in the models are obtained from the analysis and compared with each other. According to the results, it can be said that the eccentrically braced frame systems generally show better performances than other systems under blast loadings. Also due to different shock directions, the values of column plastic rotations and bending moments under oblique blast loadings are less than straight ones. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - To investigate the effect of within match fatigue on knee kinematics and jump kinetics in girls' soccer players, a quasi-experiment time series design was employed collecting data before, after and at 15-min intervals during a 90-min simulated soccer match. 15 girl players (age 13.1±1.4 years) performed a counter movement jump and a single-leg drop jump. Mean concentric force and flight time to contraction time ratio were derived from the counter movement jump. Knee valgus and flexion angles were calculated during the single-leg drop from 3-dimensional motion capture. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and readiness were collected at each time series. Small to large increases in RPE and reductions in readiness were observed throughout the match from baseline. Moderate to large improvements in mean concentric force were shown at 15, 75 and 90-min when compared to baseline. Flight time to contraction time ratio increased moderately at 15 min. Changes in kinematics were typically trivial or unclear however, small increases in knee valgus were shown after 30 min compared to baseline. Subjective measures may provide useful information to understand the physical response of young players to match play. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - Many insects produce sounds when attacked by a predator, yet the functions of these signals are poorly understood. It is debated whether such sounds function as startle, warning or alarm signals, or merely serve to augment other defences. Direct evidence is limited owing to difficulties in disentangling the effects of sounds from other defences that often occur simultaneously in live insects. We conducted an experiment to test whether an insect sound can function as a deimatic (i.e. startle) display. Variations of a whistle of the walnut sphinx caterpillar (Amorpha juglandis) were presented to a predator, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), when birds activated a sensor while feeding on mealworms (Tenebrio molitor). Birds exposed to whistles played back at natural sound levels exhibited significantly higher startle scores (by flying away, flinching, and hopping) and took longer to return to the feeding dish than during control conditions where no sounds were played. Birds habituated to sounds during a one-hour session, but after two days the startling effects were restored. Our results provide empirical evidence that an insect sound alone can function as a deimatic display against an avian predator. We discuss how whistles might be particularly effective ‘acoustic eye spots’ on avian predators. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acquired color vision deficiency occurs as the result of ocular, neurologic, or systemic disease. A wide array of conditions may affect color vision, ranging from diseases of the ocular media through to pathology of the visual cortex. Traditionally, acquired color vision deficiency is considered a separate entity from congenital color vision deficiency, although emerging clinical and molecular genetic data would suggest a degree of overlap. We review the pathophysiology of acquired color vision deficiency, the data on its prevalence, theories for the preponderance of acquired S-mechanism (or tritan) deficiency, and discuss tests of color vision. We also briefly review the types of color vision deficiencies encountered in ocular disease, with an emphasis placed on larger or more detailed clinical investigations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Day-camouflaged leaf-mimic katydids Typophyllum spp. have a remarkable way of evading predators as male and female forewings appear as bite-damaged leaves complete with necrotic spots. As in all other katydids, males produce sound signals to attract females by rubbing their forewings together. The biophysical properties of these special leaf-like forewings remain obscure. Here we study the wing mechanics and resonances of Typophyllum spurioculis, a new species of leaf-mimic katydid with a broad distribution in the Andes from Western Ecuador to the middle Central Cordillera in Colombia. This species performs an unusual laterally directed aposematic display, showing orange spots that simulate eyes at the leg base. At night, males are conspicuous by their loud, audible calling songs, which exhibit two spectral peaks at ca. 7 and 12 kHz. Using micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometry we find the effective sound radiators of the wings (speculae) vibrate with three modes of vibration, two of which include the frequencies observed in the calling song. Remarkably, this resonance is preserved in the parts of the wings mimicking necrotic leaves, which are in theory not specialised for sound production. The eyespot function is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The concentrically layered thermal cloaks with isotropic materials could realize the equivalent thermal cloaking effect with Pendry's cloak, while the effectiveness is scarcely investigated quantitatively. Here we examine the cloaking effectiveness quantitatively by evaluating the standard deviation of the temperature difference between the simulated plane with the layered thermal cloak and Pendry's thermal cloak. The design rules for the isotropic materials in terms of thermal conductivity and layer thickness are presented. The present method could quantitatively evaluate the cloaking effectiveness, and could open avenues for analyzing the cloaking effect, detecting the (anti-) cloaks, etc. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Basketball is one of the most popular and most practiced sports in the world, being played by 450 million people worldwide, and the knee is the most commonly injured region of the body involving adolescent male basketball players. Isokinetic dynamometry is generally considered the best protocol for dynamic strength measurements, which are important for preventing musculoskeletal injuries.Therefore, the objective of the present study was to analyze the muscular performance, the unilateral differences and relationships between the knee extensor and flexor muscles in adolescent male basketball players. Method:The information provided by database concerning the isokinetic evaluation of the knee extensor and flexor muscles from 21 male basketball players under the age of 15 were analyzed. The isokinetic dynamometer was used in a concentric- concentric mode for the knee extensor and flexor muscles at angular velocities of 60°/s, 1207s, 1807s, and 2407s. Results: The results demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the dominant limb and the nondominant limb at the considered velocities, whether for mean peak torque values or for the flexor/extensor ratio. Another important result showed flexor/extensor ratios within normal values for knee joints. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that lower-limb dominance does not interfere in the muscular concentric isokinetic performance of the knee extensor and flexor muscles in adolescent male basketball players. We believe that the short time spent in basketball's practice (mean time was 2.46 years) appears to be responsible for these results because the adolescent athletes evaluated in this study did not show differences between limbs, in contrast to studies involving older male basketball players.

AB  - Seasonal polyphenism in insects is the phenomenon whereby multiple phenotypes can arise from a single genotype depending on environmental conditions during development. Many butterflies have multiple generations per year, and environmentally induced variation in wing color pattern phenotype allows them to develop adaptations to the specific season in which the adults live. Elements of butterfly color patterns are developmentally semiautonomous allowing for detailed developmental and evolutionary changes in the overall color pattern. This developmental flexibility of the color pattern can result in extremely diverse seasonal phenotypes in a single species. In this study, we asked the following questions: (a) How do wing phenotype elements such as shape and pattern vary between seasonal forms? (b) Can this variation be explained phylogenetically? (c) If so, what are the various pattern development strategies used to achieve crypsis in the dry season form? To answer these questions, we used high-resolution images to analyze pattern element variation of 34 seasonally polyphenic butterfly species belonging to the tribe Junoniini (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). We show that forewing shape and eyespot size both vary seasonally and that the methods by which phenotype elements change in the dry season forms are different in different clades and may therefore have independent and diverse evolutionary origins. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The marine dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium possesses an ocelloid, the most elaborate photoreceptor organelle known in a unicellular organism, and a piston, a fast contractile appendage unknown in any other organism. The ocelloid is able to rotate, often before the cell swims. The ocelloid contains lenses that function to concentrate light. The flagellar propulsion is atrophied, and the piston is responsible for locomotion through successive extensions and contractions. During the “locomotion mode”, the contraction is ~4 times faster than the extension. The piston attained up to 50 mm · s−1 and the cell jumps backwards at −4 mm · s−1, while during the piston extension the cell moves forwards. The net speed of ~−1 mm · s−1 is faster than other dinoflagellates. The piston usually moved in the “static mode” without significant cell swimming. This study suggests that the piston is also a tactile organelle that scans the surrounding waters for prey. Erythropsidinium feeds on copepod eggs by engulfing. The end of the piston possesses a “suction cup” able to attach the prey and place it into the posterior cavity for engulfing. The cylindrical shape of Erythropsidinium, and the anterior position of the ocelloid and nucleus, are morphological adaptations that leave space for the large vacuole. Observations are provided on morphological development during cell division. Most of the described species of Erythropsidinium apparently correspond to distinct life stages of known species, and the genus Greuetodinium (=Leucopsis) corresponds to an earlier division stage. © 2017 Phycological Society of America

AB  - Managing crop viruses is difficult due to complex interactions among vectors, reservoirs, and mediating factors such as land cover. Identifying the appropriate ecological neighborhood, or the spatial area in which the most influential interactions occur affecting virus epidemiology, would therefore be beneficial in exposing which of the many explanatory variables to target in the plant-pathogen system. We constructed partial least squares path models to find the neighborhood size for vectors of stylet-borne nonpersistent viruses infecting pumpkins, and compare the relative influence of within-field and extra-field land cover. Two economically important aphid-vectored viruses in the U.S. Midwest are included in these analyses: papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). In 2010 and 2011, we used commercial pumpkin fields to quantify virus infection, vector (aphid) alightment (i.e., landing rates), and within-field weed communities, and subsequently analyzed extra-field cover from 1 to 5 km concentric buffer zones within the surrounding landscape. Alightment rates of total noncolonizing vectors and the top three numerically dominant species (Aphis craccivora Koch, Therioaphis trifolii (Monell), and Rhopalosiphum padi [L.]) were included in individual path models. Overall, we found that extra-field landscape composition had a far stronger influence on vector alightment than within-field weed cover; this pattern was consistent for seven of eight statistical models. In one exception, weed cover influenced alightment of the putative PRSV vector, A. craccivora, while surrounding landscape had no effect. In this case, weed coverage and vector alightment were inversely related, demonstrating that aphids were less likely to land in weed-infested fields. However, weed cover did not predict alightment of T. trifolii or total noncolonizers. The neighborhood size scales for total noncolonizers’ tended to be larger than for individual species (4–5 km), suggesting future studies of dispersal by multi-species aphid groups may benefit from an extended gradient. On balance, our results indicate that while surrounding land cover interactions are complex, they exert greater influence over vector dispersal than within-field weed cover, calling into question whether management of local weeds is an effective method of crop virus prevention in some systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite being the subject of widespread study, many aspects of thedevelopment of eyespot patterns in butterfly wings remain poorly understood. Inthis work, we examine, through numerical simulations, a mathematical model foreyespot focus point formation in which a reaction-diffusion system is assumed toplay the role of the patterning mechanism. In the model, changes in the boundaryconditions at the veins at the proximal boundary alone are capable of determiningwhether or not an eyespot focus forms in a given wing cell and the eventual positionof focus points within the wing cell. Furthermore, an auxiliary surface reactiondiffusionsystem posed along the entire proximal boundary of the wing cells isproposed as the mechanism that generates the necessary changes in the proximalboundary profiles. In order to illustrate the robustness of the model, we performsimulations on a curved wing geometry that is somewhat closer to a biologicalrealistic domain than the rectangular wing cells previously considered, and we alsoillustrate the ability of the model to reproduce experimental results on artificialselection of eyespots. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Core muscle imbalances and weak trunk strength are relevant for injury prevention and performance. Information regarding core strength requirements and ideal flexion/extension ratios in alpine skiing is limited. We aimed to compare trunk strength capacities in elite alpine skiers with those of a matched control group. The concentric maximal trunk flexion and extension of 109 elite skiers and 47 active controls were measured at 150°/s in a ballistic mode using the CON-TREX® TP 1000 test system. The relative flexion peak torque was higher in male ski racers (p = 0.003; 2.44 ± 0.30 Nm/kg) than in the controls (2.32 ± 0.42 Nm/kg). The relative peak torque for extension was 4.53 ± 0.65 Nm/kg in ski racers and 4.11 ± 0.52 Nm/kg in the controls (p = 0.001). Female athletes were significantly stronger in both, relative flexion force (p = 0.006; skiers 2.05 ± 0.22 Nm/kg; controls 1.74 ± 0.28 Nm/kg) and relative extension force (p = 0.001; skiers 3.55 ± 0.53 Nm/kg; controls 3.14 ± 0.48 Nm/kg). No significant differences were found in the ratios of flexion to extension forces in females and males. Ski racers are engaged in extensive strength training for both leg and trunk muscles, which explains the higher peak values. Both groups indicated a low ratio from 0.54-0.59, which represents high trunk extensor muscles strength relative to flexor muscles. © 2017.Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics 2017.

AB  - Purpose: To examine and compare sex-related differences in the functioning of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles and the isokinetic hamstrings eccentric-to-quadriceps concentric functional ratio (H/QFUNC). Methods: Fifty male and 46 female young adults completed this study. Each participant carried out an isokinetic assessment to determine isokinetic concentric and eccentric torques during knee extension and flexion actions at 3 different angular velocities (60, 180 and 300°/s) adopting a lying position. The H/QFUNC was calculated using peak torque (PT) values and 3 different joint-angle-specific torque values (15°, 30° and 45° of knee extension). A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the results, and post hoc analyses using Friedman correction were employed. Results: There were statistically significant effects of angular velocity, joint angle and sex on the H/QFUNC (p < 0.01). Thus, the H/QFUNC ratio in both males and females decreases closer to full knee extension and with increasing movement velocity. The H/QFUNC was also significantly lower in females compared to males, irrespective of moment velocity and joint angle. Conclusions: The findings of the current study reinforce the need to examine the H/QFUNC ratio closer to full knee extension (where knee injury is most likely to occur) rather than using PT values which may not be as informative, as well as to focus preventive and rehabilitation training programmes on reducing quadriceps dominance by enhancing eccentric hamstring strength (especially in females who are at higher risk of injury).

AB  - The border ocelli and adjacent parafocal elements are among the most diverse and finely detailed features of butterfly wing patterns. The border ocelli can be circular, elliptical, and heart-shaped or can develop as dots, arcs, or short lines. Parafocal elements are typically shaped like smooth arcs but are also often "V," "W," and "M" shaped. The fusion of a border ocellus with its adjacent parafocal element is a common response to temperature shock and treatment with chemicals such as heparin and tungstate ions. Here I develop a new mathematical model for the formation of border ocelli and parafocal elements. The models are a reactiondiffusion model based on the well-established gradient-threshold mechanisms in embryonic development. The model uses a simple biochemical reaction sequence that is initiated at the wing veins and from there spreads across the field in the manner of a grass-fire. Unlike Turing-style models, this model is insensitive to the size of the field. Like real developmental systems, the model does not have a steady state, but the pattern is "read out" at a point in development, in response to an independent developmental signal such as a pulse of ecdysone secretion, which is known to regulate color pattern in butterflies. The grass-fire model reproduces the sequence of Distal-less expression that determines the position of eyespot foci and also shows how a border ocellus and its neighboring parafocal element can arise from such a single focus. The grass-fire model shows that the apparent fusion of ocellus and parafocal element is probably due to a premature termination of the normal process that separates the two and supports the hypothesis that the parafocal element is the distal band of the border symmetry system.

AB  - Jamming and anti-jamming technologies have become an important research topic within the GNSS discipline. While many GNSS receivers leave large space for signal dynamics, enough power space is left for the GNSS signals to be jammed. The goal of jamming is adding a noise to the satellite signal and fooling the receiver not to use signals plus noise for positioning calculations. The goal of spoofing is a falsification of the satellite signal and fooling the receiver to generate a false position; thus, misleading the navigator. This article discusses the experimental approach to anti-jamming and anti-spoofing based on the shielding of the antennas from the jammers and spoofers signals to develop an al- gorithm for the built-in protection system. In experimental studies, we used two types of screens: the metal funnel and the system of metallic concentric rings on a metal substrate. We also briey consider the commercial civilian and military jammers. The presented algorithm enables the development of an integrated vehicle safety system.

AB  - The urban environment poses novel anthropogenic challenges to wildlife. Some species have been noted for changes in their behavior in response to humans and urban-associated activities. Understanding the anthropogenic factors which influence these behavioral changes would contribute significantly to avian conservation in an increasingly urbanized world. We investigated the flight initiation distances (FIDs) and alert distances (ADs) of wild Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) in urban and rural habitats of southwestern Virginia to determine if wild songbirds' tolerances for human approaches differed by species or habitat type (urban or rural). We found Song Sparrows to be more tolerant than Northern Cardinals of human approaches, and urban birds of both species tended to tolerate closer approaches than did rural birds. We then investigated whether cues such as gaze direction or human figure explain differences in Song Sparrows' approach response behaviors. We found urban Song Sparrows' FIDs to be significantly shorter than rural birds' FIDs in response to treatments using a human approach for both direct and concealed gazes. However, no significant habitat differences were detected in response to the non-human approach treatments using umbrellas with and without eyespots. Our findings demonstrate risk-tolerance behaviors like AD and FID to vary greatly between species, habitats, and characteristics of the approach.

AB  - Physical exercise can induce brain plasticity and reduce the cognitive decline observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We investigated the effects of physical exercise to prevent or reverse spatial memory deficits produced by diabetes and some biochemical and immunohistochemical changes in hippocampal astrocytes of T1DM model. In this study, 56 male Wistar rats were divided in four groups: trained control (TC), non-trained control (NTC), trained diabetic (TD) and non-trained diabetic (NTD). 27 days after streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes, the exercise groups were submitted to 5 weeks of aerobic exercise. All groups were assessed in place recognition (PR) test before and after training. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes were evaluated using planar morphology, optical densitometry and Sholl's concentric circles method. Glucose and glutamate uptake, reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutamine synthetase (GS) levels were measured using biochemical assays. Our main results are: 1-Exercise reverses spatial memory impairments generated by T1DM; 2-Exercise increases GSH and GS in TC but not in TD rats; 3-Exercise increases density of GFAP positive astrocytes in the TC and TD groups and increases astrocytic ramification in TD animals. Our findings indicate that physical exercise reverses the cognitive deficits present in T1DM and induces important biochemical and immunohistochemical astrocytic changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Philosophical ‘thought experiments’ invoking inverted spectra, zombies, et cetera suggest that conscious sensations have no function, and psychological studies finding no correlation between vivid visual imaging and visual problem solving suggest that conscious images have no function. Furthermore, both philosophical and psychological theories suggest that self-consciousness has no function. Countering such suggestions, the post-Darwinian double-aspect theory which Professor Robert Kunzendorf’s introduces in the first chapter of his monograph On the Evolution of Conscious Sensation, Conscious Imagination, and Consciousness of Self points to evolutionary functions of certain sensations, youngling vivid images, and self-consciousness. Kunzendorf’s second chapter presents evidence that the most primitive sensation-pain, the subjective aspect of free nerve endings or nociceptors-has a survival-promoting function. But as the pressure nociceptor mutates into a touch receptor, the heat nociceptor into temperature receptor, and the chemical nociceptor into a taste receptor, the painful qualia of these nociceptors evolve respectively into touch sensation, temperature sensation, or taste sensation-painless sensations that add no survival benefit to their receptor’s physical aspect. Building on evidence that retinal receptors embodying visual qualia evolved from primitive eyespots responsive to injurious ‘heat at a distance’ or painful light, the third chapter presents evidence that visually imagined sensations are the subjective qualities of retinal receptors that are corticofugally innervated in warm-blooded animals-for the developmental purpose of testing cortically hypothesized sensory-motor rules that have greater survival value than cold-blooded stimulus-response associations. The fourth and final chapter focuses on self-conscious reality-testing and on visuo-spatial self-conceptualization, and presents evidence that such manifestations of self-awareness evolve only in those warm-blooded animals whose rule-developing youth lasts two years or longer-that is, those mammals and birds whose survival during the imaginal testing of rules is subjected to prolonged risk if self-consciousness that one is imaging sensations (rather than perceiving sensations) is absent. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Several classical studies of urban phenomena such as socioeconomic inequality and spatial segregation adopt the "concentric circles", or center/periphery model to characterize locations in urban space, according to which distance to CBD is the main determinant of high and low income classes positions. Contrasting to this coarse-grained view of the city, configurational analyses allow us to identify details in the street level, revealing how the urban fabric is connected and what are the roles of each space in several scales concerning both its proximity to all other spaces and its potential to channel flows between other pairs of spaces. In this paper, we examine the relationships between socioeconomic inequality and the position of different socioeconomic strata in Florianopolis' Conurbation Area (FCA). We build a multi-dimensional Socioeconomic Index from the 2010 Brazilian Census data and contrast it with configurational properties of the grid using the Theory of Space Syntax and its main measures (Integration and Choice). Several recurring patterns were identified, both at the global and local levels. Results show that more privileged groups tend to occupy areas that are highly accessible both in terms of Integration and Choice, but areas with the highest values in these measures are occupied by the cohorts immediately below. Despite higher global Choice averages, we found that upper cohorts tend to avoid locating themselves directly on main streets or highways, preferring, instead, a more inwards oriented location in relation to the foreground network. That seems to express a strategy which balances relative isolation-avoiding the negative effects of high intensity traffic such as air and noise pollution-with easy access to the city center. In the local level, grid discontinuities and the prevention of mutual visibility are the strategies utilized (often simultaneously) to separate two contrasting areas that, otherwise, are located near to each other.

AB  - The immature stages of the skipper butterfly Udranomia kikkawai from Brazil are described, including information on host plant use in cerrado savanna, shelter building behavior, and barcode sequences. The caterpillars feed on young leaves of two host food plants, Ouratea spectabilis and Ouratea hexasperma (Ochnaceae). The duration from egg hatching to adult eclosion averaged 30 days. Immature stages of U. kikkawai morphologically resemble those of other Hesperiidae by lacking head horns and complete lack of body scoli, and having a fusiform pupa with uniform color (except for mimetic false eye spots) and no projections. The young-leaf color of Udranomia caterpillars contrasts with that observed in the sister genus Drephalys, whose larvae are conspicuously colored. The food plant of Udranomia is also very uniform: all records are Ochnaceae across the distribution range of Udranomia. Based on molecular data, Brazilian populations correspond to the true U. kikkawai, which is part of a species complex that includes at least two additional undescribed species from Costa Rica. Our paper shows that free access to exchangeable database platforms can raise natural history studies to an integrative level that helps clarify patterns of diversity within taxonomically problematic groups. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Background: A hamstring strain injury (HSI) has become the most common noncontact injury in soccer. Isokinetic muscle strength deficits are considered a risk factor for HSIs. However, underpowered studies with small sample sizes unable to determine small associations have led to inconclusive results regarding the role of isokinetic strength and strength testing in HSIs. Purpose: To examine whether differences in isokinetic strength measures of knee flexion and extension represent risk factors for hamstring injuries in a large cohort of professional soccer players in an adequately powered study design. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 614 professional soccer players from 14 teams underwent isokinetic strength testing during preseason screening. Testing consisted of concentric knee flexion and extension at 60 deg/s and 300 deg/s and eccentric knee extension at 60 deg/s. A clustered multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with the risk of HSIs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine sensitivity and specificity. Results: Of the 614 players, 190 suffered an HSI during the 4 seasons. Quadriceps concentric strength at 60 deg/s (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03-1.92; P =.03) and hamstring eccentric strength at 60 deg/s (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.85; P =.04) adjusted for bodyweight were independently associated with the risk of injuries. The absolute differences between the injured and uninjured players were 6.9 N·m and 9.1 N·m, with small effect sizes (d < 0.2). The ROC analyses showed an area under the curve of 0.54 and 0.56 for quadriceps concentric strength and hamstring eccentric strength, respectively, indicating a failed combined sensitivity and specificity of the 2 strength variables identified in the logistic regression models. Conclusion: This study identified small absolute strength differences and a wide overlap of the absolute strength measurements at the group level. The small associations between lower hamstring eccentric strength and lower quadriceps concentric strength with HSIs can only be considered as weak risk factors. The identification of these risk factors still does not allow the identification of individual players at risk. The use of isokinetic testing to determine the association between strength differences and HSIs is not supported. © American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.

AB  - Purpose To determine the architectural adaptations of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) after concentric or eccentric strength training interventions and the time course of adaptation during training and detraining. Methods Participants in this intervention (concentric training group [n = 14], eccentric training group [n = 14], male infjects) completed a 4-wk control period, followed by 6 wk of either concentric-or eccentric-only knee flexor training on an isokinetic dynamometer and finished with 28 d of detraining. Architectural characteristics of BFlh were assessed at rest and during graded isometric contractions using two-dimensional ultrasonography at 28 d prebaseline; baseline; and days 14, 21, and 42 of the intervention and then again after 28 d of detraining. Results BFlh fascicle length was significantly longer in the eccentric training group (P < 0.05; d range, 2.65-2.98) and shorter in the concentric training group (P < 0.05; d range,-1.62 to-0.96) after 42 d of training compared with baseline at all isometric contraction intensities. After the 28-d detraining period, BFlh fascicle length was significantly reduced in the eccentric training group at all contraction intensities compared with the end of the intervention (P < 0.05; d range,-1.73 to-1.55). There was no significant change in fascicle length of the concentric training group after the detraining period. Conclusions These results provide evidence that short-term resistance training can lead to architectural alterations in the BFlh. In addition, the eccentric training-induced lengthening of BFlh fascicle length was reversed and returned to baseline values after 28 d of detraining. The contraction mode specific adaptations in this study may have implications for injury prevention and rehabilitation. © 2015 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

AB  - ATALANTE, a research unit located in Marcoule, is one of the main Nuclear Facilities of the French CEA. As concerns criticality risk prevention, this facility is divided into work units mostly managed through a mass control mode. The authorized limit is 350 g of fissile material with 239Pu-H2O as reference fissile medium. This mass limit was determined considering a reflection by 20 cm of water. Under these conditions, some neutronic reflectors which are more efficient than water can only be authorized in limited quantities. In ATALANTE the reflecting materials identified as requiring a specific form of management are lead, uranium (235U/Utotal = 1%), graphite, heavy water and beryllium. Initially a maximum permissible mass was determined for each of these materials taken separately. However, this method requires that when different reflectors are present simultaneously, the sum of the masses of all these reflectors must be less than the limit specified for the most penalizing of them. This rule has proved to be too restrictive for the operators. A new rule has therefore been implemented: the rule of fractions. Criticality calculations were performed to demonstrate that this rule is acceptable. The geometric configurations studied involved a sphere of 350 g of239Pu moderated by water and reflected by various masses of 2 to 6 reflectors (successions of concentric shells), followed by 20 cm of water. It was concluded that compliance with the new rule makes it possible to ensure criticality safety in the simultaneous presence of different reflectors. © 2016 American Nuclear Society.

AB  - In the present paper, the response of cylindrical storage tank foundation resting on stone column-reinforced ground has been studied considering the separation between the bottomraft and ground under liftoff condition. The bottomraft of the tank is idealized by a circular plate. The stone column-reinforced ground ismodeled as a tensionless foundation. Soft foundation soil and granular fill are idealized as a spring-dashpot element and Pasternak shear layer, respectively. Stone columns are modeled as stiff nonlinear springs. The stone columns are converted into equivalent concentric rings with one stone column at the center to simulate the axisymmetric condition for the analysis. The governing differential equations are derived fromthe classical theory of thin plate and solved using the finite-difference technique. Aparametric study is performed to investigate the differences between the response of tensionless and conventional elastic foundation systems. It is observed that tensionless foundation idealization is essential to analyze the liftoff and avoid erroneous design of the raft for the cylindrical storage tank. Recommendations are also suggested to avoid possible liftoff. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The focus of this paper is on presentation attack detection for the iris biometrics, which measures the pattern within the colored concentric circle of the subjects' eyes, to authenticate an individual to a generic user verification system. Unlike previous deep learning methods that use single convolutional neural network architectures, this paper develops a framework built upon triplet convolutional networks that takes as input two real iris patches and a fake patch or two fake patches and a genuine patch. The aim is to increase the number of training samples and to generate a representation that separates the real from the fake iris patches. The smaller architecture provides a way to do early stopping based on the liveness of single patches rather than the whole image. The matching is performed by computing the distance with respect to a reference set of real and fake examples. The proposed approach allows for real-time processing using a smaller network and provides equal or better than state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets of photo-based and contact lens presentation attacks. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Ability to recognize and differentiate between predators and non-predators is a crucial component of successful anti-predator behavior. While there is evidence that both genetic and experiential mechanisms mediate anti-predator behaviors in various animal species, it is unknown to what extent each of these two mechanisms are utilized by the green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Green monkeys on the West Indies island of Barbados offer a unique opportunity to investigate the underpinnings of anti-predator behaviors in a species that has been isolated from ancestral predators for over 350 years. In the first experiment, monkeys in two free-ranging troops were presented with photographs of an ancestral predator (leopard, Panthera pardus) and a non-predator (African Buffalo, Syncerus caffer). Relative to non-predator stimuli, images of a leopard elicited less approach, more alarm calls, and more escape responses. Subsequent experiments were conducted to determine whether the monkeys were responding to a leopard-specific feature (spotted fur) or a general predator feature (forward facing eyes). The monkeys showed similar approach to images of an unfamiliar non-predator regardless of whether the image had forward facing predator eyes or side facing non-predator eyes. However, once near the images, the monkeys were less likely to reach for peanuts near the predator eyes than the non-predator eyes. The monkeys avoided an image of spotted leopard fur but approached the same image of fur when the dark spots had been removed. Taken together, the results suggest that green monkey anti-predator behavior is at least partially mediated by genetic factors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present work, combustion instabilities of a modular combustor are investigated. The combustor operates with partially premixed, swirl-stabilized flames and can be operated in single- and different multiple-burner setups. The design parameters of the combustor prevent large-scale flame-flame interactions in the multiple-burner arrangements. The objective is to investigate how the interaction of the swirl jets affects the thermoacoustic stability of the combustor. Results of measurements of pressure oscillations and high-speed OH∗-chemiluminescence imaging for the single-burner setup and two multiple-burner setups are discussed. Additionally, results of investigations with different flame characteristics are presented. These are achieved by varying the ratio of the mass flow rates through the swirlers of the double-concentric swirl nozzle. Several unstable modes with high pressure amplitudes are observed in the single-burner setup as well as in the multiple-burner setups. Numerical studies of the acoustic behavior of the combustor setups were performed that indicate that the different geometries show similar acoustic behaviors. The results lead to the conclusion that the interaction of the swirl jets in the multiple-burner setups affects the thermoacoustic response spectrum of the flame even in the absence of large-scale flame-flame interactions. Based on the findings in earlier studies, it is concluded that the differences in the flame response characteristics are induced by the reduction of the swirl intensity in the multiple-burner arrangements, which is caused by the exchange of momentum between the adjacent swirl jets. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Shatter cones are the only distinct meso- to macroscopic recognition criterion for impact structures, yet not all is known about their formation. The Keurusselkä impact structure, Finland, is interesting in that it presents a multitude of well-exposed shatter cones in medium- to coarse-grained granitoids. The allegedly 27 km wide Keurusselkä impact structure was formed about 1150 Ma ago in rocks of the Central Finland Granitoid Complex. Special attention was paid in this work to possible relationships between shatter cones and local, as well as regionally occurring, fracture or joint systems. A possible shatter cone find outside the previously suggested edge of the structure could mean that the Keurusselkä impact structure is larger than previously thought. The spacing between joints/fractures from regional joint systems was influenced by the impact, but impact-induced fractures strongly follow the regional joint orientation trends. There is a distinct relationship between shatter cones and joints: shatter cones occur on and against joint surfaces of varied orientations and belonging to the regional orientation trends. Planar fractures (PF) and planar deformation features (PDF) were found in three shatter cone samples from the central-most part of the impact structure, whereas other country rock samples from the same level of exposure but further from the assumed center lack shock deformation features. PDF occurrence is enhanced within 5 mm of shatter cone surfaces, which is interpreted to suggest that shock wave reverberation at preimpact joints could be responsible for this local enhancement of shock deformation. Some shatter cone surfaces are coated with a quasi-opaque material which is also found in conspicuous veinlets that branch off from shatter cone surfaces and resemble pseudotachylitic breccia veins. The vein-filling is composed of two mineral phases, one of which could be identified as a montmorillonitic phyllosilicate. The second phase could not be identified yet. The original composition of the fill could not be determined. Further work is required on this material. Observed joints and fractures were discussed against findings from Barringer impact crater. They show that impact-induced joints in the basement rock do not follow impact-specific orientations (such as radial, conical, or concentric). © The Meteoritical Society, 2016.

AB  - Dual-concentric core photonic crystal fibers (DCC-PCF) were a kind of dispersion compensating fiber with ultrahigh negative dispersion. However, they usually have an undesirable characteristic, called 'modal squeeze' in this letter, which causes difficulty in achieving a single-mode operation. This letter discusses a phenomenon of modal squeeze, and proposes a solution to avoid it. Finally, we give designing examples of DCC-PCFs for avoiding the modal squeeze and operating in single mode. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Existing steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings subjected to seismic hazards can exhibit an undesirable soft-story response, in which drift and damage are concentrated in a single story, whereas other stories remain relatively undamaged. This paper investigates the fundamental behavior and proposes a rehabilitative design procedure that uses a stiff rocking core (SRC) to redistribute lateral demands, thereby preventing soft-story response. The technique is relatively nonintrusive compared to traditional rehabilitative measures and can satisfy a maximum specified story drift for a given hazard level. Representative low-rise and midrise prototype CBFs are used to illustrate the fundamental mechanical and dynamic behavior of the SRC in support of the proposed rehabilitation design procedure. Results from nonlinear transient seismic analysis of both existing and SRC-rehabilitated CBFs are used to evaluate the SRC's ability to improve the seismic performance of existing CBF structures. These results indicate that the SRC can be designed to prevent soft-story formation and, at the same time, achieve a target maximum interstory drift for a given seismic hazard. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Steel concentrically-braced frames (CBFs) as seismic lateral force resisting systems have been widely used in seismic regions. The incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is adopted to construct the collapse ductility spectrum for the CBF considering the P-Δ effect and sudden loss in strength and stiffness, which is physically more meaningful than existing baseline criteria. The design performance plot is constructed by newly combining the collapse ductility spectrum with ductility demand spectrum on the same figure, from which the threshold period and design ductility region for the frame are determined. A parametric study is conducted for the CBF over the full range of periods and parameters. The results show that the reserve capacity of the CBF contributes appreciably to collapse prevention, and the presented approach is more suitable for assessing the collapse of CBFs with dynamic instability. For moderate seismic regions, the threshold periods of the CBF determined by both the collapse ductility spectrum and existing baseline criteria are quite close. However, for high seismic regions, using the global drift angle limit may yield non-conservative results, since it fails to address the dynamic instability of CBFs with short periods. © 2017, Hong Kong Institute of Steel Construction.

AB  - Context: Neuromuscular alterations are a major causal factor of primary and secondary injuries. Though injury prevention programs have experienced some success, rates of injuries have not declined, and after injury, individuals often return to activity with functionality below clinical recommendations. Considering alternative therapies to the conventional concentric exercise approach, such as one that can target neuromuscular injury risk and postinjury alterations, may provide for more effective injury prevention and rehabilitation protocols. Evidence Acquisition: Peer-reviewed sources available on the Web of Science and MEDLINE databases from 2000 through 2016 were gathered using searches associated with the keywords eccentric exercise, injury prevention, and neuromuscular control. Hypothesis: Eccentric exercise will reduce injury risk by targeting specific neural and morphologic alterations that precipitate neuromuscular dysfunction. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Results: Neuromuscular control is influenced by alterations in muscle morphology and neural activity. Eccentric exercise beneficially modifies several underlying factors of muscle morphology (fiber typing, cross-sectional area, working range, and pennation angle), and emerging evidence indicates that eccentric exercise is also beneficial to peripheral and central neural activity (alpha motorneuron recruitment/firing, sarcolemma activity, corticospinal excitability, and brain activation). Conclusion: There is mounting evidence that eccentric exercise is not only a therapeutic intervention influencing muscle morphology but also targets unique alterations in neuromuscular control, influencing injury risk. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper analyzes the patterns of the formation of the aquatic and semiaquatic bird species population under the conditions of the altitudinal zonality of the Putorana Plateau. The population density and abundance of a number of background species was ascertained to decrease from the subalpine belt towards the forest and alpine belt. The bird population density in all the considered aquatic and semiaquatic habitats was revealed to change in a rather narrow range of values: the maximal population density indicator in aquatic and semiaquatic habitats is only 1.9 times higher than the minimal indicator. In the mountainous Subarctic region with a radial macrosymmetry, the spatial dynamics of abundance has a concentrically centrifugal nature in many aquatic and semiaquatic bird species. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - An experiment has been performed to study the effect of system integration by two different concentrator assisted de-salting systems. The compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) and compound conical concentrator (CCC) are used in this research work. Two solar desalination systems, the single slope solar still (SSSS), and pyramid solar still (PSS), have been integrated with a CCC and compound parabolic concentrator-concentric circular tubular solar still (CPC-CCTSS). To study the effect of system integration, a thick cloth prevents the entry of sunlight into the solar still top. Additionally the concentrator assisted de-salting systems are equipped with phase change material (PCM) for enhancement. In CCC-SSSS, the PCM fills the inside of hollow copper balls and the balls are placed in the SSSS basin. In the CPC-CCTSS, the PCM is loaded in the specially designed circular trough. Two methodologies are followed here to produce the fresh water even while the distillers are blocked from the sunlight. They are (1) thermosyphon effect in CCC-SSSS and (2) waste heat recovery from CPC-CCTSS. The results showed that the productivity of CCC-SSSS, CCC-SSSS with PCM, and CCC-SSSS (PCM) top cover shaded were found as 2680 mL/m2/d, 3240 mL/m2/d and 1646 mL/ m2/d, respectively. Similarly the productivity of the CPC-CCTSS-PSS, CPC-CCTSS (PCM)-PSS and CPC-CCTSS (PCM)-PSS top cover shaded were found as 7160 mL/m2/d, 7346 mL/m2/d, and 5120 mL/m2/d. The productivity of the CCC-SSSS and CPC-CCTSS-PSS is examined and conclusions are drawn such as the solar radiation blocked distillers productivity did not drop to zero. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

AB  - The purpose of study was to identify the presence of strength asymmetries (SA) in young elite soccer players in relation to muscle group (knee extensors (KE) and flexors (KF)) and limb preference (dominant vs. non-dominant limb). Forty-one U16 national team soccer players (mean age 15.7±0.3 years, body height 177.9±6.6 cm, body weight 68.2±7.9 kg) participated in this study. Assessments were performed on a Cybex Humac Norm isokinetic dynamometer in concentric contraction. We noted the degree of SAs in the bilateral ratio of quadriceps and hamstrings and in the ipsilateral ratio of the dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NL) legs. Bilateral deficits of KFs were higher (9.02–12.61 %) than those of KFs (6.32–7.15 %). The percentage of SA (>10 %) in knee extensors was 19.5– 31.7 %. The percentage of SA (>10 %) in knee flexors was 36.6–51.2 %. At the lowest velocity, there was a significantly higher prevalence of SAs in KFs than in KEs (χ2= 4.11, p<.05). The ipsilateral ratio was lowest at the lowest velocity regardless of limb dominance (DL: 58.95–63.27 %, NL: 56.58–60.11 %). At each velocity, the percentage of SA was higher for the non-dominant limb (12.2–24.4 %) than for the dominant one (4.9–14.6 %). Despite these differences, we did not find any significantly higher prevalence of SA in the nondominant limb than in the dominant one (χ2=.35–2.04, p>.05). The results of the study suggest that more than 73.2 % of players have at least one SA. More attention should be paid to knee flexors, where a higher percentage of strength asymmetries were observed; furthermore, a higher percentage of strength asymmetry was seen in the non-dominant lower limb. © 2016, Universidad de la Frontera.

AB  - A compact multi-wire-layered (MWL) secondary winding for a Tesla transformer is put forward. The basic principle of this winding is to wind the metal wire on a polymeric base tube in a multi-layer manner. The tube is tapered and has high electrical strength and high mechanical strength. Concentric-circle grooves perpendicular to the axis of the tube are carved on the surface of the tube to wind the wire. The width of the groove is basically equal to the diameter of the wire so that the metal wire can be fixed in the groove without glue. The depth of the groove is n times of the diameter of the wire to realize the n-layer winding manner. All the concentric-circle grooves are connected via a spiral groove on the surface of the tube to let the wire go through. Compared with the traditional one-wire-layered (OWL) secondary winding for the Tesla transformer, the most conspicuous advantage of the MWL secondary winding is that the latter is compact with only a length of 2/n of the OWL. In addition, the MWL winding has the following advantages: high electrical strength since voids are precluded from the surface of the winding, high mechanical strength because polymer is used as the material of the base tube, and reliable fixation in the Tesla transformer as special mechanical connections are designed. A 2000-turn MWL secondary winding is fabricated with a winding layer of 3 and a total length of 1.0 m. Experiments to test the performance of this winding on a Tesla-type pulse generator are conducted. The results show that this winding can boost the voltage to 1 MV at a repetition rate of 50 Hz reliably for a lifetime longer than 104 pulses, which proves the feasibility of the MWL secondary winding. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - A novel, compact, multiple band notch filter (MBNF) is presented. Contiguous and concentric split ring resonators (SRRs) and ring resonator are used to achieve desired multiple narrow band notches. These band notches have been designed to avoid the undesired interference between co-existing wireless channels. Proposed filter is implemented on RT/Duroid 5880 (ϵr=2.2) substrate of thickness 0.785 mm and surface area of 14 × 14 sq. mm. Insertion loss of the proposed filter at notch bands is high (>13 dB) and low (<0.8 dB) elsewhere. Measured results are correlated with simulated results and ensure proposed filter is a suitable candidate to mitigate interference caused by the co-existing and emerging wireless technologies. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Abstract: A ‘spatial turn’ is observed as taking place across a range of disciplines. This article discusses the relevance of this ‘spatial turn’ to the issue of early school leaving prevention and engagement of marginalised students and their parents within the educational system and other support services. Building on reconceptualisation of an aspect of structural anthropology a specific dynamic spatial interaction between diametric and concentric structures of relation is proposed. Reification is interpreted as involving a diametric space of assumed separation, closure and mirror image inversions. Concentric relational space as assumed connection and relative openness is a precondition for trust, care and voice. Diametric and concentric spatial features of school and related systems are interrogated for early school leaving issues, such as the importance of relational supports to keep students in the system; the precondition of trust for parental involvement of more marginalised parents, including a lifelong learning and family support aspect; the need to challenge the school as a closed system with reified hierarchies. © 2015 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.

AB  - Most common preventive eccentric-based exercises, such as Nordic hamstring do not include any hip flexion. So, the elongation stress reached is lower than during the late swing phase of sprinting. The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of hamstring architectural (fascicle length and pennation angle) and functional (concentric and eccentric optimum angles and concentric and eccentric peak torques) parameters following a 3-week eccentric resistance program performed at long (LML) vs. short muscle length (SML). Both groups performed eight sessions of 3-5 × 8 slow maximal eccentric knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer: the SML group at 0° and the LML group at 80° of hip flexion. Architectural parameters were measured using ultrasound imaging and functional parameters using the isokinetic dynamometer. The fascicle length increased by 4.9% (p < 0.01, medium effect size) in the SML and by 9.3% (p < 0.001, large effect size) in the LML group. The pennation angle did not change (p = 0.83) in the SML and tended to decrease by 0.7° (p = 0.09, small effect size) in the LML group. The concentric optimum angle tended to decrease by 8.8° (p = 0.09, medium effect size) in the SML and by 17.3° (p < 0.01, large effect size) in the LML group. The eccentric optimum angle did not change (p = 0.19, small effect size) in the SML and tended to decrease by 10.7° (p = 0.06, medium effect size) in the LML group. The concentric peak torque did not change in the SML (p = 0.37) and the LML (p = 0.23) groups, whereas eccentric peak torque increased by 12.9% (p < 0.01, small effect size) and 17.9% (p < 0.001, small effect size) in the SML and the LML group, respectively. No group-by-time interaction was found for any parameters. A correlation was found between the training-induced change in fascicle length and the change in concentric optimum angle (r = -0.57, p < 0.01). These results suggest that performing eccentric exercises lead to several architectural and functional adaptations. However, further investigations are required to confirm the hypothesis that performing eccentric exercises at LML may lead to greater adaptations than a similar training performed at SML. © 2016 Guex, Degache, Morisod, Sailly and Millet.

AB  - In this study, we explore the lowerature thresholds of a pest of apple (Malus pumila Miller; Rosaceae), the eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana Denis and Schiffermüller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in the context of spring frost. Spilonota ocellana overwinters as a larva, resuming activity and feeding early in the growing season when it could be vulnerable to unexpected freezing temperatures. We determined that the mean supercooling point of spring instars did not differ for larvae within or outside leaf shelters and ranged from -9.1±0.2 °C for fourth instars, to -7.9±0.2 °C for sixth instars. Larval weight increased with instar and was positively related to the supercooling point. As some insects are freeze tolerant and able to recover from freezing, we also exposed larvae to brief freeze events between -4.5 °C and -9.5 °C and found that the median lower lethal temperature, was -7.3±0.4 °C across all instars; indicating that S. ocellana spring instars are susceptible to freezing temperatures above their supercooling point. These lowerature thresholds suggest that in the spring, S. ocellana larvae are chill susceptible, and a hard frost (<-7 °C) would be necessary to cause significant larval mortality. © Entomological Society of Canada 2017.

AB  - A global quench is an interesting setting where we can study thermalization of subsystems in a pure state. We investigate entanglement entropy (EE) growth in global quenches in holographic field theories and relate some of its aspects to quantities characterizing chaos. More specifically we obtain four key results:1.We prove holographic bounds on the entanglement velocity vE and the butterfly effect speed vB that arises in the study of chaos.2.We obtain the EE as a function of time for large spherical entangling surfaces analytically. We show that the EE is insensitive to the details of the initial state or quench protocol.3.In a thermofield double state we determine analytically the two-sided mutual information between two large concentric spheres separated in time.4.We derive a bound on the rate of growth of EE for arbitrary shapes, and develop an expansion for EE at early times. In a companion paper [1], these results are put in the broader context of EE growth in chaotic systems: we relate EE growth to the chaotic spreading of operators, derive bounds on EE at a given time, and compare the holographic results to spin chain numerics and toy models. In this paper, we perform holographic calculations that provide the basis of arguments presented in that paper. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Shinmoedake volcano started a sub-plinian eruption after an interval of 300 years, since its latest magmatic eruption in 1716-1717. In 2003, the committee for volcanic disaster prevention consisting of local governments has been established. The committee published the Kirishima volcano disaster prevention handbook in March, 2008. Soon after, a series of precursory events of the 2011 eruption began. The media reported that pyroclastic flows were generated in all directions, but, actually, only one small pyroclastic flow occurred. Also an oblique eruption deposit was recognized on the upper slope of the volcano consisting of pumice-fall deposit showing slightly elliptic to concentric wrinkle pattern. The information provided by researchers were sometimes inaccurate and generated unnecessary concerns among the public. The main reasons for these are: 1) the disaster prevention map was not easy to understand, 2) the sense of impending crisis was unnecessarily increased by the announcements of a potential for sector collapse of the volcanic edifice, and 3) the eruptive history of the volcano was not reasonably understood among researchers, hence, it took a few days before researchers recognized that this is actually "an apparent magmatic eruption after 300 years interval". These issues are some of the challenges that the research community should consider during future eruptions. © 2017 Chikei Dojo Saigai Kenkyo Bumon. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of foundation uplift on the dynamic response of steel frames supported by shallow foundations. In order to achieve this goal, the dynamic responses of a number of two-dimensional concentrically braced steel frames with fixed base, flexible base preventing uplift, and flexible base allowing uplift, are compared. The steel frames are modeled by considering material nonlinearities and P-Delta effects, while the soil-foundation system is modeled through the Winkler foundation approach. The dynamic analyses are conducted using 15 far-fault ground-motions with various intensities and different response parameters are monitored. According to the achieved responses, the presence of foundation uplift generally increases the total displacement demands and reduces the inter-story drift ratio and ductility demands. The important parameters affecting the responses of uplift-permitted frames are also introduced and examined. © ASCE.

AB  - Plants release volatiles in response to caterpillar feeding that attract natural enemies of the herbivores, a tri-trophic interaction which has been considered an indirect plant defence against herbivores. The caterpillar-induced plant volatiles have been reported to repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores. To date however, no volatile signals that either repel or attract conspecific adults under field conditions have been chemically identified. Apple seedlings uniquely released seven compounds including acetic acid, acetic anhydride, benzyl alcohol, benzyl nitrile, indole, 2-phenylethanol, and (E)-nerolidol only when infested by larvae of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana. In field tests in New Zealand, a blend of two of these, benzyl nitrile and acetic acid, attracted a large number of conspecific male and female adult moths. In North America, male and female adults of the tortricid, oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, were most attracted to a blend of 2-phenylethanol and acetic acid. Both sexes of the eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana, were highly attracted to a blend of benzyl nitrile and acetic acid. This study provides the first identification of caterpillar-induced plant volatiles that attract conspecific adult herbivores under natural conditions, challenging the expectation of herbivore avoidance of these induced volatiles.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the force outputs achieved during a squat exercise using a rotational inertia device in stable versus unstable conditions with different loads and in concentric and eccentric phases. Thirteen male athletes (mean ± SD: age 23.7 ± 3.0 years, height 1.80 ± 0.08 m, body mass 77.4 ± 7.9 kg) were assessed while squatting, performing one set of three repetitions with four different loads under stable and unstable conditions at maximum concentric effort. Overall, there were no significant differences between the stable and unstable conditions at each of the loads for any of the dependent variables. Mean force showed significant differences between some of the loads in stable and unstable conditions (P < 0.010) and peak force output differed between all loads for each condition (P < 0.045). Mean force outputs were greater in the concentric than in the eccentric phase under both conditions and with all loads (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in peak force between concentric and eccentric phases at any load in either stable or unstable conditions. In conclusion, squatting with a rotational inertia device allowed the generation of similar force outputs under stable and unstable conditions at each of the four loads. The study also provides empirical evidence of the different force outputs achieved by adjusting load conditions on the rotational inertia device when performing squats, especially in the case of peak force. Concentric force outputs were significantly higher than eccentric outputs, except for peak force under both conditions. These findings support the use of the rotational inertia device to train the squatting exercise under unstable conditions for strength and conditioning trainers. The device could also be included in injury prevention programs for muscle lesions and ankle and knee joint injuries. © 2016 Vázquez-Guerrero et al.

AB  - The authors address the problem of depth map upsampling using a corresponding high-resolution color image. The depth map is captured by low-resolution time-of-flight cameras paired with a high-resolution RGB camera. Inspired by guided image filtering, the proposed method not only uses the structure of the high-resolution color image as guidance, it also exploits local gradient information of depth images to suppress potential texture-copying artifacts. In addition, the authors introduce onion-peel-order filtering that predicts depth values from outside inward in a concentric-layer order, which avoids depth bleeding during the propagation process. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this approach over prior depth map upsampling methods. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Although many previous studies have shown that eye-like images promote generosity, the mechanism of this “watching eyes effect” remains unclear. One possible cause is the concern for a good reputation as a generous person, while the other is the concerns for a bad reputation as a norm violator. To elucidate which of these two concerns is the main influencer, the present study conducted a laboratory experiment that investigated whether the watching eyes effect changed depending on social norms. If the concern for a good reputation leads to the effect, prosocial behavior would be more likely in the presence of watching eyes, regardless of the social norms involved. However, if the concern for avoiding a bad reputation as a norm violator leads to the effect, watching eyes promote prosocial behavior only in the existence of prosocial norms. In the original study, participants were asked to make a charitable donation under conditions in which eye-like images either were or were not present. In addition to the eye-like images, we manipulated prosocial norms by informing each participant of either high or low mean donation amounts given by previous participants. We found that watching eyes promoted donations only when a prosocial norm existed. This supports the idea that the watching eyes effect is caused by a concern for avoiding a bad reputation from violating norms. However, in a replication study, we were unable to replicate the original results; watching eyes did not promote generosity regardless of the norm. Taken together, we discussed the moderation effect of norms and the possibility of other moderators. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We investigated the influence of shortening speed on concentric force potentiation at different frequencies in muscles devoid of skeletal myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK−/−) and unable to phosphorylate myosin. EDL muscles from skMLCK−/− mice were activated in vitro (25 °C) across a range of stimulation frequencies (10–100 Hz) during shortening ramps at 0.10, 0.30, or 0.50 of maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) before and after a potentiating stimulus (PS). When collapsed across all frequencies, the PS increased relative (post/pre) concentric force to 1.27 ± 0.02 and 1.17 ± 0.02 of pre-PS values at 0.50 and 0.30 Vmax, respectively (n = 4, P < 0.05 for all speeds). In addition, potentiation was significantly greater at low and intermediate—than at high stimulus frequencies at both speeds. In contrast, during shortening at 0.10 Vmax, a posttetanic depression was observed as mean concentric forces were reduced to 0.85 ± 0.02 of pre-PS values. Thus, although reduced compared to published values for wildtype muscles (Gittings et al., J Muscle Res Cell Motil 33:359–368, 2012), skMLCK−/− muscles displayed a speed dependent potentiation of concentric force during moderate and fast shortening speed at all frequencies tested. Our data support the presence of a myosin phosphorylation—independent mechanism(s) for concentric force potentiation at moderate speeds of shortening, and also suggests that myosin phosphorylation may be necessary to prevent the concentric force depression that may be present at slow speeds of shortening. Although additive in nature, further work is needed to parse out the relative influence of myosin phosphorylation—independent and dependent potentiation mechanisms on wildtype contractile function during dynamic conditions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - In this work, a modified Leslie–Gower-type predator–prey model is analyzed, considering now that the prey population is affected by a weak Allee effect, complementing results obtained in previous papers in which the consequences of strong Allee effect for the same model were established. In order to simplify the calculations, a diffeomorphism is constructed to obtain a topological equivalent system for which we establish the boundedness of solutions, the nature of equilibrium points, the existence of a separatrix curve dividing the behavior of trajectories. Also, the existence of two concentric limit cycles surrounding a unique positive equilibrium point (generalized Hopf or Bautin bifurcation) is shown. Although the equilibrium point associated to the weak Allee effect lies in the second quadrant, the model has a rich dynamics due to this phenomenon, such as it happens when a strong Allee effect is considered in prey population. The model here analyzed has some similar behaviors with the model considering strong Allee effect, having both two limit cycles; nevertheless, they differ in the amount of positive equilibrium points and the existence in our model of a non-infinitesimal limit cycle, which exists when the positive equilibrium is a repeller node. The main results obtained are reinforced by means of some numerical simulations. © Vilnius University, 2017.

AB  - Due to the low efficiency of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) raw data generation in distributed scene, a high-efficient SAR echo simulation method based on the modified concentric circles algorithm and the graphics processing unit (GPU) is proposed. Firstly, an improved concentric circles algorithm is proposed to avoid cases of low signal to noise ratio (SNR) when the traditional algorithm whose precision is low is used. Secondly, the parallel processing of GPU is deeply optimized in order to lift the efficiency of the simulation and make full use of the parallel advantages in GPU kernel. Then, the proposed method adopts “thread extrapolation” to accumulate partial data and realize the whole data generation via “reduction adding”. Finally, simulation results validate the high precision and eficiency of the proposed approach. © 2016, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics. All right reserved.

The emphasis is primarily put on the nature and development of the weak storey behaviour in order to designate the effects that shall be taken into account in an effective design procedure. In a second stage, the focus is on developing supplementary conditions to Eurocode 8 based on plastic analysis that can enhance the designs by preventing the occurrence of weak storeys. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many species of phytoplankton, simple photoreceptors monitor ambient lighting. Photoreceptors provide a number of selective advantages including the ability to assess the time of day for circadian rhythms, seasonal changes, and the detection of excessive light intensities and harmful UV light. Photoreceptors also serve as depth gauges in the water column for behaviors such as diurnal vertical migration. Photoreceptors can be organized together with screening pigment into visible eyespots. In a wide variety of motile phytoplankton, including Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Euglena, and Kryptoperidinium, eyespots are light-sensitive organelles residing within the cell. Eyespots are composed of photoreceptor proteins and typically red to orange carotenoid screening pigments. This association of photosensory pigment with screening pigment allows for detection of light directionality, needed for light-guided behaviors such as positive and negative phototaxis. In Chlamydomonas, the eyespot is located in the chloroplast and Chlamydomonas expresses a number of photosensory pigments including the microbial channelrhodopsins (ChR1 and ChR2). Dinoflagellates are unicellular protists that are ecologically important constituents of the phytoplankton. They display a great deal of diversity in morphology, nutritional modes and symbioses, and can be photosynthetic or heterotrophic, feeding on smaller phytoplankton. Dinoflagellates, such as Kryptoperidinium foliaceum, have eyespots that are used for light-mediated tasks including phototaxis. Dinoflagellates belonging to the family Warnowiaceae have a more elaborate eye. Their eye-organelle, called an ocelloid, is a large, elaborate structure consisting of a focusing lens, highly ordered retinal membranes, and a shield of dark pigment. This complex eye-organelle is similar to multicellular camera eyes, such as our own. Unraveling the molecular makeup, structure and function of dinoflagellate eyes, as well as light-guided behaviors in phytoplankton can inform us about the selective forces that drove evolution in the important steps from light detection to vision. We show here that the evolution from simple photoreception to vision seems to have independently followed identical paths and principles in phytoplankton and animals, significantly strengthening our understanding of this important biological process. © 2016 The Author 2016.

AB  - Context: Sport-specific adaptations at the glenohumeral joint could occur in adolescent athletes because they start participating in high-performance sports in early childhood. Objective: To investigate shoulder-rotator strength, internalrotation (IR) and external-rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM), and acromiohumeral distance (AHD) in asymptomatic adolescent volleyball attackers to determine if they have risk factors for injury. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Thirty-nine adolescent high school-aged volleyball attackers (22 boys, 17 girls; age = 16.0 ± 1.4 years, height = 179.2 ± 9.0 cm, mass = 67.1 ± 10.9 kg, body mass index = 20.7 ± 2.6 kg/m2). Main Outcome Measure(s): Shoulder IR and ER ROM, total-rotation ROM, glenohumeral IR deficit, AHD, and concentric and eccentric strength of the shoulder internal and external rotators were tested bilaterally. Results: External-rotation ROM was greater (t38=4.92, P < .001), but IR ROM (t38 =-8.61, P < .001) and total ROM (t38 = -3.55, P = .01) were less in the dominant shoulder, and 15 athletes had a glenohumeral IR deficit (IR ROM loss . 188). We observed greater concentric internal-rotator (t38=2.89, P=.006) and eccentric external-rotator (t38=2.65, P=.01) strength in the dominant than in the nondominant shoulder. The AHD was less in the dominant shoulder (t38 =-3.60, P < .001). Conclusions: Adolescent volleyball attackers demonstrated decreased IR ROM, total ROM, and AHD and increased ER ROM in their dominant shoulder. Therefore, routine screening of adolescent athletes and designing training programs for hazardous adaptive changes could be important in preventing shoulder injuries. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

AB  - Over 150 million years, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved. Predatory birds and mammals have eyes on the front of their heads. In these animals, binocular correspondence, voluntary eye movements, eye-hand coordination, partial decussation at the optic chiasm and cortical interhemispheric pathways could develop at the cost of a smaller visual field. The subsequent enlargement of the cerebral neocortex and the hemispheric pathways are of central importance in binocular vision, sensory fusion and infantile strabismus. To investigate visual interhemispheric fibers, tractography was used in subjects with infantile esotropia (IE), callosal agenesis and control subjects with normal binocularity. In human callosal agenesis, normal binocularity could be explained by a different interhemispheric connection. In subjects with infantile esotropia, the analyses starting from the primary visual area on one side appeared different from the analysis from the other side. The distribution areas are asymmetrical between sides. Binocularity and alignment not only rely on correspondence between crossed and uncrossed hemi-representations but, in addition the corpus callosum, the most important interhemispheric pathway in placental mammals, seems important in the development of human binocularity. When correspondence is possible between the hemi-representations of the crossed and the uncrossed pathway on both sides of the cortex, the uncrossed pathway finds its way via the corpus callosum toward the contralateral hemi-representation of the same eye. A vertical midline must come out of this process. Meanwhile, however, the other uncrossed pathway strives to find the vertical midline of the other eye. Likely, the corpus callosum is important during the tuning of the pathways involved in sensory fusion. The anterior commissure might be an alternative in callosal agenesis. A failure in the offset will result in strabismus and crossed dominance after V1. Consequently, the normal binocular development of the brainstem (i.e., the superior colliculus), will not take place and latent nystagmus, as well as dissociated divergence, may ensue. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - This paper presents two analysis methods for the in-plane seismic response of steel multitiered braced frames (MT-BFs) with three or more tiers: (1) a substructuring technique; and (2) a stiffness analysis method. Both methods are consistent with the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions and have been developed to estimate column flexural demands and tier drifts to prevent column instability and to mitigate concentration of tier drifts as well as premature brace failure under seismic loading. Both methods account for the progression of brace tension yielding along the frame height as observed in MT-BFs. The substructuring technique is simpler and is limited to regular frames, as it assumes a predefined yielding sequence. The stiffness analysis-based method is more rigorous and can predict the actual frame nonlinear response. It can be applied to both regular and irregular MT-BF configurations. The application of the methods is illustrated for two five-tiered special concentrically braced frame examples. Nonlinear response history analysis is performed to validate the proposed methods for the frames studied. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Male investment towards reproduction is substantial in some species, and this leads to the evolution of choosy males. Male choice is often directed towards female phenotypes that are good indicators of fecundity such as body size, age, or virgin status, and often acts in the same direction as fecundity selection. In insects, only a few examples exist where male choice is directed towards female ornaments as proxies Butler of female quality. Here, we use dry season males of the sex-role reversed butterfly species Bicyclus anynana to test for differences in male choosiness and investment towards females of varying attractiveness using ornamentmanipulations. Male reproductive investment in this species is in the form of a nuptial gift, a spermatophore, given to females upon mating. Males were placed in cages with either wild-type ornamented females or with nonornamented females (center of the dorsal forewing eyespots painted over), and time to mating, duration of mating, and longevity of males and females after a single mating were measured. Ornament manipulations consisted of blocking the UV-reflective scales in the center of the dorsal forewing eyespots of females, a known sexual ornament. Males displayed lower latency to mate and longer mating durations with ornamented females. The longer mating duration did not, however, translate in the transfer of a nuptial gift that increased female longevity or reduced male longevity. Instead, we propose that longer mating durations with ornamented females may represent increased mate guarding behavior or increased sperm transfer. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - A new genus and species of a large ghost moth (Lepidoptera, Exoporia, Hepialidae) is described from south-central Peru based on a single pair of adults, male and female. Viridigigas ciseskii, new genus, new species, is recorded from two locations along the eastern versant of the Amazonian Andes. Its phylogenetic position within the Hepialidae is currently inconclusive with some features suggestive of affinity with two other genera, Puermytrans Viette, 1951 (Chile), and Phassodes Bethune-Baker, 1905 (Fiji). The forewing pattern is distinct from all other Hepialidae, consisting of green with numerous sub-circular dark brown to yellowish-brown spots of irregular shape enclosed by up to three concentric dark brown lines. In the male a prominent scent gland is present at the base of the fore wing and the metatibia support well-developed, elongate androconia.

AB  - A seismic design strategy, which is intended to be implemented within the framework of the U.S. seismic design provisions for steel structures, is presented for single-story steel concentrically braced frames that are divided into two tiers. In this method, the columns are designed to resist the axial loads acting in combination with the in-plane flexural demand resulting from uneven distribution of brace inelastic deformations over the frame height. This design procedure, which establishes enhanced requirements beyond the 2010 edition of the U.S. seismic design provisions, prevents concentration of deformation in one tier and causes frame nonlinear deformation to be distributed between the tiers. The column bending moments depend on the story shear resistance that develops in each tier when the bracing members are at buckling and in the postbuckling range. The method also aims to control tier drifts to protect the bracing members from excessive inelastic demand, which could cause brace fracture. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are performed to validate the proposed design procedure. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper proposed a image fog removal method. The method based on the disinhibition properties of retinal neurons concentric receptive field whose function is three Gaussians. Firstly, we enhance original fog image by using contrast limited global histogram equalization. Secondly, a local image enhancement method is carried out to restore the image's details and deepness information. According to comparison experiment, the results of this paper's method were compared with the results of dark channel prior based method and the results of CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). The experimental results proved that the method of contrast limited global histogram equalization was able to avoid enhancing too light and to avoid adding noising. In addition, local details enhancement by three Gaussians strengthened the image's depth information. The method of this paper worked well in images fog removing and enhanced fog images' visibility. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - In recent earthquakes in Chile, New Zealand, and Japan modern buildings were generally quite safe. However, there was a tremendous variability in the economic and social consequences associated with damage repair and loss of occupancy. Code-compliant structures are generally designed to provide safety and prevent collapse at minimum costs, but when severe ground shaking occurs, the damage to contents, nonstructural components and the structural system can result in loss of function, which can have a dramatic impact on the occupants, owners, and community. Such situations can be avoided by mitigating future seismic damage through a better structural design. Although structural enhancements may likely increase the initial cost of a structure they should be compensated through benefits realized over its lifetime. This paper presents the results of repair cost and repair time analyses of conventional and high-performance code-compliant low-rise commercial steel buildings designed for the same location. The buildings are located at a site with high seismic hazard representative of western North America. The conventional lateral load-resisting systems include: special moment resisting frame, special concentrically braced frame, and buckling restrained braced frame; and high-performance systems include: seismically isolated intermediate moment resisting frame, seismically isolated ordinary concentrically braced frame, seismically isolated buckling restrained braced frame, and viscously damped moment frame. In addition, enhancements of the fixed, seismically isolated, and viscously damped moment frames beyond the code minimum and their effect on the repair cost and repair time are studied. The analysis reveals significant damage savings for code-compliant seismically isolated systems relative to their conventional counterpart, with seismically isolated ordinary concentrically braced frames yielding the largest savings. It also shows that enhancements of the isolation and viscously damped system beyond code minimum standards results in significant reduction in damage-induced losses, while the enhancement of the SMRF does not yield desirable loss reduction. © 2017 WIT Press.

AB  - Infrared (IR) transmissive moth eye-like substrates, including randomly patterned fused silica and various periodically patterned germanium substrates, were surface modified using a simple process. Goniometric analysis showed that the surface modification altered the surface wettability of each substrate, rendering them superhydrophobic. Following the surface modification, it was determined that the desirable IR transmission and antireflective properties of each substrate type were maintained. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity, IR transmission and antireflective capabilities of the substrates were shown to be significantly enhanced in comparison to native, non-patterned fused silica and germanium substrates that underwent the same processes. The results of this work provide an opportunity for the development of enhanced utility for infrared transmissive optics in wet or humid conditions. © 2017 SPIE.

AB  - The micro-crustacean Daphnia pulex is a model species for studying predator-induced defenses. When exposed to chemical cues released by its predator, the phantom midge larvae Chaoborus (Diptera), it develops protective neckteeth that reduce the predator’s success of predation in the juvenile instars. Defensive traits need to be expressed as soon as possible, which requires an early sensitivity to predator cues. We investigated the exact kairomone-sensitive period in three D. pulex strains and the timeline of neckteeth expression in early juvenile instars. We divided embryonic development into five major stages based on successive morphological landmarks. We exposed animals in these developmental stages to kairomones in order to determine the sensitive periods for neckteeth expression in the 1st and 2nd juvenile instar. Our results indicate that kairomone sensitivity starts during embryogenesis when compound eye spots begin to fuse and egg membranes are shed. Neckteeth develop with a stage-dependent time lag, being shorter when exposed in the first kairomone-sensitive stage and longer when exposed in the following developmental stages. Evolution of early kairomone sensitivity and fast defense development is a crucial step in D. pulex’s defenses against Chaoborus as it allows for protection of the most vulnerable juvenile stages. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Hamstring injuries are common in sprinters and mainly occur during the terminal swing phase. Eccentric training has been shown to reduce hamstring injury rate by improving several risk factors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an additional swing phase-specific hamstring eccentric training in well-Trained sprinters performed at the commencement of the winter preparation is more efficient to improve strength, ratio, optimum angle, and flexibility than a similar program without hamstring eccentric exercises. Twenty sprinters were randomly allocated to an eccentric (n 10) or a control group (n 10). Both groups performed their usual track and field training throughout the study period. Sprinters in the eccentric group performed an additional 6-week hamstring eccentric program, which was specific to the swing phase of the running cycle (eccentric high-load open-chain kinetic movements covering the whole hamstring length-Tension relationship preformed at slow to moderate velocity). Isokinetic and flexibility measurements were performed before and after the intervention. The eccentric group increased hamstring peak torques in concentric at 60°·s-1 by 16% (p < 0.001) and at 240°·s-1 by 10% (p < 0.01), in eccentric at 30°·s-1 by 20% (p < 0.001) and at 120°·s-1 by 22% (p < 0.001), conventional and functional ratios by 12% (p < 0.001), and flexibility by 4° (p < 0.01), whereas the control group increased hamstring peak torques only in eccentric at 30°·s-1 by 6% (p ≤ 0.05) and at 120°·s-1 by 6% (p < 0.01). It was concluded that an additional swing phase-specific hamstring eccentric training in sprinters seems to be crucial to address different risk factors for hamstring strain injuries, such as eccentric and concentric strength, hamstring-To-quadriceps ratio ratio, and flexibility. © 2016 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - In Europe, concentrically braced frames (CBFs) with double angle bracings are the most frequent lateral-resistant structural systems. Although their standard bolted connections provide economic and robust solutions for the static loading, they are assumed to have almost zero ductility under strong earthquake actions. In order to avoid a brittle failure, the current seismic design requirements of European Code provisions require these joints to have sufficient over-strength, and to remain elastic for the design earthquake. While this is a safe approach for the high seismicity situations, it causes costly solutions for the buildings designed in the low-to-moderate seismicity context. Therefore, mainly for economy reasons, design engineers usually choose standard non-seismic approach (DCL) for the design of CBFs located in low-to-moderate seismic regions. However, such a choice may lead to unsafe solutions, since no effort is paid to control ductility. To combine safety and economy in this context, a new specific method has been studied in the recently concluded EU-RFCS MEAKADO project. To explore the inherent ductility provided by standard double-angle bracing joints with preloaded bolts and respecting new edge-spacing requirements, full scale tests have been performed as a project task. This article analyses the test results, and quantifies the ductility provided by the bolt hole ovalization and the slippage of preloaded bolts of the bracing joints not fulfilling the current over-strength design criteria. The test data has been analysed by means of LVDTs, strain gauges and thermal images. Such ductility and dissipation resources are traditionally not desired from a high seismicity design point of view, but may satisfy the low horizontal shear demand of the buildings designed for the low-to-moderate earthquake zones. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017.

AB  - Tomato can be injured by two very important physiological disorders, namely blossom end rot (BER) and fruit cracking (FC). The purpose of this review is to describe these physiological disorders and to assess whether cultivar and cropping system can minimise their symptoms. Physiological Ca deficiency is usually related to the inability of the plant to translocate adequate Ca to the affected plant part, rather than to insufficient Ca levels in the growing medium. The first visible symptom of BER is a small darkened or water-soaked area around the blossom end of the fruit, appearing about the time the fruit begins to ripen. The spot darkens, enlarges, and becomes sunken as the fruit matures. Large lesions may show in concentric rings. FC is the splitting of the epidermis around the calyx or stem scar. FC is a physiological disorder, which mainly occurs when there is a rapid net influx of solutes and especially water into the fruit, while at the same time ripening or other factors reduce the strength and elasticity of the tomato skin. This review article gives an overview of the causes of BER and FC and summarizes growing methods aimed at reducing these physiological disorders of tomatoes. © 2016 The Journal of Horticultural Science & Biotechnology Trust.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in muscle strength, power, and somatic parameters in elite volleyball players after a specific pre-season training programme aimed at improving jumping and strength performance and injury prevention. Twelve junior female volleyball players participated in an 8-week training programme. Anthropometric characteristics, isokinetic peak torque (PT) single-joint knee flexion (H) and extension (Q) at 60°/s and 180°/s, counter movement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), and reactive strength index (RSI) were measured before and after intervention. Significant moderate effects were found in flexor concentric PT at 60°/s and at 180 °/s in the dominant leg (DL) (18.3±15.1%, likely; 17.8±11.2%, very likely) and in extensor concentric PT at 180°/s (7.4%±7.8%, very likely) in the DL. In the non-dominant leg (NL) significant moderate effects were found in flexor concentric PT at 60°/s and at 180°/s (13.7±11.3%, likely; 13.4±8.0%, very likely) and in extensor concentric PT at 180°/s (10.7±11.5%, very likely). Small to moderate changes were observed for H/QCONV in the DL at 60°/s and 180°/s (15.9±14.1%; 9.6±10.4%, both likely) and in the NL at 60°/s (moderate change, 9.6±11.8%, likely), and small to moderate decreases were detected for H/QFUNC at 180°/s, in both the DL and NL (-7.0±8.3%, likely; -9.5±10.0%, likely). Training-induced changes in jumping performance were trivial (for RSI) to small (for CMJ and SJ). The applied pre-season training programme induced a number of positive changes in physical performance and risk of injury, despite a lack of changes in body mass and composition.

AB  - Purpose of review: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an important consequence of hypertension, is traditionally classified as either concentric or eccentric based on the presence or absence of increased relative wall thickness. In 2010, we proposed a novel four-tiered classification that accounted for LV dilatation in addition to LV wall thickness. The purpose of this review is to discuss the rationale for this revised classification and highlight subsequent studies that have assessed its utility. Recent findings: A series of recent observational studies have tested whether the four-tiered classification identifies subphenotypes of LVH with differential risk of adverse outcomes, including incident heart failure. The majority have confirmed that eccentric hypertrophy can be subdivided into a high-risk and a low-risk group based on whether LV dilatation is present. Additional studies have shown that LV dilatation is an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure. Summary: Incorporation of LV dilatation into the assessment of LVH identifies important subphenotypes within the standard two-tiered classification that have differential risk. Such refinements in the classification of LVH may yield new insights into how LVH progresses to heart failure, help identify risk factors for this transition, and improve therapeutic efforts to prevent its occurrence.

AB  - The traditional 2D MUSIC algorithm fixes the azimuth or the elevation, and searches for the other without considering the directions of sources. A spectrum peak diffusion effect phenomenon is observed and may be utilized to detect the approximate directions of sources. Accordingly, a fast 2D MUSIC algorithm, which performs azimuth and elevation simultaneous searches (henceforth referred to as AESS) based on only three rounds of search is proposed. Firstly, AESS searches along a circle to detect the approximate source directions. Then, a subsequent search is launched along several straight lines based on these approximate directions. Finally, the 2D Direction of Arrival (DOA) of each source is derived by searching on several small concentric circles. Unlike the 2D MUSIC algorithm, AESS does not fix any azimuth and elevation parameters. Instead, the adjacent point of each search possesses different azimuth and elevation, i.e., azimuth and elevation are simultaneously searched to ensure that the search path is minimized, and hence the total spectral search over the angular field of view is avoided. Simulation results demonstrate the performance characters of the proposed AESS over some existing algorithms. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots are complex morphological traits that can vary in size, shape and color composition even on the same wing surface. Homology among eyespots suggests they share a common developmental basis and function as an integrated unit in response to selection. Despite strong evidence of genetic integration, eyespots can also exhibit modularity or plasticity, indicating an underlying flexibility in pattern development. The extent to which particular eyespots or eyespot color elements exhibit modularity or integration is poorly understood, particularly following exposure to novel conditions. We used perturbation experiments to explore phenotypic correlations among different eyespots and their color elements on the ventral hindwing of V. cardui. Specifically, we identified which eyespots and eyespot features are most sensitive to perturbation by heat shock and injection of heparin-a cold shock mimic. For both treatments, the two central eyespots (3 + 4) were most affected by the experimental perturbations, whereas the outer eyespot border was more resistant to modification than the interior color elements. Overall, the individual color elements displayed a similar response to heat shock across all eyespots, but varied in their response to each other. Graphical modeling also revealed that although eyespots differ morphologically, regulation of eyespot size and colored elements appear to be largely integrated across the wing. Patterns of integration, however, were disrupted following heat shock, revealing that the strength of integration varies across the wing and is strongest between the two central eyespots. These findings support previous observations that document coupling between eyespots 3 + 4 in other nymphalid butterflies. © 2016 Connahs et al.

AB  - Background: Developmental studies on butterfly wing color patterns often focus on eyespots. A typical eyespot (such as that of Bicyclus anynana) has a few concentric rings of dark and light colors and a white spot (called a focus) at the center. The prospective eyespot center during the early pupal stage is known to act as an organizing center. It has often been assumed, according to gradient models for positional information, that a white spot in adult wings corresponds to an organizing center and that the size of the white spot indicates how active that organizing center was. However, there is no supporting evidence for these assumptions. To evaluate the feasibility of these assumptions in nymphalid butterflies, we studied the unique color patterns of Calisto tasajera (Nymphalidae, Satyrinae), which have not been analyzed before in the literature. Results: In the anterior forewing, one white spot was located at the center of an eyespot, but another white spot associated with either no or only a small eyespot was present in the adjacent compartment. The anterior hindwing contained two adjacent white spots not associated with eyespots, one of which showed a sparse pattern. The posterior hindwing contained two adjacent pear-shaped eyespots, and the white spots were located at the proximal side or even outside the eyespot bodies. The successive white spots within a single compartment along the midline in the posterior hindwing showed a possible trajectory of a positional determination process for the white spots. Several cases of focus-less eyespots in other nymphalid butterflies were also presented. Conclusions: These results argue for the uncoupling of white spots from eyespot bodies, suggesting that an eyespot organizing center does not necessarily differentiate into a white spot and that a prospective white spot does not necessarily signify organizing activity for an eyespot. Incorporation of these results in future models for butterfly wing color pattern formation is encouraged. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - European seismic design codes do not take into account the strength and stiffness of the secondary frame action provided by bracing gusset plates of concentrically braced frames (CBFs). This is an attractive assumption for practicing engineers, as it provides simplifications during the analysis and design phases. However, when efficiency and economy are concerned, especially in low-to-moderate seismic regions, this normally neglected frame resource may be interesting to consider in design. Gusset plates can provide a certain degree of stiffness and strength following the bracing failure, and may even prevent global collapse. In particular, when the shear deformation demand of the braced cell remains limited, as in the case of low-to-moderate seismic actions, it may become reasonable to take this extra stiffness and strength into account. Ongoing research project RFSR-CT-2013-00022 MEAKADO investigated this phenomenon by means of experimental and numerical studies with the perspective of setting new inputs for the design rules of the future generation of Eurocodes. This paper presents the results of full scale tests performed inside this research project, which characterized resistance, stiffness, and ductility resources of CBF systems designed for moderate seismicity. The paper also quantifies the effective contribution of the frame action, provided by gusset plate connections, to the global performance of CBF frames. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Purpose and methods: The anal sinuses, small furrows above the pectinate line, sometimes form perianal abscesses in adults. We examined the pattern of fetal growth of the anal sinus and sphincters using 22 mid-term (8–18 weeks) and 6 late-stage (30–38 weeks) fetuses. Results: In mid-term fetuses, the external and internal sphincters gradually increased in thickness, depending on specimen size (from 0.2 to 1.5 mm), whereas the anteroposterior diameter of the anal canal at the epithelial junction was relatively stable (0.5–1.0 mm) irrespective of specimen size. Anal canal diameter increased less than twofold between mid-term and late-stage fetuses, from 0.5–1.0 to almost 2 mm, whereas sphincter thickness increased over tenfold, from 0.2–1.5 to almost 3.5 mm. The anal sinus often showed balloon-like enlargement when the sphincter muscle bundles were tightly packed in mid-term, but not in late-stage fetuses. Conclusions: Large concentric mechanical stress from the sphincters in late-stage fetuses apparently prevented the anal sinus from expanding in a balloon-like manner. Conversely, to avoid anal stenosis, the growing sinuses maintained a luminal space of the anal canal in response to stress from rapidly growing sphincters. The inferiorly extending sinus usually provided temporal double canals separated by a thick column. In the presence of double lumens, anal canal duplication is likely to develop without any abnormalities of the anal epithelium and sphincters. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A climate-related shift in the range boundaries of the western–central Eurasian subboreal species Melanargia russiae in the Ural region from the northern forest-steppe zone to pine–birch forests was found. Morphological variation of M. russiae wings from the boundary northern populations and populations from the main part of the range in the Urals were studied. The results of a complex analysis of the morphological traits (size, wing shape, and wing pattern eyespots) confirm the hypothesis that the local population formed in the south of Sverdlovsk oblast and contradict the hypothesis of the migratory origin of M. russiae imago. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Due to the rectilinear nature of the previous 3D seismic survey, the details necessary for proper interpretation were absent. Theoretically, concentric 3D seismic technology may provide an avenue for gaining more and higher quality data coverage. Problems associated with recording a rectilinear 3D seismic grid over the salt dome in this area have created the need to investigate the use of such procedures as the concentriccircle1 3D seismic acquisition technique. The difficulty of imaging salt dome flanks with conventional rectilinear 3D seismic may be a result of our inability to precisely predict the lateral velocity-field variation adjacent to both salt and sediments. The dramatic difference in the interval velocities of salt and sediments causes the returning ray to severely deviate from being a hyperbolic path. This hampers our ability to predict imaging points near the salt/sediment interface. Perhaps the most difficult areas to image with rectilinear seismic surveys are underneath salt overhangs. Modeling suggests that a significant increase in the number of rays captured from beneath a salt overhang can be achieved with the concentric-circle method. In addition and most importantly, the majority of rays imaging underneath an overhang are propagating through sediments only and improve our ability to predict imaging points near the salt/sediment interface. This paper demonstrates the use of the "circle shoot" on a survey conducted over a salt dome in the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 80 concentric circles cover an area which is equivalent to 3 1,000 acres. The final post-stack data were sorted into bins with dimensions of 25 meters by 25 meters. A comparison of 3D rectilinear shooting vs. 3D concentric circle shooting over the same area will show an improvement in data quality and signal-to-noise characteristics. © 1994 SEG Annual Meeting.

AB  - Four different processes of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) combined with rejuvenation heat treatments (RHT) were adopted to reveal the microstructural evolution of creep damaged DZ125 specimens, finally the mechanical properties were evaluated.The results show that both γ' precipitate degeneration and creep cavities for the creep damaged DZ125 superalloy are found after the pre-endurance damage test.However, the carbided compositions from MC type to M23C6 type or M6C type has not been observed for DZ125.In addition, it is found that the HIP temperature play a dominant role in the cavity healing process for the damaged specimens. The concentrically oriented γ' rafting structure and the incipient melting are observed at 1200℃ and 1250℃ respectively.Meanwhile, it is found that the appropriate HIP schedule adopted can effectively avoid the internal recrystallization for the directionally solidified nickel-based superalloy DZ125. The appropriate HIP schedule combined with RHT process can successfully restore the microstructure induced by creep damage and recover the degraded micro-hardness to the original one, in addition improve the creep rupture life. © 2017, Journal of Materials Engineering.

AB  - The Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) is effective for selective hamstring strengthening to improve muscle balance between knee flexors and extensors. The purpose of this study (within subject design of repeated measures) was to determine the effects of a standardized 4-week NHE training on thigh strength and muscle balance with concomitant kinetic and kinematic monitoring. Sixteen male sprinters (22 years, 181 cm, 76 kg) performed a standardized 4-week NHE training consisting of three sessions per week (each 3×3 repetitions). Six rope-assisted and six unassisted sessions were performed targeting at a constant knee extension angular velocity of ~15°/s across a ~90-100° knee joint range of motion. Kinetic (peak and mean moment, impulse) and kinematic parameters (eg, ROM to downward acceleration, ROMDWA) were recorded during selected sessions. Unilateral isokinetic tests of concentric and eccentric knee flexors and extensors quantified muscle group-, contraction mode-, and velocity-specific training adaptations. Peak moments and contractional work demonstrated strong interactions of time with muscle group, contraction modes, and angular velocities (η²>.150). NHE training increased eccentric hamstring strength by 6%-14% as well as thigh muscle balance with biggest adaptations at 150°/s 2 weeks after NHE training. Throughout the training period significant increases (P<.001) of peak (η²=.828) and mean moments (η²=.611) became apparent, whereas the impulse and the ROMDWA of unassisted NHE repetitions remained unchanged (P>.05). A 4-week NHE training significantly strengthened the hamstrings and improved muscle balance between knee flexors and extensors. Despite the slow training velocity, biggest adaptations emerged at the highest velocity 2 weeks after training ended. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is a vascular condition characterized by concentric arteriosclerotic thickening of the intima of arteries within transplanted organs and also involves functional abnormalities that prevent proper vasodilation. It occurs in all solid organ transplants and is established in heart transplantation to be a main cause of late graft failure. The structural and functional changes that occur in TA compromise blood flow and lead to ischemic damage of the graft. The pathogenesis of TA involves immune targeting of vascular cells, which results in vascular cell damage and dysfunction. The resultant response of blood vessels to these immune-driven alterations leads to arteriosclerotic thickening and vasomotor dysfunction. Here, we discuss the immunopathological mechanisms underlying the development of TA and current therapeutic strategies for its prevention. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lateral loads primarily induce axial loads in members of steel concentrically braced frames but columns may also be subjected to drift induced bending moments that may affect their strength and stability. The article discusses three examples of CBF columns that are subjected to combined axial compression and bending moments in structures under severe seismic ground motions: columns at an intermediate level where soft-story response develops in an existing seismically deficient X-bracing, fixed base columns at the first level of a well-proportioned multi-story X-bracing system, and columns in multi-tiered braced steel frames. Nonlinear dynamic analysis of the columns is performed to examine their stability response under axial and bending demands. In the first two cases, the results indicate that bending moments have limited effects on the global stability of the columns. Conversely, columns in multi-tiered frames must be designed to resist the expected combined axial and flexural demands in order to prevent column instability. © ASCE.

AB  - Robust image hashing techniques have been extensively studied in the recent years, with constant improvements. The challenge is that the hashing schemes need to be robust to most content-preservation operations (CPOs) and at the same time have reliable discriminative capability. One of the most important application of such image hashing techniques is image authentication. Most of the existing image hashing techniques are not robust to geometric attacks e.g. rotation and composite rotation-scaling-translation (RST). In this paper, we propose a novel image authentication model that uses a blind approach for geometric distortion correction. The hashing scheme is based on concentric square partition and statistical feature vector distances, thus making it perceptually robust and at the same time sensitive to visually distinct images. Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art models and gives desirable result for all CPOs and geometric attacks as well. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The heart itself ageing is characterized by structural and functional changes, determined just by older age, even in absence of cardiovascular pathology. Carbohydrate metabolism disorders, based upon the insulin resistance, are common in elderly, and worsen the processes of ageing, including the heart. Structural changes in the heart are characterized by development of concentric remodelling of the left ventricle myocardium, and functional - by diastolic function impairment, with saved systolic function. The review focuses on the influence of ageing and carbohydrate metabolism disorders on the structure and function of myocardium, and the obvious fact is discussed, that earlier screening and correction of insulin resistance and glucose metabolism disorders might prevent or delay the progression of age-related heart failure.

AB  - Location-based social discovery (LBSD) services enable users to discover their geographic neighborhoods to make new friends. Original LBSD services were designed to provide the exact distances to nearby users. It has been shown that it is easy to pinpoint any target user's location by using trilateration based on the exact distances from three fake Global Positioning System locations to the target user. To defend against the trilateration attack, contemporary LBSD services then began to report distances of nearby users in concentric bands, for example, bands of 100 meters, rather than exact distances. In this paper, we investigate the user location privacy leakage problem in LBSD services reporting distances in discrete bands. Using number theory, we analytically show that by strategically placing multiple virtual probes with fake Global Positioning System locations, one can nevertheless localize user locations in band-based LBSD. Our methodology is guaranteed to localize any reported user within a circle of radius no greater than one meter, even for LBSD services using large bands (such as 100 m as used by WeChat). Eventually, countermeasures are proposed to reduce location privacy leakage to the very minimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly exploits and quantifies user location privacy leakage in band-based LBSD services. We expect our study to draw more public attention to this serious privacy issue and expectantly motivate better privacy preserving LBSD designs. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a high gain antenna with a nearly unidirectional radiation pattern. The antenna is composed of concentric complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) that radiate at different frequencies as determined by the circumference of each ring slot as well as the mutual coupling between them. The antenna is optimized for operation at 2.45 GHz, which is one of the frequencies commonly used for body-worn communication devices. It is found that the concentric CSRRs behave like a filter in the radial direction and prevent surface currents from reaching the edges of the ground plane resulting in broadside radiation. The antenna shows a return loss of higher than 25 dB in both measurement and simulation. The front-to-back ratio (FTBR) is improved by backing the ring slots with a metallic rectangular cavity yielding FTBR of 21.2 dB and gain of 7.87 dB in measurements. The achieved radiation characteristics prove that the designed antenna is a good potential candidate for body-worn communication devices, where human body exposure to radiation must be minimal. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The presence of rocks in the ejecta of craters at the InSight landing site in southwestern Elysium Planitia indicates a strong, rock-producing unit at depth. A finer regolith above is inferred by the lack of rocks in the ejecta of 10-m-scale craters. This regolith should be penetrable by the mole of the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3). An analysis of the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of 7988 rocky ejecta craters (RECs) across four candidate landing ellipses reveals that all craters >200 m in diameter and <750±30Ma in age have boulder-sized rocks in their ejecta. The frequency of RECs however decreases significantly below this diameter (D), represented by a roll-off in the SFD slope. At 30m<D<200m, the slope of the cumulative SFD declines to near zero at D<30m. Surface modification, resolution limits, or human counting error cannot account for the magnitude of this roll-off. Rather, a significant population of <200 m diameter fresh non-rocky ejecta craters (NRECs) here indicates the presence of a relatively fine-grained regolith that prevents smaller craters from excavating the strong rock-producing unit. Depth to excavation relationships and the REC size thresholds indicate the region is capped by a regolith that is almost everywhere 3 m thick but may be as thick as 12 to 18 m. The lower bound of the thickness range is independently confirmed by the depth to the inner crater in concentric or nested craters. The data indicate that 85% of the InSight landing region is covered by a regolith that is at least 3 m thick. The probability of encountering rockier material at depths >3 m by the HP3 however increases significantly due to the increase in boulder-size rocks in the lower regolith column, near the interface of the bedrock. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Typhoons with long-lived concentric eyewalls (CEs) are more intense than those with short-lived CEs. It is important for more accurate prediction of typhoon intensity to understand the maintenance mechanism of the long-lived CEs. To study the mechanism of the long-term maintenance of CEs, a numerical experiment of Typhoon Bolaven (2012) is performed using a nonhydrostatic model with full physics. Two aspects of the maintenance of simulated CEs are investigated: the maintenance of the inner eyewall and the contraction of the outer eyewall. To examine the maintenance of the inner eyewall, the equivalent potential temperature budget and air parcel trajectories of the simulated inner eyewall are calculated. The results show that the entropy supply to the inner eyewall is sufficient to maintain the inner eyewall after secondary eyewall formation (SEF). During the early period after SEF, entropy is supplied by an axisymmetric inflow, and later it is supplied by nonaxisymmetric flows of the outer eyewall. To examine the contraction of the outer eyewall, the potential vorticity (PV) budget of the outer eyewall is diagnosed. The result reveals that the negative contribution to the contraction of the outer PV peak (i.e., the outer eyewall) in the early period is the negative PV generation due to axisymmetric advection and diabatic heating just inside of the outer PV peak. In the later period, the negative PV generation due to nonaxisymmetric structure is important for the prevention of contraction. The present study reveals that the structure of the outer eyewall plays important roles in the maintenance of long-lived CEs. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - This study investigated the spatial distribution of an Amazonian fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage by linking species taxonomic and functional approaches. We hypothesized that: 1) vegetation richness (i.e., resources) and abundance of insectivorous birds (i.e., predators) should drive changes in butterfly taxonomic composition, 2) larval diet breadth should decrease with increase of plant species richness, 3) small-sized adults should be favored by higher abundance of birds, and 4) communities with eyespot markings should be able to exploit areas with higher predation pressure. Fruit-feeding butterflies were sampled with bait traps and insect nets across 25 km 2 of an Amazonian ombrophilous forest in Brazil. We measured larval diet breadth, adult body size, and wing marking of all butterflies. Our results showed that plant species richness explained most of the variation in butterfly taxonomic turnover. Also, community average diet breadth decreased with increase of plant species richness, which supports our expectations. In contrast, community average body size increased with the abundance of birds, refuting our hypothesis. We detected no influence of environmental gradients on the occurrence of species with eyespot markings. The association between butterfly taxonomic and functional composition points to a mediator role of the functional traits in the environmental filtering of butterflies. The incorporation of the functional approach into the analyses allowed for the detection of relationships that were not observed using a strictly taxonomic perspective and provided an extra insight into comprehending the potential adaptive strategies of butterflies.  © 2015 The Authors 2015.

AB  - Bacterial sporulation allows starving cells to differentiate into metabolically dormant spores that can survive extreme conditions. Following asymmetric division, the mother cell engulfs the forespore, surrounding it with two bilayer membranes. During the engulfment process, an essential channel, the so-called feeding tube apparatus, is thought to cross both membranes to create a direct conduit between the mother cell and the forespore. At least nine proteins are required to create this channel, including SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAA-AH. Here, we present the near-atomic resolution structure of one of these proteins, SpoIIIAG, determined by single-particle cryo-EM. A 3D reconstruction revealed that SpoIIIAG assembles into a large and stable 30-fold symmetric complex with a unique mushroom-like architecture. The complex is collectively composed of three distinctive circular structures: a 60-stranded vertical β-barrel that forms a large inner channel encircled by two concentric rings, one β-mediated and the other formed by repeats of a ring-building motif (RBM) common to the architecture of various dual membrane secretion systems of distinct function. Our near-atomic resolution structure clearly shows that SpoIIIAG exhibits a unique and dramatic adaptation of the RBM fold with a unique β-triangle insertion that assembles into the prominent channel, the dimensions of which suggest the potential passage of large macromolecules between the mother cell and forespore during the feeding process. Indeed, mutation of residues located at key interfaces between monomers of this RBM resulted in severe defects both in vivo and in vitro, providing additional support for this unprecedented structure. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The lunar regolith can provide critical information about the Moon and the space environment. In the study of lunar regolith, thickness is one of its most important parameters because of the significance in estimating the relative geologic age and the quantities of solar wind implanted volatiles. In this research, an improved morphological method for determining the lunar regolith thickness is proposed by directly measuring the distance from the lunar ground surface to the floor (flat-bottomed and central-mound craters) or bench (concentric craters) of indicative small fresh craters. The pre-impact ground surface is first modeled with crater edge points through plane fitting, avoiding crater ejecta. Then the lunar regolith thickness is calculated as the distance between the modeled ground surface and the crater floor or bench. The method has been verified at the landing sites of Chang'E-3 rover with high-resolution stereo images from Chang'E-2 orbiter, and the landing sites of Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions with high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter DEM data. All the results are in good agreement with results from in-situ measurements, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method. This method can be applied to estimate lunar regolith thickness where high-precision topographic data is available. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Collapse analyses of buildings under fire are relatively lacking. Recent events, particularly the 9/11 terrorists attack, have spiked interest in assessing the full collapse behavior of buildings under fire. In this study, a 3D numerical model of a composite steel frame is developed, and its performance evaluated under fire up to and including collapse. The frame is a hybrid 6-story building with moment, gravity, and concentrically braced frames. The building is subjected to the ASTM E119 standard fire curve for two different scenarios – firstfloor corner compartment fire and whole first-floor fire. The results show that the full structural response including the collapse mechanism during fire events can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using advanced numerical finite element analysis. The results also show collapse initiation to be triggered following the failure of few columns, as opposed to one column, highlighting the importance of the analysis for performance-based engineering. © 2020, American Institute of Steel Construction, AISC.

AB  - In this paper, the seismic behavior of BRBF structures is studied and compared with special concentric braced frames (SCBF). To this purpose, three BRBF and three SCBF structures with 3, 5 and 10 stories are designed based on AISC360-5 and modelled using OpenSees. These structures are loaded in accordance with ASCE/SEI 7-10. Incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis (IDA) are performed on these structures for 28 different accelerograms and the median IDA curves are used to compare seismic capacity of these two systems. Results obtained, indicates that BRBF systems provide higher capacity for the target performance level in comparison with SCBF systems. And structures with high altitude (in this study, 5 and 10 stories) with the possibility of exceeding the collapse prevention performance level, further than lower altitude (here 3 floors) structures. © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - Binary and ternary combinations of volatile organic compounds identified earlier from caterpillar-infested apple foliage caught more than one thousand individuals of both sexes of several adult tortricid leafroller species in several days of trials conducted in apple orchards in southern British Columbia. A series of combinations with phenylacetonitrile, benzyl alcohol, and/or 2-phenylethanol and acetic acid enabled substantial catches of both sexes of eye-spotted budmoth, Spilonota ocellana, oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana and three-lined leafroller, Pandemis limitata. These findings suggest that new monitoring aides can be developed to seasonally track populations, enabling practical applications in surveillance of female leafroller populations for the first time. It may also be possible to develop suppression tools based on combinations of kairomone compounds originally identified from leafroller larval-damaged apple trees, given the level of attraction. The discovery of these adult tortricid attractants (aromatic compounds plus acetic acid) raises new ecological questions about evolved direct plant defences against herbivores. Larval feeding-induced attraction of adult herbivores produces signals that are potentially harmful to the plant by increasing herbivory in the same family and probably feeding guild, but evidence for effects on plant fitness is needed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A dual band sleeve dipole antenna for WLAN application is presented. The antenna covers both the WLAN bands. The proposed antenna exhibits excellent omni-directional characteristics and reflection properties S11 values which are less than -10db. The dipole is constructed from two concentric hallow cylinders having different radius and different lengths. The complicated balun network is avoided by feeding the antenna at the center with the help of coaxial cable. The scattering parameters and radiation patterns are simulated using CST microwave studio. These simulation results are validated by the measured results. The antenna is best suitable for airborne and outdoor applications. © 2016 European Association of Antennas and Propagation.

AB  - The aim of the current review is to discuss applications and mechanism of eccentric exercise in training regimes of competitive sports. Eccentric muscle work is important in most sports. Eccentric muscle contractions enhance the performance during the concentric phase of stretch-shortening cycles, which is important in disciplines like sprinting, jumping, throwing, and running. Muscles activated during lengthening movements can also function as shock absorbers, to decelerate during landing tasks or to precisely deal with high external loading in sports like alpine skiing. The few studies available on trained subjects reveal that eccentric training can further enhance maximal muscle strength and power. It can further optimize muscle length for maximal tension development at a greater degree of extension, and has potential to improve muscle coordination during eccentric tasks. In skeletal muscles, these functional adaptations are based on increases in muscle mass, fascicle length, number of sarcomeres, and cross-sectional area of type II fibers. Identified modalities for eccentric loading in athletic populations involve classical isotonic exercises, accentuated jumping exercises, eccentric overloading exercises, and eccentric cycle ergometry. We conclude that eccentric exercise offers a promising training modality to enhance performance and to prevent injuries in athletes. However, further research is necessary to better understand how the neuromuscular system adapts to eccentric loading in athletes. Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Studies were conducted to assess glacial acetic acid (GAA) with various host plant volatiles (HPVs) and the sex pheromone, (E,E)-8, 10-dodecadien-1-ol, of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L), as lures in traps for tortricid pests that often co-occur in tree fruits in the western United States. In addition to codling moth, field trapping studies were conducted with oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), the leafroller Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott, and the eyespotted budmoth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermüller). HPVs included ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester), (E)-4,8dimethyl-l,3,7-nonatriene, butyl hexanoate, (E)-β-ocimene, (E)-β-farnesene, and farnesol. Three types of GAA co-lures differing in a 10-fold range in weekly evaporation rates were tested. The evaporation rate of GAA co-lures was an important factor affecting moth catches. The highest rate tested captured fewer codling moth but more leafrollers and eyespotted budmoth. GAA co-lures caught both sexes of each species. The field life of butyl hexanoate and (E)-β-ocimene lures were much shorter than pear ester or sex pheromone lures. Adding GAA to pear ester or to (E)-β-ocimene significantly increased the catches of only codling moth or oriental fruit moth, respectively. Combining pear ester or (E) -β-ocimene with GAA did not affect the catch of either species compared with the single more attractive HPV. Adding HPVs to GAA did not increase the catches of either leafroller species or eyespotted budmoth. Traps baited with pear ester, sex pheromone, and GAA for monitoring codling moth were also effective in classifying pest pressure of both leafroller species within orchards. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - ›Muscle fatigue can affect the absorption of impact forces during running and increase the risk for running injuries. Conflicting results exist about the change of plantar pressure maxima. The study aimed to examine the influence of a standardized fatigue protocol on plantar pressure distribution of rearfoot strike runners considering leg strength asymmetries. ›In a laboratory test with repeated-measures, 30 male runners participated after familiarization on the treadmill (11-15 km/h). An isokinetic fatigue protocol included ten sets of six concentric contractions (10s set break, ω=60°/s). The peak pressure under the forefoot, midfoot and heel were tested with an analysis of variance. ›In the strength test, the left leg was stronger and showed higher plantar pressure under the heel, even during fatigue in the treadmill test. The plantar flexors decreased to 52-61% and the dorsiflexors to 35-41% of the isometric maximum strength. Maximum of plantar pressure under the heel and forefoot decreased to 8.3% and 5.9%. ›As hypothesized, there was a leg asymmetry and the fatigue protocol reduced the performance of dorsiflexors more intensely, because plantar flexors are more fatigue-resistant due to their greater muscle mass. The reductions in pressure values may indicate a possible protective strategy to counteract injuries during muscle fatigue. For injury prevention, strength training of the foot muscles with focus on dorsiflexors and the weaker leg is recommended, in addition to running. © 2016, WWF Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

AB  - To address the structural problems caused by eccentric loads in unreinforced masonry, three different types of masonry were prepared based on clay bricks bonded with a natural hydraulic lime mortar combined with a flax or polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO) fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composite. The mechanical behaviour when subjected to concentric and eccentric loads was studied by performing axial compression tests, with eccentric load tests only carried out in instances of large eccentricities. Analysis of the load-displacement and moment-curvature response revealed that both the flax- and PBO-based strengthening systems improve the strength and deformability of masonry. However, compared to the PBO fabric composite, the use of flax fabric provides a greater deformability that helps prevent the composite and substrate debonding. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - aim. Good muscular strength is decisive to manage tasks of daily life and to prevent falls. However, within recommendations of resistance training for counteracting the age-related loss of muscle mass, is a lack of information about training control. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the implementation of two different protocols of training control (intensity-controlled through percentage [%] of maximum strength [1RM] versus repetition-controlled) during resistance training with older adults on time-under-tension (TUT) and physical work. Methods. Fourteen older adults (age of 64.8±3.1 years) participated in this cross-sectional test-retest study and were measured at an interval of one week with two different protocols (intensity-controlled [CInt] versus repetition-controlled [CRep]) in the exercise 'seated chest press'. Results. Within CInt, the repetitions were reduced by about 49% across the sets; in CRep the load was reduced by about 20% across the sets. There was no significant difference with respect to executed repetitions and TUT between CInt and CRep, but there was a significant difference between single sets (p<0.001). Physical work demonstrated a significant reduction across the sets in CRep. Total physical work was higher in CRep (4934 N·m) compared to CInt (4349 N·m). Conclusion. A target number of repetitions with adapted load (repetition-controlled protocol) in consecutive sets was preferable if a high amount of physical work should be achieved and load intensity should not increase in subsequent sets. With the repetition- controlled protocol, high mechanical and metabolic stress is presumable, resulting in higher hypertrophic effects.

AB  - Hamstrings injuries are one of the most frequent injuries in football players. Exercise programs leading to lower levels of injury, diminishing their recurrence and severity are extremely important for coaches, physical therapist and players. To recognize the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of exercise intervention programs in the prevention of hamstring injuries, in male football players. Different studies were selected for revision from several databases. To evaluate the methodological quality of these studies we used the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and determined the strength of the evidence using the best evidence synthesis grading system. The used exercise programs where based in concentric and eccentric strength, the eccentric strength exercise Nordic Hamstrings, The FIFA 11+, and flexibility exercises. The variables studied were: the incidence, the incidence of new injuries, recurrence of injuries, the severity, and the risk of injuries. The concentric and eccentric strength program and the Nordic Hamstrings program seem to be the most effective in reducing the incidence of injuries and the incidence of new injuries, respectively (limited evidence). The Nordic Hamstrings program does not reduce the risk of injuries (limited evidence) and does not improve the level of severity of the injuries (moderate evidence). The FIFA 11+program does not reduce the incidence of injuries (limited evidence). There are contradictory evidences on the other variables. © 2015, Redprint Editora Ltda. All Rights Reserved

AB  - Due to a high incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) re-injury in alpine ski racers, this study aims to assess functional asymmetry in the countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), and leg muscle mass in elite ski racers with and without anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Elite alpine skiers with ACL-R (n=9; 26.2±11.8 months post-op) and uninjured skiers (n=9) participated in neuromuscular screening. Vertical ground reaction force during the CMJ and SJ was assessed using dual force plate methodology to obtain phase-specific bilateral asymmetry indices (AIs) for kinetic impulse (CMJ and SJ phase-specific kinetic impulse AI). Dual x-ray absorptiometry scanning was used to assess asymmetry in lower body muscle mass. Compared with controls, ACL-R skiers had increased AI in muscle mass (P<0.001), kinetic impulse AI in the CMJ concentric phase (P<0.05), and the final phase of the SJ (P<0.05). Positive associations were observed between muscle mass and AI in the CMJ concentric phase (r=0.57, P<0.01) as well as in the late SJ phase (r=0.66, P<0.01). Future research is required to assess the role of the CMJ and SJ phase-specific kinetic impulse AI as a part of a multifaceted approach for improving outcome following ACL-R in elite ski racers. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Most of existing works on the tubes design optimization of concentric-tube robot (CTR) do not include the elastic stability in the optimization criteria. The only work which formulates the elastic stability in the objective function is based on scalarization method which is used in existing multi-objective design optimization. The objective function is formed by a set of weighted objective functions. The selection of the weights is crucial as the optimization results are greatly affected by them and could be misleading if these weights are improperly chosen. As an alternative optimization technique, we use Pareto grid-searching method to avoid this problem and allow a straightforward interpretation of the results following the selection criteria for the parameters to be optimized. This paper shows a three-tube CTR design based on Pareto grid-searching method in order to optimize the reachability and elastic stability of the CTR within a specific curvature range dedicated to the deep anterior brain tumor removal surgery. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates a new seismic rehabilitation technology for low-rise and mid-rise steel Concentrically Braced Frames (CBFs) vulnerable to inter-story drift concentration and soft-story failures. The technology consists of installation of a single or multiple sufficient Rocking Cores (RCs) pinned to the foundation and connected to an existing deficient multi-story CBF building to re-distribute seismic forces along its height and create more uniform inter-story drift and ductility demand distributions. Two benchmark steel CBF buildings including one three-story and one six-story are rehabilitated using the RC technology. Nonlinear static pushover analyses are conducted to demonstrate the beneficial contribution of the RC in mitigating non-uniform inter-story drift distributions in the benchmark buildings. The RC stiffness is varied and the Monte-Carlo simulation technique is adopted to generate random lateral force distributions in the nonlinear static pushover analyses. It is shown that the RC is effective in reducing inter-story drift concentration in both benchmark buildings when they reach the inter-story drift limits associated with collapse prevention, lift safety and immediate occupancy per FEMA 356. This paper also presents the strength demands on RC and the links connecting RC to existing frame from the nonlinear static pushover analyses, which are essentially caused by the first mode responses of the rehabilitated systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper focuses on migration in the context of European integration which implies, on the one hand, internal integration, integration within the EU and, on the other hand, the enlargement process related to the countries that have applied to join the EU. The aim is to determine in which way the migration, especially refugee crisis in 2015, had influence on the EU, as a supranational political community, and what was the impact on Serbia which is in the process of integration into the European Union. Migrant crisis has shown that the EU has to confront many different issues including several issues of great importance for its survival and strengthening: how to influence on global processes to a greater extent instead of dealing with the consequences of the global politics of others; how to preserve and keep the values that the EU itself is founded and the values on which should be built upon further construction of the political community and, finally, weather the EU can be transformed in the direction of the United European States, in both the functional and in terms of values, or the EU will move towards deepening of Europe of concentric circles. Faced with extremely complex migration situation, Serbia does not have the appropriate institutional and regulatory framework, nor a political response to a series of complex issues in the area of migration and migration-related issues, such as asylum system, irregular migration, sustainable return of our citizens asylum seekers in EU member states, implementation of the agreement on readmission, the departure of highly educated . brain drain, migration and development, the fight against human trafficking (protection of victims, prevention, criminal prosecution of traffickers), and smuggling of migrants, issues of border management, demarcation and boundary determination (as well as the agreement that should be concluded). Some of these problems migrant crisis has made visible by encouraging coping with the need of systemic response to the flaws in the regulatory framework, in the policy concerning asylum seekers, irregular migration through the territory of Serbia, as well as in the sustainable return of our citizens, applicants for asylum in member states. If we put all this in the context of untimely planning, ineffective management of economic trends, the lack of financial support from Brussels to deal with the refugee crisis, but also in the context of the fact that the enlargement policy is aimed at meeting the Copenhagen criteria, but not on economic growth . then the fears of uncontrolled influx of migrants pose potential capital of radical and populist political options. In the relationship with Brussels, Serbia would have to fight for more understanding regarding the state of the economy and, in general, regarding help with the costs of joining the EU, especially in case of further escalation of the migrant crisis. Serbia's image in the international arena has been changing for better because of the human attitude towards refugees and migrants who were in transit, but for the citizens of Serbia is much more important that the attitude towards them is a part of the essential changes in the society, and not juste an agile response to the crisis-i. e. what metters most is to make appropriate administrative and legal measures, to effectively manage the problems that migrant crisis put in the foreground, but primarily to change the essence of political community and to have this change of image as a result of state and society transformation towards strengthening democratic institutions, the rule of law, media freedom and developed human rights and freedoms.

AB  - We here investigate the geometry, age, and history of several enigmatic northern Thailand earthwork entrenchments that are mostly located on hills and could not have held water to form moats. The earthworks are either oval or rectangular in plan view and typically encircle 0.3 to 1 sq km areas with no potsherd debris that would indicate former towns. Most trenches are 3–5 m deep with inner walls 4.5–8m high. Some encircling earthworks are concentric double trenches spaced approximately 10 m apart. Historians have suggested these earthworks enclosed defensible areas where people in outlying villages sought refuge when under attack by neighboring rulers, the Chinese Ho, or the Burmese. We argue that some encircling entrenchments may have been for the capture or containment of elephants. Nearly all of the once near-vertical original walls have degraded to slopes of 32–47°. Fitting calculated curves of the diffusion-based scarp-degradation model to our height-slope data, and assuming most scarps have degraded since the end of La Na Kingdom time A.D. 1558, we derive a diffusion coefficient of 0.002 m2 y−1. Slopes of the rectangular earthwork at Souvannkhomkham, Laos, across the Mekong River from Chiang Saen Noi, are significantly more degraded (approximately 32°), indicating an age of 800–1200 years. Locations of these earthworks are established in hope that they will be preserved as part of the Thai and Lao archaeological legacy. © 2015, Journal of Field Archaeology. All rights reserved.

Like many other such phrases, Pindar’s label attests to the powerful idea, pervasive in early Greek poetry, that there is a natural kinship between the eye and the sun. The image of the sun as “seeing” goes back to the Homeric epics, which adopted concepts of the all-seeing sun-god from Egypt and the ancient Near East. But it is only with the emergence of Greek philosophy and science (above all from the fifth century bce onwards) that this poetic notion is converted into a systematic model of perception, based on paradigms of organic equality or even connaturality. Sun and eye are thought to share physical and operational similarities: the very emission of fire is associated with the ability to see. The fact that seeing is a capacity inherent in light and fire implies, however, that sight does not necessarily need a living body or mind to be exercised. Sight is an activity that can be unconnected, even detached, from subjectivity: it can be understood in relation to anything that is endowed with fire or reflective of light.1. © 2016 Michael Squire for selection and editorial matter.

AB  - Impact pile driving of steel piles in marine environments produces extremely high sound levels in the water, which causes deleterious effects on fauna. It has been shown that traditional pile driving noise attenuation techniques are limited because a significant portion of the noise from marine pile driving is transmitted through the sediment into the water. To combat this problem, we have developed a new double walled pile design to decrease the noise transmitted into the sediment and the water. The double walled pile shoe is designed to provide a flexible and water tight connection between two concentric piles, allowing for an air gap between the inner and outer pile. The assembly is driven into the sediment using traditional equipment by striking the inner pile only. The air gap between the inner and outer pile prevents the radial deformation wave produced by the pile hammer from interacting with the water. The outside pile is effectively decoupled from the inner pile leaving only pile toe deformations to emit acoustic pressure waves into the surroundings. The spherical nature of the pile toe source results in greater spreading loss, and the attenuation from the soil is increased as the pile is driven to greater depths. In this paper we will describe the mechanics of noise generation in both single and double walled piles as well as share results from a recent full scale field test in Puget Sound, Washington. The use of double walled piles reduces the peak sound pressure over 20 dB relative to single walled piles. We also show that only a 3 to 6 dB reduction is obtained when a bubble curtain is used on a single walled pile.

AB  - In binocular viewing, images presented to the amblyopic eye are suppressed in the cortex to prevent confusion or diplopia. The present study measures depth and extent of interocular suppression across the central circular 24° visual field in observers with strabismus and microstrabismus. Visual stimuli were concentric rings of alternating polarity, each divided into sectors. Rings were defined by luminance (L), luminance-modulated noise (LM), or contrastmodulated noise (CM). They were viewed binocularly except for the tested ring, which was viewed dichoptically, so that the modulation of one sector presented to the weaker or amblyopic eye was adjusted to perceptually match the surrounding ring presented to the preferred eye. A two alternative forced-choice paradigm combined with a staircase procedure allowed for measurement of the point of subjective equality, or perceptual match. Depth of suppression was calculated as the difference between physical modulations presented to the two eyes at this point. Strabismic participants showed suppression deeper centrally than peripherally, and in one hemifield of the visual field more than the other. Suppression was deeper for L than LM, and CM than LM stimuli. Microstrabismic suppression was weaker than that of strabismics, central for L and LM stimuli, with suppression of CM stimuli being broader, deeper and more in one hemifield. Suppression depth was positively correlated with interocular visual acuity difference and stereoacuity reduction. Clinically, LM stimuli could be used for assessment of deeper amblyopes to assess suppression patterns, while more sensitive detection of mild suppression would be possible using CM stimuli.

AB  - In order to improve the spatial distribution of spray and enhance the mixture formation quality for the diesel engines, a partition combustion system with double ω-type combustion chamber was proposed. Since the in-cylinder squish is very intense near 20°CA BTDC in the diesel engine, the double ω-type combustion chamber is divided into an upper and a lower circular region to enhance flow disturbance by setting the ridge on the combustion chamber wall. In order to better match the geometry structure of the new combustion chamber, a nozzle of double-layer hole is designed, and the position of double-layer hole is in the circular of two concentric circles. The axis intersection distance between upper and lower layer nozzle holes is 1 mm, which can effectively avoid the interference of spray. The nozzle of double-layer hole has more flexible characteristics and better spray distribution in the axial direction by changing the number and diameter. The spray from nozzle holes are respectively injected into the corresponding area in the double ω-type combustion chamber, so as to enhance the utilization rate of the air and accelerate mixture of fuel and air. The basic performance experiment is carried out in ZS1100ZM diesel engine. The results show: with decreasing the diameter of the throat mouth in the partition combustion system, there is a lower fuel consumption rate and Soot emission. Compared to the original engine, for the 65-type combustion chamber, NOx emission remains unchanged and fuel consumption reduces by 2.2% under the rated condition. The nozzle protrusion height is of great influence on the partition combustion system, and appropriate short protrusion height makes the better performance. Double ω-type combustion chamber matched with a nozzle of double-layer hole at the small and medium loads shows the better fuel consumption rate, and the proper increment on number of the upper nozzle hole can reduce Soot emission. © 2015 International Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems.

AB  - Fungicides are widely used in developed agricultural systems to control disease and safeguard crop yield and quality. Over time, however, resistance to many of the most effective fungicides has emerged and spread in pathogen populations, compromising disease control. This review describes the development of resistance using case histories based on four important diseases of temperate cereal crops: eyespot (. Oculimacula yallundae and Oculimacula acuformis), Septoria tritici blotch (. Zymoseptoria tritici), powdery mildew (. Blumeria graminis), and Fusarium ear blight (a complex of Fusarium and Microdochium spp). The sequential emergence of variant genotypes of these pathogens with reduced sensitivity to the most active single-site fungicides, methyl benzimidazole carbamates, demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors, and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors illustrates an ongoing evolutionary process in response to the introduction and use of different chemical classes. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of resistance has provided more rapid and precise methods for detecting and monitoring the incidence of resistance in field populations, but when or where resistance will occur remains difficult to predict. The extent to which the predictability of resistance evolution can be improved by laboratory mutagenesis studies and fitness measurements, comparison between pathogens, and reconstruction of evolutionary pathways is discussed. Risk models based on fungal life cycles, fungicide properties, and exposure to the fungicide are now being refined to take account of additional traits associated with the rate of pathogen evolution. Experimental data on the selection of specific mutations or resistant genotypes in pathogen populations in response to fungicide treatments can be used in models evaluating the most effective strategies for reducing or preventing resistance. Resistance management based on robust scientific evidence is vital to prolong the effective life of fungicides and safeguard their future use in crop protection. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The low oil prices have produced severe impact on the offshore industry slowing down new projects. The projects to become economically feasible shall incorporate innovative solutions for subsea equipment. In this context, the use of sandwich pipes for deepwater scenarios can be a useful alternative to conventional long distance pipelines. Sandwich pipe is a new concept composed of two concentric steel pipes separated by and bonded to a cement annulus that provides a combination of high structural strength with thermal insulation. For ultra deepwater scenarios, related to water depths beyond 1,500 m, the single wall steel pipe requires very thick wall and high insulation capacity. In this work, structural configurations for single wall pipe (SW), pipe-in-pipe (PIP) and sandwich pipe (SP) are designed for several deepwater scenarios. Collapse and buckling propagation are considered to overcome the high pressure environment while flow assurance is considered to overcome the low temperature. Simulations on flow assurance and cost evaluation will provide the basis for the comparative studies and recommendation about the appropriate scenarios for sandwich pipe applications. Flow assurance was simulated with OLGA software for the considered scenarios to avoid solid deposition. The costs related to each pipeline technology are finally compared for the established scenarios, and the sandwich pipe was considered to be a promising technology when high collapse strength and good thermal insulation are required.

AB  - A heterotrophic dinoflagellate isolated from the waters of Masan Bay, Korea was, at first glance, morphologically similar to Katodinium glandulum, yet had unreported plate patterns and DNA sequences. This dinoflagellate had thin plates arranged in a Kofoidian series Po, X, 4', 2a, 6″, 6c, PC, 3. +. s, 5‴, 0p, and 2″″, similar to species in the family Pfiesteriaceae. However, it did not have a closing plate (cp) and only small sulcal plates (3. +. s). Furthermore, this dinoflagellate had a conspicuous apical hook (finger-like projection) on the epitheca, like K. glandulum and Katodinium asymmetricum, but unlike the other Katodinium species and the other species in the family Pfiesteriaceae. The epitheca had a conical shape and was markedly larger than the hemispherical hypotheca. Cell lengths and widths of live biflagellate cells satiated with the phototrophic dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra were 21.2-29.2. μm and 18.1-24.9. μm, respectively, while those of biflagellate cells starved for 4. d were 10.2-17.3. μm and 7.7-14.6. μm, respectively. The ratio of the width of the epitheca relative to the hypotheca (0.9) is similar to that of K. glandulum, but larger than that of K. asymmetricum (0.5-0.7). The dinoflagellate had a peduncle but lacked an eyespot. The DNA sequences differed from those of K. glaucum, the only Katodinium species with reported rDNA sequences. Compared to the other known genera in the family Pfiesteriaceae, the rDNA sequences of the small subunit (SSU), ITS regions (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), and D1-D3 large subunit (LSU) differed by 1.9-6.8%, ≥4.4%, and ≥5.6%, respectively. In a phylogenetic tree based on the SSU and LSU rDNA, a clade containing this species belonged to a larger clade of the family Pfiesteriaceae, but was divergent from a clade containing K. glaucum. Due to its morphological similarity to K. glandulum and genetic differences from K. glaucum and the other species in the family Pfiesteriaceae, it is proposed that this species Aduncodinium glandula be assigned to be a new genus and a new combination, A. glandula. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Uncoupling of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) has been implicated in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and dilatory remodeling induced by pressure overload. We investigated whether administration of sepiapterin, a substrate of the salvage pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, prevents LVH and dilatory LV remodeling by inhibiting NOS uncoupling and increasing bioavailable NO. Pressure overload was induced in rats by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Concentric LVH developed during 8 wk after TAC, and dilatory LV remodeling and dysfunction developed between 8 and 16 wk after TAC associated with a decrease in capillary density. Oral administration of sepiapterin or the superoxide/peroxynitrite scavenger N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine for 8 wk after TAC inhibited oxidative stress, but only sepiapterin increased bioavailable NO and inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with a further increase in capillary density. When sepiapterin was administered between 8 and 16 wk after TAC, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was regressed and capillary density was restored. This was associated with the inhibition of interstitial fibrosis and dilatory LV remodeling. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abrogated all the beneficial effects of sepiapterin in rats with TAC. These results suggest that sepiapterin prevents concentric LVH and dilatory remodeling after TAC primarily by increasing the bioavailability of NO. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots on butterflywings have been shown to deter predators. This has been traditionally explained by mimicry of vertebrate eyes, but recently the classic eye-mimicry hypothesis has been challenged. It is proposed that the conspicuousness of the eyespot, not mimicry, is what causes aversion due to sensory biases, neophobia or sensory overloads.We conducted an experiment todirectly testwhether the eye-mimicry or the conspicuousness hypothesis better explain eyespot efficacy.We used great tits (Parusmajor) asmodel predator, and tested their reaction towards animated images on a computer display. Birds were tested against images of butterflies without eyespots, with natural-looking eyespots, and manipulated spots with the same contrast but reduced resemblance to an eye, as well as images of predators (owls) with and without eyes. We found that mimetic eyespots were as effective as true eyes of owls and more efficient in eliciting an aversive response than modified, less mimetic but equally contrasting eyespots. We conclude that the eye-mimicry hypothesis explains our results better than the conspicuousness hypothesis and is thus likely to be an important mechanism behind the evolution of butterfly eyespots. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Introduction: Muscle strength (MS) of the lower limbs is one of the main components required for specific actions during practice of 5-a-side football and when the levels are insufficient, elevated bilateral imbalances or marked difference in agonist/antagonist ratio (AAR) are factors that contribute to the development of musculoskeletal injuries. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess levels of peak torque, bilateral difference in force production and conventional ratio of flexor and extensor musculature of the knee in different speeds. Methods: The study included 11 visually impaired athletes. The athletes underwent anthropometric measurements to determine body composition and underwent evaluation at the isokinetic dynamometer to measure the levels of muscle imbalance and conventional ratio. Results: In concentric movements of the flexor muscles, significant differences were observed in peak torque (PT) between the dominant limb (DL) and non-dominant limb (NDL) at 60° .s-1 and 180°.s-1, the peak torque standardized (PTS) at 60°.s-1 and 180°.s-1 to the extensor muscles. In AAR, there was significant difference between DL and NDL, and acceptable levels of AAR in both legs according to the proposed for conventional football. Conclusion: It is expected that the results of this study may contribute to the processes of prevention, training and rehabilitation in athletes of 5-a-side football, also, serve as parameters for future studies. © 2015, Redprint Editora Ltda.

AB  - Integrated bioreactor called "Compact extended aeration reactor" (CEAR) was developed to perform biological wastewater treatment. Synthetic sample was used to imitate the municipal sewage during the experiment. The treatment units are integrated in series within a single concentric setup. The objective is to achieve wastewater treatment within a small footprint that can accomplish the stringent effluent discharge limits of nitrogen imposed in Malaysia. Conversely, to also realize a prospective target aimed at augmented profit margin for the developers, through leverage in extra space from land recovery. The recirculation of thickened activated sludge (RAS) from clarifier was carried out to maintain the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor and return of residual nitrate that could be discharged untreated. Internal recirculation (IR) was operated for the nitrate transfer to pre-anoxic chambers for the purpose of denitrification. This chapter covers removal efficiencies of organic matter, nitrogen and total suspended solids within a small footprint bioreactor. The benchmarking of the effluent discharge is according to Malaysia regulatory standards. The system of treatment process follows denitrification taking place both pre-anoxic and post-anoxic chambers, combined nitrification and organic removal in the aeration chamber, and clarifier settling the biomass prior to discharge. Sludge was wasted daily in order to maintain the solids retention time and avoiding excess growth of biomass in the system. The bioreactor used suspended growth process, extended aeration with longer solids retention time, and anoxic conditions to achieve the desired goals. This chapter also investigated the effectiveness of total nitrogen (TN) removal, by operating combinations of different IR ratios through variable influent nitrogen concentrations. The bioreactor effluent values have conformed to Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia's 2009 revised. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the development of ductile fuse system for steel angle bracings to reduce the seismic demand to the connections of concentrically braced frames. In such type of structure, the connections often need reinforcement to resist the tensile capacity of the bracing to comply with the capacity design procedure recommended by most design codes. In this research, various models of ductile fuses consisting of smoothly reduced angle section are placed on the X-bracing of a braced frame. The fuses are designed to reduce the tensile capacity of braced members to the capacity of the bolted connections. To evaluate the performance of the fuse system, two different thicknesses of single angle members with leg width of 64 mm part of an X-bracing are tested cyclically in a 1.75-m high frame representing a building story. It was observed that the braced frame with fuse could be used to reduce seismic load demand to the connections sufficiently to avoid connection strengthening that would result from the application of the capacity design principles. It was observed that properly designed fuse system in braced frame showed stable hysteretic response under cyclic loading and maintained adequate ductility with a reasonable compromise on the compressive strength of braced members. Finally, based on the study results, most efficient fuse patterns are identified for practical design applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Shock recovery techniques, such as the flyer-plate impact test, are used to examine a material that has been subjected to a single well-defined shock, followed by a single release wave. One of the key requirements of this type of technique is that the process should be such that any change found in the sample after recovery, can only be attributed to the shock process alone. Therefore, the principal problem for a test specimen-fixture assembly is that it is designed such that the loading history of the recovered specimen is known. This has motivated this research through the analysis led design of a shock recovery experiment. The choice of Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis for this design work was driven by the method's ability to accurately track history variables (for plastic deformation) and treat contact interactions which are crucial in this problem. Starting from an initial configuration, LS-Dyna has been used to analyse in detail the resulting wave propagation to ensure the generation of a uniaxial strain state in the specimen through Lagrangian distance-time diagrams. These iso-maps enabled the identification of potential shortcomings with the initial design, in terms of the transmission of contact and the influence of radial release waves at the different boundaries between specimen and supporting fixture rings. The benefits of using Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis for this design work are its ability to track history variables (for plastic deformation) and contact treatment. Based on these findings, a new configuration was developed, which consists of an array of concentric rings that support the specimen. During shock formation in the specimen, these rings progressively transfer the loading in the impact direction and radially away from the specimen, acting as momentum traps and preventing unwanted release waves from affecting the strain state experienced by the specimen. Comparing distance time diagrams between original and proposed configurations, a design sensitivity analysis was performed, where the new geometry resulted in a decrease of both the residual velocity (-38%) and radial displacement (-27%) of the target when compared to the original setup. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The web has become a vital global platform that binds together almost all daily activities like communication, sharing, and collaboration. Impersonators, phishers, scammers and spammers crop up all the time in Online Social Networks (OSNs), and are even harder to identify. People in the public eyes like politicians, celebrities, sports persons, media persons and other public figures with huge followings are particularly vulnerable to this type of attacks. The main objective in this work is to identify those forged users who harm genuine ones, jeopardize the identity and hence the security and privacy of users. In this paper a framework for the detection of malicious users, non-malicious users and celebrities has been developed by using an attribute set for user classification based on user characteristics. For the purpose of detecting malicious users, non-malicious users and celebrities, a crawler has been developed for Twitter and data of around 22K users have been collected from publicly available information. Data of around 7,500 users have been used for training and testing purpose in Weka for classification of users. 5 classifiers have been used and compared on the basis of performance metrics like precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy. RandomForest outperforms all the classifiers with 99.8% accuracy. Copyright 2014 ACM.

AB  - Annually, one in three seniors aged over 65 years fall. Balance and strength training can reduce neuromuscular fall risk factors and fall rates. Besides conventional balance and strength training, explosive or high-velocity strength training, eccentric exercises, perturbation-based balance training, trunk strength, and trunk control have also been emphasized. In contrast, aerobic exercise has to date not been included in fall-prevention studies. However, well-developed endurance capacity might attenuate fatigue-induced declines in postural control in sports-related or general activities of daily living. Physical performance indices, such as balance, strength, and endurance, are generally addressed independently in exercise guidelines. This approach seems time consuming and may impede integrative training of sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cardiocirculatory functions required to deal with balance-threatening situations in the elderly. An agility-based conceptual training framework comprising perception and decision making (e.g., visual scanning, pattern recognition, anticipation) and changes of direction (e.g., sudden starts, stops and turns; reactive control; concentric and eccentric contractions) might enable an integrative neuromuscular, cardiocirculatory, and cognitive training. The present paper aims to provide a scientific sketch of how to build such an integrated modular training approach, allowing adaptation of intensity, complexity, and cognitive challenge of the agility tasks to the participant’s capacity. Subsequent research should address the (1) link between agility and fall risk factors as well as fall rates, (2) benefit–risk ratios of the proposed approach, (3) psychosocial aspects of agility training (e.g., motivation), and (4) logistical requirements (e.g., equipment needed). © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The root system, crown, and lower stems of a wheat plant are unique habitats for microorganisms attacking those organs, unique because the pathogens complete at least part of their life cycle in intimate contact with the soil. Many control recommendations for diseases of roots, crowns, and lower stems are effective either directly or indirectly as a result of the activity of the resident microflora. The wheat pathogens cause the following diseases: common root and crown rot, Pythium root rot, take-all, Rhi-zoctonia root rot and sharp eyespot, strawbreaker foot rot, and Cepha-losporium stripe. Members of the first group include those that cause the diseases Rhizoctonia root rot, Pythium root rot, common root and crown rot, as well as root-lesion nematodes and stubby-root nematodes. Economic control of diseases of roots, crowns, and lower stems of wheat usually results when several control procedures are integrated into a grower's production scheme. © 1987 ASA-CSSA-SSSA.

AB  - The Boeing Company is striving to improve quality and reduce defects and injuries through the implementation of lightweight “Right Sized” automated drill and fasten equipment. This has lead to the factory adopting Boeing developed and supplier built flex track drill and countersink machines for drilling fuselage circumferential joins, wing panel to spar and wing splice stringers. The natural evolution of this technology is the addition of fastener installation to enable One Up Assembly. The critical component of One Up Assembly is keeping the joint squeezed tightly together to prevent burrs and debris at the interface. Traditionally this is done by two-sided machines providing concentric clamp up around the hole while it is being drilled. It was proposed that for stiff structure, the joint could be held together by beginning adjacent to a tack fastener, and assemble the joint sequentially using the adjacent hole clamp up from the previous hole to keep the joint clamped up. This process would significantly decrease the costs and complexity that is usually associated with two sided equipment involved in One Up drilling and fastening. This paper will examine the equipment and testing completed to prove out the process of using adjacent hole clamp up to achieve One Up Assembly. Copyright © 2014 SAE International.

AB  - Playing field hockey, similar to soccer, has an impact on various physical attributes, including muscle strength, which is a major factor in balance. The objective of this study was to analyze the correlation of static (SI) and dynamic (TCT) balance and isokinetic strength (PT/BW and WK/BW) of the ankle joint by playing position for elite female field hockey players. The static and dynamic balance of forwards was closely related to isokinetic strength of evertors and dorsi flexors concentrically and eccentrically, and the dynamic balance of midfielders was closely related to isokinetic strength of dorsi flexors concentrically and eccentrically. Our results indicate that the balance of hockey players correlates with isokinetic strengths of the ankle and the type of contraction, depending on the players' position. Therefore, a training protocol for improving balance ability to improve athletic performance and prevent ankle joint injuries should include isokinetic strengthening exercises for the ankle joint, based on the playing position in the field.

AB  - Location-based Social Discovery (LBSD) services enable users to discover their geographic neighborhoods to make new friends. Original LBSD services were designed to provide the exact distances to nearby users. It has been shown that it is easy to pinpoint any target user's location by using trilateration based on the exact distances from three fake GPS locations to the target user. To thwart the trilateration attack, contemporary LBSD services then began to report distances of nearby users in concentric bands, e.g., bands of 100 meters. In this paper, we investigate the user location privacy leakage problem in LBSD services reporting distances in discrete bands. Using number theory, we analytically show that by strategically placing multiple virtual probes with contrived fake GPS locations, one can nevertheless pinpoint user locations in band-based LBSD. Our methodology guarantees to pinpoint any reported user within an area bounded by one square meter, even for LBSD services using large bands (such as 100m as used by WeChat). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly exploits and quantifies user location privacy leakage in band-based LBSD services. Our study is expected to draw more public attention to this serious privacy issue and hopefully motivate better privacy-preserving LBSD designs. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns are highly complex and diverse, but they are believed to be derived from the nymphalid groundplan, which is composed of several color pattern systems. Among these pattern systems, the marginal band system, including marginal and submarginal bands, has rarely been studied. Here, we examined the color pattern diversity of the marginal band system among nymphalid butterflies. Marginal and submarginal bands are usually expressed as a pair of linear bands aligned with the wing margin. However, a submarginal band can be expressed as a broken band, an elongated oval, or a single dot. The marginal focus, usually a white dot at the middle of a wing compartment along the wing edge, corresponds to the pupal edge spot, one of the pupal cuticle spots that signify the locations of color pattern organizing centers. A marginal band can be expressed as a semicircle, an elongated oval, or a pair of eyespot-like structures, which suggest the organizing activity of the marginal focus. Physical damage at the pupal edge spot leads to distal dislocation of the submarginal band in Junonia almana and in Vanessa indica, suggesting that the marginal focus functions as an organizing center for the marginal band system. Taken together, we conclude that the marginal band system is developmentally equivalent to other symmetry systems. Additionally, the marginal band is likely a core element and the submarginal band a paracore element of the marginal band system, and both bands are primarily specified by the marginal focus organizing center. © 2015 Zoological Society of Japan

AB  - This paper presents design and testing of a shell-encapsulated solar collector which can be used in north area of China for wall-amounting installation. The designed solar collector is based on the combination of a novel compound curved surface concentrator and an aluminum concentric solar receiver, which is contained in a glass evacuated-tube. As there is no perforative joint between the double-skin glass evacuated-tube and the aluminum concentric solar receiver, the difficulty of vacuum keeping for a glass-metal joint is avoided. The cavity shell provides an additional thermal insulation to reduce heat loss of the designed solar collector. The working principle of the compound curved surface concentrator is described. The ray-tracing results are given to show the effect of deviation angle of the concentrator on its optical efficiency, hence determining its maximum acceptance angle. A prototype of the designed solar collector has been constructed and tested under the sunny winter weather condition. The experimental results indicate that the hot water temperature higher than 80°C with a daily average efficiency of about 45∼50% has been achieved at the average ambient temperature below 0°C, so the designed solar collector can produce hot water at a useful temperature in winter. © 2015 Hongfei Zheng et al.

AB  - The article discusses evolutionary aspects of mimicry from a semiotic viewpoint. The concept of semiotic scaffolding is used for this approach, and its relations with the concepts of exaptation and semiotic co-option are explained. Different dimensions of scaffolding are brought out as ontogenetic, evolutionary, physiological and cognitive. These dimensions allow for interpreting mimicry as a system that scaffolds itself. With the help of a number of mimicry cases, e.g. butterfly eyespots, brood parasitism, and plant mimesis, the evolutionary dynamics of mimicry in the open bio-semiosphere is investigated. The main argument is that biological mimicry largely develops through sign relations and communicative relations between organisms. It is proposed that mimicry systems should be described as two-layered structures composed of the ecological composition of the species involved and the semiotic structure of their communication. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - An approach for coordination and control of 3D heterogeneous formations of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles under hawk-eye-like relative localization is presented in this paper. The core of the method lies in the use of visual top-view feedback from flying robots for the stabilization of the entire group in a leader-follower formation. We formulate a novel model predictive control-based methodology for guiding the formation. The method is employed to solve the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader into a desired target region. In addition, the method is used for keeping the following vehicles in the desired shape of the group. The approach is designed to ensure direct visibility between aerial and ground vehicles, which is crucial for the formation stabilization using the hawk-eye-like approach. The presented system is verified in numerous experiments inspired by search-and-rescue applications, where the formation acts as a searching phalanx. In addition, stability and convergence analyses are provided to explicitly determine the limitations of the method in real-world applications. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In modern biology, the appearance of organisms is largely understood as an adaptation serving the survival function. Here we advance a biosemiotic perspective inspired by the works of Adolf Portmann and Jakob von Uexküll. From this perspective, the visual dimension of every living being can be understood as a representation of the evolutionary experience of a species. In the study of animal displays, biosemiotics focuses on the qualitative perspective in both the logic behind the emergence of such signs as well as their perception and interpretation by perceiving animals. In this study, we claim that convergence of the animal surface patterns that stem developmentally from different ontogenetic precursors should be taken as evidence for congruence in biological meaning. As a specific example, the article discusses the development, perception, and evolution of semantic organs such as eyespots on butterfly wings and vertebrate eyes. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This study focuses on sedimentary structures formed by microbial consortia, in a particular coastal setting, an ancient tidal channel, separated from the ocean by a sandy spit and connected by a blind tidal channel at the opposite end. Most studies in modern and ancient environments consider water movement as the triggering mechanism acting in the formation and deformation of sedimentary structures. As such, the paper documents the presence of several microbial structures such as shrinkage cracks, flip-over mats, microbial chips, and multidirectional ripples which are related to tidal processes, while bulges and gas domes structures are formed after occasional inundation events. However, the more conspicuous structures covering a great area at the study site are folds and roll-ups, the product of deformation of microbially induced structures by the action of sporadic spring-tidal currents due to strong winds. Therefore, the objective of this research is to document modern sedimentary structures in a coastal area and to provide a mechanistic explanation for their formation, based on the interplaying effects of the moisture variation and high shear stress. Also, several microbial sedimentary structures are distinguished throughout vertical sediment cores, such as microbial chips, detached mat, sponge fabrics, tears, and concentric structures, which are identified in a sedimentary profile. Through the recognition and interpretation of modern sedimentary deformation structures, this study contributes empirical tools for the reconstruction of analogous paleoenvironments in fossil studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines selected artworks produced by Malayan artists of Chinese descent during the 1950s and 1960s within the contexts of Malayan nationalism and cultural identity. Local art historical writing frequently discusses their works as individualistic journeys in art, detached from nationalistic discourse and derivative of Western artistic movements. By employing the notions of hybridity to re-examine their works, this paper argues that this misleading view of their works is based on essentialist and static conceptions of Malayan culture. In contrast, this paper demonstrates how the artists employed non-essentialist concepts of identity based on otherness rather than similarity, to construct a criterion for authenticity and belonging. It emphasises the agency of the artists as active participants in the making of the new Malayan nation state within the field of art. It posits their works collectively as expressions of hybridity as strategy for Malayan nationalism. Subsequently, the notion of hybridity enables the viewing of cultural exchanges and borrowings in art within a horizontal model of cultural development rather than a concentric one which privileges Western culture or Chinese culture at the centre. This research employs a qualitative research methodology based on primary and secondary resources. This includes semi-structured interviews, first-hand viewing of artworks at art galleries, state-owned museums and private collections; archival research and secondary sources such as books, exhibition catalogues, newspapers, journal articles and unpublished dissertations. The theoretical framework is interdisciplinary in approach, supplementing art historical methods with those from cultural studies. This approach is in line with methods of "the new art history" which avoids purely formalistic analysis and emphasises the importance of contextual analysis. This paper contributes not only to the writing and analysis of Malaysian modern art but may be viewed comparatively to other Southeast Asian modern art histories who share similarities in their employment of Western modern art and their search for a legitimate national cultural identity. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the identity links as enunciated in the Historia antigua de M&#233;xico (1780), written by the Novohispano Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787). Facing the degrading European theses which, during the mid-18th century, had tried to justify the inferiority of the population of the Americas, Clavijero built his defense for the people of the valley of Anahuac not only from a strictly criollo and Americanist position, but also from a Hispanic one, born from a sense of belonging to an imperial reality and a Catholic intellectual tradition. Triggered by the Enlightenment&#39;s attacks toward Catolicism and Hispanice culture, Clavijero strengthened his identification with the Spanish imperial reality in order to build his defense.

AB  - Serial homologues are repeated traits that share similar development but occur in different parts of the body. Variation in number of repeats accounts for substantial diversity in animal form and considerable work has focused on identifying the factors accounting for this variation. Little is known, however, about how serial homologues originally become repeated, or about the relative timing of repeat individuation relative to repeat origin. Here, we show that the serially repeated eyespots on nymphalid butterfly wings most likely arose as a small cluster of units on the ventral hindwing that were later co-opted to the dorsal and anterior wing surfaces. Based on comparative analyses of over 400 species, we found support for a model of eyespot origin followed by redeployment, rather than by the conventional model, where eyespots arose as a complete row of undifferentiated units that later gained individuation. In addition, eyespots most likely evolved from simpler pattern elements, single-coloured spots, which were already individuated among different wing sectors. Finally, the late appearance of eyespots on the dorsal, hidden wing surface further suggests that these novel complex traits originally evolved for one function (thwarting predator attacks) and acquired a second function (sexual signalling) when moved to a different body location. This broad comparative analysis illustrates how serial homologues may initially evolve as a few units serving a particular function and subsequently become repeated in novel body locations with new functions. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Alike the little mouse of the Gruffalo’s tale, many harmless preys use intimidating deceptive signals as anti-predator strategies. For example, several caterpillars display eyespots and face-like colour patterns that are thought to mimic the face of snakes as deterrents to insectivorous birds. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the hypothesis that these defensive strategies exploit adaptive cognitive biases of birds, which make them much more likely to confound caterpillars with snakes than vice versa. By focusing on the information- processing mechanisms of decision-making, the model assumes that, during prey assessment, the bird accumulates noisy evidence supporting either the snake-escape or the caterpillar-attack motor responses, which compete against each other for execution. Competition terminates when the evidence for either one of the responses reaches a critical threshold. This model predicts a strong asymmetry and a strong negative correlation between the prey- and the predator-decision thresholds, which increase with the increasing risk of snake predation and assessment uncertainty. The threshold asymmetry causes an asymmetric distribution of false-negative and false-positive errors in the snake–caterpillar decision plane, which makes birds much more likely to be deceived by the intimidating signals of snake-mimicking caterpillars than by the alluring signals of caterpillar-mimicking snakes. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Bilateral asymmetries and muscle imbalances are associated with increased risk for lower limb injuries and still seem to imply in athletes performance. This study aimed to analyze bilateral asymmetry of soccer players in age category below 20 years old (peak torque and conventional and functional reason in extensor/flexors of knee and inverter/ eversion of ankle) and to compare these variables between defending, midfield and attacker players. The study included 22 athletes in age category below 20, which underwent a five maximal isokinetic testing with repetitions at 180°/s for knee and 120°/s for ankle, both concentric and eccentric actions. T test for dependent data was used to compare values of torque between dominant and non-dominant limbs and one-way ANOVA was used to compare neuromuscular variables between players of different positions, both at p <0.05. No significant differences were observed in any neuromuscular variable (peak torque and functional and conventional ratio) between dominant and non-dominant sides (p> 0.05). It was found that defensive players had eccentric torque values of extensors knee higher than midfield players (p <0.05). Defensive players exhibit greater eccentric torque of knee extensor muscles compared to midfield players. It can be concluded that the analyzed soccer players did not present bilateral asymmetries in flexor/extensor knee muscles neither in inverter/eversion ankle muscles. © 2015, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

AB  - The article deals with the issues of the strengthening and stabilisation of stone masonry columns reinforced by fabrics based on inorganic fibres under concentric compression. These structures represent a frequent design solution of load-bearing structures of historic buildings. High-strength carbon fibres fabric placed along the perimeter of a masonry column—in thirds of the column height—prevents the undesirable redistribution of compressive normal stresses along the compressed element’s cross section in the phase of crack propagation and crack development. In this phase, despite growing horizontal and vertical deformations (mainly in the central part), a masonry element is able to transfer the growing compressive load. In this case, a gradual exhaustion of the ultimate strength of the individual masonry components occurs as a consequence of wrapping in a composite based on high-strength fibres. The experimental research of the failure mechanism of stone columns made of coursed masonry of regular sandstone blocks and coursed masonry of irregular (freestone) blocks under concentric compression and the research of the performance of non-reinforced as well as CFRP-reinforced stone columns completed to-date reveals the necessity of a different approach to the assessment of the load-bearing capacity, or residual load-bearing capacity, of masonry composed of stone blocks. © 2014, RILEM.

AB  - With the popularity of smart phones nowadays, image retrieval on mobile devices has been applied on a wider scale. To balance the efficiency and performance, an image retrieval algorithm which consists of two matching steps is proposed for furniture images captured by mobile devices (named mobile images). In the first stage, similar images are quickly obtained by the rough matching algorithm based on the bag-of-words (BOW) method. In the second stage, the most similar image is selected from the selection of similar images using the fine matching algorithm based on ORiented Brief (ORB).There are four main contributions in this paper. Firstly, add a spatial relationship to BOW features, an image is divided into three circular parts: the inner, middle and outer parts. Secondly, a feature point extraction method on concentric circles is proposed, which are resistant to geometric attack. Thirdly, the Gabor local line-based feature (GALIF) descriptor is improved by changing the filter object from the line to areas and overcome its weakness of low efficiency and rotation-sensitivity. Finally, a new image signature matching strategy is proposed based on Euclidean distance and a scale invariant feature to improve matching accuracy. Experimental results on a database with thousands of images show that our algorithm can retrieve mobile images quickly and precisely. © 2016.

AB  - Background: The Kalligrammatidae are distinctive, large, conspicuous, lacewings found in Eurasia from the Middle Jurassic to mid Early Cretaceous. Because of incomplete and often inadequate fossil preservation, an absence of detailed morphology, unclear relationships, and unknown evolutionary trends, the Kalligrammatidae are poorly understood. Results: We describe three new subfamilies, four new genera, twelve new species and four unassigned species from the late Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan and mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formations of China. These kalligrammatid taxa exhibit diverse morphological characters, such as mandibulate mouthparts in one major clade and siphonate mouthparts in the remaining four major clades, the presence or absence of a variety of distinctive wing markings such as stripes, wing spots and eyespots, as well as multiple major wing shapes. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the Kalligrammatidae are divided into five principal clades: Kalligrammatinae Handlirsch, 1906, Kallihemerobiinae Ren & Engel, 2008, Meioneurinae subfam. nov., Oregrammatinae subfam. nov. and Sophogrammatinae subfam. nov., each of which is accorded subfamily-level status. Our results show significant morphological and evolutionary differentiation of the Kalligrammatidae family during a 40 million-year-interval of the mid Mesozoic. Conclusion: A new phylogeny and classification of five subfamilies and their constituent genera is proposed for the Kalligrammatidae. These diverse, yet highly specialized taxa from northeastern China suggest that eastern Eurasia likely was an important diversification center for the Kalligrammatidae. Kalligrammatids possess an extraordinary morphological breadth and panoply of adaptations during the mid-Mesozoic that highlight our conclusion that their evolutionary biology is much more complex than heretofore realized. © 2014 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A ceramic membrane reactor was investigated for the continuous catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with oxygen. The reactor had a concentric configuration. An inner tube created an annulus for the catalyst packed-bed (0.9 wt % Au-Pd/TiO2, particle size 90-125 μm) through which the liquid phase (benzyl alcohol, neat or dissolved in o-xylene) flowed. This was followed by the tubular ceramic membrane, which consisted of layers of alumina and a zirconia top layer with a nominal average pore size of 50 nm. The role of the membrane was to provide an interface for gas and liquid to come in contact. Pure oxygen was fed to the opposite side of the membrane in the outer shell of the reactor. Temperature affected conversion but not selectivity, possibly because of insufficient supply of oxygen. However, increasing catalyst contact time or decreasing benzyl alcohol concentration improved selectivity and conversion, indicating that a key parameter was the balance between oxygen supply by the membrane vs oxygen demand by the reaction. By adjusting the operating parameters, reaction performance improved. Selectivity to benzaldehyde 88% and conversion of benzyl alcohol 75% were obtained at 3.2 bara of gas pressure, 24444 gcat·s/galcohol catalyst contact time, 0.5 M benzyl alcohol concentration, and temperature of 120 °C. This performance was comparable to simulated trickle bed operation, where oxygen and substrate were premixed before entering the catalyst packed bed. The membrane reactor offers safer operation, since flammable oxygen/organic mixtures formed in the trickle bed are avoided. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Previous studies have utilized screening values of 10-15% of lower-extremity side-to-side strength asymmetry in soccer players with conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in screening values for side-to-side asymmetry in soccer players according to their playing position, as well as to compare the differences in strength asymmetry between particular playing positions. Seventy-nine Brazilian male professional soccer players (age 26.1±5.3 years; body mass 79.8±14.4 kg; body height 180.4±12.9 cm) were grouped into playing positions of: goalkeepers, side backs, central backs, central defending midfielders, central attacking midfielders, and forwards. They performed maximal knee extension and flexion concentric and knee flexion eccentric actions on their preferred and non-preferred legs at 1.047 rad·s-1. Forwards and goalkeepers had hamstrings concentric peak torque asymmetry (18.0±9.9%) and eccentric peak torque asymmetry (20.1±10.7%) significantly greater than 10% (p<.05). All other playing positions had values less than 15%. Our results indicate that the use of either 10 or 15% asymmetry cut off may result in different conclusions, which may affect decision-making regarding strength ratios. Furthermore, if 10% is used as a screening value, hamstrings strengthening programs based on bilateral equivalency should be prescribed for goalkeepers and forwards to reduce asymmetry. © 2015, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

AB  - An approach for automatically correcting the eccentricity of the die to the punch with a moving die in small clearance punching of die-quenched steel sheets having low ductility was developed to improve the quality of the sheared edge and tool life. Although small clearance punching has the advantage of high quality of sheared edges for high strength steel sheets, it is not easy to set the die and punch for the small clearance concentrically. This brings about deterioration of the quality of the sheared edges and failure of the tools. In automatic centring, the position of the moving die is corrected by an imbalanced force during punching. It was found that small clearance punching with automatic centring is effective for not only the improvement of surface quality of the sheared edge but also the prevention of tool failure and delayed fracture in cold punching of die-quenched steel sheets having 1500 MPa in tensile strength. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a neuromuscular training program combining eccentric hamstring muscle strength, plyometrics, and free/resisted sprinting exercises on knee extensor/flexor muscle strength, sprinting performance, and horizontal mechanical properties of sprint running in football (soccer) players. Sixty footballers were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). Twenty-seven players completed the EG and 24 players the CG. Both groups performed regular football training while the EG performed also a neuromuscular training during a 7-week period. The EG showed a small increases in concentric quadriceps strength (ES=0.38/0.58), a moderate to large increase in concentric (ES=0.70/0.74) and eccentric (ES=0.66/0.87) hamstring strength, and a small improvement in 5-m sprint performance (ES=0.32). By contrast, the CG presented lower magnitude changes in quadriceps (ES=0.04/0.29) and hamstring (ES=0.27/0.34) concentric muscle strength and no changes in hamstring eccentric muscle strength (ES=-0.02/0.11). Thus, in contrast to the CG (ES=-0.27/0.14), the EG showed an almost certain increase in the hamstring/quadriceps strength functional ratio (ES=0.32/0.75). Moreover, the CG showed small magnitude impairments in sprinting performance (ES=-0.35/-0.11). Horizontal mechanical properties of sprint running remained typically unchanged in both groups. These results indicate that a neuromuscular training program can induce positive hamstring strength and maintain sprinting performance, which might help in preventing hamstring strains in football players. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Circular markings, called eyespots, on the wings of Lepidoptera have been shown to be protective against predators. We tested the 'conspicuousness-hypothesis' and 'eye mimicry-hypothesis' by examining how 'sparkle' and colour pattern of eyespots deter predators. The rationale was to test the deterring effect of shape and colour pattern of the eyespots' elements that are assumed to mimic lens eyes, namely iris, pupil, and sparkle by simultaneous exposure of lepidopteran dummies with equally conspicuous eyespots that differed in their similarity to lens eyes. The results provide evidence that circular and crescent-shaped 'sparkles' were more deterring than rectangular-shaped 'sparkles'. The 'sparkle's' UV-reflection had no effect on the deterrence. Our results support recent findings on the deterrent effect of the eyespot's 'sparkle' and show that colour is less important for deterrence. The characteristic colour pattern of eyespots and illusion of three-dimensionality created by the 'sparkle' might contribute to the deterrent effect. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.

AB  - It has long been believed that the paired circular markings ("eyespots") of Lepidoptera larvae, combined with their defensive postures (where the larvae swell their anterior body segments) protect them from potential predators. These traits could inhibit attacks by enhancing the similarity of the prey item to the predator's own natural enemies (notably snakes), but alternatively, they may simply exploit the predator's wariness of novel and/or conspicuous objects. To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey. In the first experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either without eyespots or with eyespots positioned in 1 of 2 locations on their bodies: anteriorly or centrally. In the second experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either lacking the thickening associated with the defensive posture, or with models in which a thickened section was placed centrally or anteriorly. In both cases, the chicks were significantly more wary of prey with anteriorly positioned defensive traits than either prey without these traits or prey with centrally positioned traits. Because prey with central eyespots and central thickening were equally novel and conspicuousness to those with these traits positioned in a more head-like anterior position, we infer that predator wariness was primarily influenced by the similarity of the prey to their potential natural enemies. These results support the idea that both caterpillar eyespots, and the defensive posture examined here, deter predators not simply because they are conspicuous, but because they enhance caterpillars' resemblance to potentially dangerous vertebrates. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

AB  - Previous investigators have proposed that knee strength, hamstrings to quadriceps, and side-to-side asymmetries may vary according to soccer field positions. However, different results have been found in these variables, and a generalization of this topic could lead to data misinterpretation by coaches and soccer clubs. Thus, the aim of this study was to measure knee strength and asymmetry in soccer players across different field positions. One hundred and two male professional soccer players performed maximal concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee actions on the preferred and nonpreferred legs at a velocity of 60°·s -1. Players were divided into their field positions for analysis: goalkeepers, side backs, central backs, central defender midfielders, central attacking midfielders, and forwards. Results demonstrated that only goalkeepers (GK) differed from most other field positions on players' characteristics, and concentric peak torque across muscles. Although all players presented functional ratios of the preferred (0.79 ± 0.14) and nonpreferred (0.75 ± 0.13) legs below accepted normative values, there were no differences between positions for conventional or functional strength ratios or side-to-side asymmetry. The same comparisons were made only between field players, without inclusion of the GK, and no differences were found between positions. Therefore, the hamstrings to quadriceps and side-to-side asymmetries found here may reflect knee strength functional balance required for soccer skills performance and game demands across field positions. These results also suggest that isokinetic strength profiles should be considered differently in GK compared with other field positions due to their specific physiological and training characteristics. © 2015 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - Many caterpillars have conspicuous eye-like markings, called eyespots. Despite recent work demonstrating the efficacy of eyespots in deterring predator attack, a fundamental question remains: Given their protective benefits, why have eyespots not evolved in more caterpillars? Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars, we show that eyespots are associated with large body size. This relationship could arise because (i) large prey are innately conspicuous; (ii) large prey are more profitable, and thus face stronger selection to evolve such defenses; and/or (iii) eyespots are more effective on large-bodied prey. To evaluate these hypotheses, we exposed small and large caterpillar models with and without eyespots in a 2 x 2 factorial design to avian predators in the field. Overall, eyespots increased prey mortality, but the effect was particularly marked in small prey, and eyespots decreased mortality of large prey in some microhabitats. We then exposed artificial prey to naïve domestic chicks in a laboratory setting following a 2 x 3 design (small or large size x no, small, or large eyespots). Predators attacked small prey with eyespots more quickly, but were more wary of large caterpillars with large eyespots than those without eyespots or with small eyespots. Taken together, these data suggest that eyespots are effective deterrents only when both prey and eyespots are large, and that innate aversion toward eyespots is conditional. We conclude that the distribution of eyespots in nature likely results from selection against eyespots in small caterpillars and selection for eyespots in large caterpillars (at least in some microhabitats). © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the profile of muscular strength and strength asymmetries of national female soccer players (n = 17, age = 24.19 ± 3.66 years, body height = 168.37 ± 6.76 cm, body mass = 62.13 ± 6.05 kg).The muscular strength of the lower limbs was assessed using a Cybex Humac Norm isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex NORM ®, Humac, CA, USA). The maximum peak muscle torque of the knee extensors (PTE) and flexors (PTF) of the preferred (PL) and non-preferred leg (NL) during concentric contraction were measured at three angular velocities of movement (60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 °·s-1). Muscle strength of PTE and PTF significantly decreased with increasing angular velocity (p<0.01). The female players produced insignificant muscle strength differences between the PL and NL at all angular velocities. The difference between PTE and PTF was ~ 43.2% at the lowest velocity and ~ 32.8% at the highest velocity. Speed of muscle contraction had a significant effect on the ipsilateral ratio (H:Q ratio) in female players (PL: F1.69,25.8 = 7.61, p = 0.00, η2= 0.32, NL: F2.37,37.9 = 14.50, p = 0.00, η2= 0.48). Concerning the Q:Q ratio, contraction velocity only insignificantly affected its size F2.79,44.6 = 0.38, p = 0.82, η2= 0.02. The bilateral ratio of knee flexors (H:H) did not significantly change under the contraction velocity (F4,64 = 2.86, p = 0.03, η2= 0.15). The comparison of bilateral ratio of knee extensors vs. knee flexors was significant (p<0.01) at the velocities of 180, 240 and 300 °·s-1. It appears that the bilateral ratio of knee extensors is stable with respect to speed of muscle contraction while the ratio of knee flexors is sensitive to increasing movement velocity above 180°·s-1. Our study indicated that almost 50% of female players have at least one strength asymmetry (bilateral knee flexor) regardless of their limb’s preferences. Maladaptive effects in terms of different kinds of body strength asymmetries represent a potential risk of a player’s injury; therefore the detected asymmetries should be systematically monitored and compensated using specific exercises. © 2015, Univerzitet u Travniku.

AB  - Methods. The model was established for two cities (Obihiro and Sapporo) in Hokkaido, Japan, in which a sylvatic cycle of E. multilocularis is maintained. The two cities have different degrees of urbanization. The modeling process was designed to detect the best combination of key environmental factors and spatial scale that foxes pay attention to most (here named 'heeding range') when they select den sites. All possible models were generated using logistic regression analysis, with "presence" or "absence" of fox den as the objective variable, and nine landscape categories customized for urban environments as predictor variables to detect the best subset of predictors. This procedure was conducted for each of ten sizes of concentric circles from dens and control points to detect the best circle size. Out of all models generated, the most parsimonious model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) inspection.; Background: Deworming wild foxes by baiting with the anthelmintic praziquantel is being established as a preventive technique against environmental contamination with Echinococcus multilocularis eggs. Improvement of the cost-benefit performance of baiting treatment is required urgently to raise and maintain the efficacy of deworming. We established a spatial model of den site selection by urban red foxes, the definitive host, to specify the optimal micro-habitats for delivering baits in a new modeling approach modified for urban fox populations.; Results: Our models suggest that fox dens in Obihiro are located at the center of a circle with 500 m radius including low percentages of wide roads, narrow roads, and occupied buildings, but high percentages of green covered areas; the dens in Sapporo within 300 m radius with low percentages of wide roads, occupied buildings, but high percentages of riverbeds and green covered areas. The variation of the models suggests the necessity of accumulating models for various types of cities in order to reveal the patterns of the model.; Conclusions: Our denning models indicating suitable sites for delivering baits will improve the cost-benefit performance of the campaign. Our modeling protocol is suitable for the urban landscapes, and for extracting the heeding range when they select the den sites. © 2014 Ikeda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - As revealed in the composer's preface to Night's Black Bird (2004), this twelve-minute work for full orchestra begins and ends in the same manner as its closely related, thirty-minute long predecessor, The Shadow of Night (2001): both pieces dwell in and move through the ‘same territory’ but take ‘slightly different paths’. Exploring the issue of sameness, at least at the beginning and end of a journey, is rather compelling in Birtwistle's case, as his particular brand of sameness is certainly not one of literal repetition. Indeed, Birtwistle has claimed that he is ‘concerned with repetition’: ‘I move in circles; more precisely I move in concentric circles.’ The general concept of motion in concentric circles, however, is not associated with a destination, nor necessarily with a direction, but with retracing steps along the way at an implied distance from the point of origin, like ripples on the surface of a pond. While the concept of a journey may imply linear and goal-oriented narratives, journeying in concentric circles entails more than just a sense of repetition. Accordingly, at Birtwistle's insistence, Night's Black Bird was programmed before The Shadow of Night, suggesting that ‘in the circular time world, a memory may also be a premonition’. This slight difference of paths is amplified over the course of time, as the latter work lasts approximately half as long as its predecessor. The path the later work takes thus seems representative of a shorter, more direct route. To explore these ideas in more detail, the first part of this chapter presents a comparative analysis of the opening passages of both orchestral works, exploring concepts of sameness and repetition and the musical schemas that engender them. The second part of the chapter takes as its cue one outstanding feature from each work – layered ostinato in The Shadow of Night, and an emerging melody in Night's Black Bird – and expands the inquiry to concepts of repetition and sameness by addressing processes of ostinato, repetition, melody and variation as they unfold in the piano miniature Ostinato with Melody (2000). © Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - Typically, an automatic face authentication (FA) procedure begins with data (facial images) acquisition, procedure that can be carried out with or without human monitoring (in unconstrained settings), the subsequent steps being automatically processed. When the human monitoring is absent for the access procedure (i.e., the system is operating in the “wild”), the current FA systems can be easily cheated by spoofing identities using photographs or recorded video playback containing genuine information. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to indicating potential spoof attacks when a video recording of a genuine user is playback in front of a FA system. The approach relies on detecting specific image artifacts, more precisely oscillating patterns. Smooth image areas are first identified in the pixel domain as containing potential oscillating-like patterns. Several image statistics are next extracted and corresponding feature vectors are formed. Eventually, these feature vectors are classified as real or attack feature vectors by means of Lagrangian Support Vector Machines (LSVMs). When compared to two state-of-the-art methods, namely local binary patterns (LBP) and concentric Fourier based features, the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms the two for this particular type of video data. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A recent Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star HL Tau. We consider the hypothesis that these gaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding the dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing estimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated constraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation of new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such systems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets, we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass of Saturn. The inner two planets' masses are unconstrained by dynamical stability arguments. © 2015.

AB  - In order to know whether principal stress orientations in the source area rotated after the 2011 April 11 Mw 6.6 Fukushima-Hamadori earthquake in NE Japan, we investigated detailed spatial distributions of stress orientations for both the pre- A nd post-main shock periods using a large amount of focal mechanism data. We applied stress tensor inversions to focal mechanism data from Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention's F-net broadband seismic network and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The σ3-axes estimated for the pre-main shock period are predominantly oriented WSW-ENE, and are relatively homogeneously in space. In contrast, the orientations of the σ3-axes show a significantly heterogeneous distribution in space for the post-main shock period. In the northern subarea of the focal region, the σ3-axes are oriented NW-SE. In the east and west portions of the central subarea, they are oriented NNW-SSE and WNW-ESE, respectively, almost perpendicular to each other. In the southern subarea, the σ3-axes are oriented WSW-ENE. On the whole, the σ3-axis orientations show concentric circle-like distribution surrounding the large slip area of the MwMw 6.6 main shock rupture. The change of principal stress axis orientations after the earthquake is not significant because of the sparse data set for the pre-main shock period. We calculated static stress changes from the Mw 6.6 main shock and three Mw > 5.5 earthquakes to compare with the observed stress axis orientations in the post-main shock period. The σ3-axis orientations of the calculated total static stress change show a concentric circle-like distribution surrounding the large slip area of the main shock, similar to that noted above. This observation strongly suggests that the spatially heterogeneous stress orientations in the post-main shock period were caused by the static stress change from the Mw 6.6 main shock and other large earthquakes. In order to estimate the differential stress magnitude in the focal area, we calculated deviatoric stress tensors in the post-main shock period by assuming that they are the sum of the deviatoric stress tensors in the pre-main shock period and the static stress changes. Comparison of the calculated and observed stress tensors revealed differential stress magnitudes of 2-30 MPa that explain the observed stress orientations, considering the probable range of estimated stress ratios in the pre-main shock period.  © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Self-centering concentrically braced frame (SC-CBF) systems have been developed to increase the drift capacity of braced frame systems prior to damage. The SC-CBF has a column base detail that permits column uplift at a specified level of overturning moment resulting from lateral forces, softening the lateral force-lateral drift behavior of the system. Restoring forces from vertically-oriented posttensioning bars provides self-centering and reduces residual drift in the SC-CBF. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-CBF systems, a comparative study of seismic performance of SC-CBF systems with that of conventional CBF systems is performed using seismic fragility and engineering demand (e.g., peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift) hazard curves. First, two prototype buildings are designed with the same configuration, with either CBF or SC-CBF frames as the lateral-load-resisting system. Then both structures are analyzed using nonlinear time history finite element modeling under earthquake records that have various seismic characteristics. The seismic responses are then utilized to build accurate probabilistic demand models for peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift. Finally, fragility curves for three performance levels (immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention) and engineering demand hazard curves are generated using the developed probabilistic demand models. The comparison of the fragilities and engineering demand hazard curves of the two structural systems reveals that the SC-CBF system exhibits better seismic performance than the conventional CBF system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Peacock spot is also known as olive leaf spot or bird's eye spot and it is caused by a fungus: Spilocaea oleagina. This very common disease occurs throughout olive-growing regions. Cultivars vary in their susceptibility, but all are subject to infection. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the disease may take several years to become serious enough to cause alarm. Leaves fall prematurely. When significant defoliation occurs, strong bloom fails to develop and crop production is substantially reduced. The most favorite formulations employed to fight against this disease are copper based product. However, the negative environmental effects of this heavy metal are quite a big concern leading to the search for new effective and environmentally friendly molecules. In this study, a new fungicide based on tetraconazole, an active principle with systemic action, was tested and compared to dodine and copper oxychloride. The trial was conducted during the years 2010-2012 in an olive grove of southern Italian with a Mediterranean climate. Two fungicide applications were performed each year. For each formulation employed, seven trees were treated. The disease severity on the leaves was affected by the type of fungicide used and the time of its exposure. From the comparison of control plants with the treated ones, the best results were obtained with dodine and copper oxychloride formulations. Overall, tetraconazole reduced the disease and, as a systemic action, may be associated with dodine or copper to control Spilocaea oleagina particularly when the disease is well developed. © 2014, International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Purpose We define the ideal anterior capsulotomy through consideration of capsular histology and biomechanics. Desirable qualities include preventing posterior capsular opacification (PCO), maintaining effective lens position (ELP) and optimising capsular strength. Methods Laboratory study of capsular biomechanics and literature review of histology and published clinical results. Results Parameters of ideal capsulotomy construction include complete overlap of the intraocular lens to prevent PCO, centration on the clinical approximation of the optical axis of the lens to ensure concentricity with the capsule equator, and maximal capsular thickness at the capsulotomy edge to maintain integrity. Conclusions Constructing the capsulotomy centred on the clinical approximation of the optical axis of the lens with diameter 5.25 mm optimises prevention of PCO, consistency of ELP and capsular strength.

AB  - Without any special qualifications, this paper proposed a novel method for concentric circles detection by using the geometrical characteristics of circle and the straight line Hough transform. A feature point neighborhood method and a normalized distance variance method are proposed to segment continuous curves and circles respectively for removing interference of noncircular objects which simplified the computation; Thirdly, circle centers and radius are detected by the straight line Hough transform. Because only two 2-dimensional voting are required for the circles detection, the proposed method avoided the problem of large storage which exists in the classical Hough transform and the detection efficiency is also enhanced. Finally, the concentric circles are identified and located according to the relation between the positions of circles. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the classical Hough transform, the proposed method improved execution efficiency greatly while maintaining high detection precision, it also offers good robustness in some complex images. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - A firm commitment to environmental safety calls for abandoning wells with depleting production by setting a competent cement plug in the wellbore per government regulations. To prepare the wellbore for the cement plug, concentric casing strings must be removed. When cutting and pulling the casing is not possible, it must be milled away. Milling the casing requires numerous trips into the hole, substantially raising the cost to plug and abandon (P&A) a subsea well. A conventional section mill, used to accomplish milling, has stabilization features sized close to the inside diameter of the milled casing. Multiple knives expand outward, radially far enough to mill a single casing string. Stabilization features reduce milling vibration, but their gauge-diameter prevents them from passing through some restricted-diameter tubulars that can exist above the wellbore. Reducing the gauge diameter of the mill to pass through restrictions compromises its performance and reliability. Because of the subtle nature of its stabilization features, conventional section mills are referred to as "passively stabilized". A new undersized section mill with "active stabilization" can be deployed through a restricteddiameter tubular to mill a section of casing string below it with similar performance and reliability of the conventional mill. This new actively stabilized section mill was used to mill a 70-ft. section in 11-3/4 in. casing below a restricted-diameter production riser. The mill passed through the restricted inside diameter of the riser and blowout preventer (BOP). It then expanded its stabilizer arms to centralize itself inside the casing before cutting knives expanded to begin the cut. Cutting knives slowly expanded as they cut through the casing wall, and then milled down the unwanted casing section. The stabilizer arms kept the undersized mill firmly centralized inside the milled casing, limiting lateral vibration of the mill. Leaving the riser, BOP and surface equipment in place saved the operator 3 days and USD 1 million. Active stabilization reduced vibration, improved milling performance and knife longevity, thus reducing the number of trips to mill a section of casing, substantially reducing costs and HSE risks of P&A.

AB  - Cyanea is a genus of large bloom-forming scyphozoans, including some of the most conspicuous representatives of megaplankton. Its taxonomy has been revised repeatedly throughout the last century due to the fact that most of the morphological characteristics of Cyanea species, such as color, structure of gastrovascular system and number of tentacles, may overlap greatly in different populations. Here, we report a new species of Cyanea, Cyanea tzetlinii sp. nov., from the White Sea, which is distinguishable from all previously described Cyanea species by an eye-spot-bearing bulb formed at the base of each rhopalium. This well-recognizable morphological characteristic is supported at the molecular level by a substantial genetic distance in mitochondrial (CO1: 9.6–10.6 %, 16S RNA: 3.1–3.5 %) as well as nuclear (ITS: 5.0 %, 18S RNA: 0.1 %) loci, making it the sister species to Cyanea capillata. Taking into account the young geological age of the White Sea and a substantial genetic divergence between C. tzetlinii sp. nov. and the nearest sister species, we suppose that C. tzetlinii sp. nov. has been advected to the White Sea from elsewhere and may also inhabit other Arctic seas. Past ecological studies in the White Sea and possibly in other Arctic Seas could have conflated C. tzetlinii sp. nov. with other species, which likely affected the analyses. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine heart rates, lactate levels and rates of perceived exertion responses to kickboxing competitions. A further aim was to evaluate the number of attacks and leg strength throughout the competitions. Ten kickboxers participated in the study and completed two kickboxing fights with the same opponent, at 1 week apart. After each round, lactate levels and rates of perceived exertion (CR-10 scale) were recorded, and heart rates were measured continuously throughout the competitions. One fighter from each fight was isokinetically tested for identifying lower extremity strength variations during kickboxing competitions. Each fight was also recorded by a video camera to analyse the technical actions performed. The study results suggest that metabolic demands imposed on kickboxing athletes progressively increase from round one to round three, represented by mean cardiovascular responses, lactate levels and rates of perceived exertion. However, concentric quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratio, and number of kicking and punching attempts decreased significantly over the course of consecutive rounds. In summary, it is observed that kickboxers experienced a higher physiological stress and lower work outputs during consecutive rounds. © 2015 International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport.

AB  - Many prey use multicomponent deceptive signals to fool predators into mistaking them for inedible objects, toxic prey, or dangerous animals. However, recent experiments have suggested that multicomponent deceptive signals are no more effective in deterring predators than single-component signals, making it difficult to understand how they have evolved. Here, we use an established experimental system in which naive domestic chicks are presented with models of snake-mimicking caterpillars to test the idea that multicomponent deceptive signals reduce the speed at which predators learn that prey are profitable. We presented chicks with a series of 4 trials in which they encountered a single type of caterpillar model. The type of model differed among our 4 experimental groups that were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design: models either possessed eyespots or did not and were in either the resting or defensive posture. Chicks' responses to the same model prey were then retested following an extended 72-h retention period. Chicks rapidly attacked prey with no defensive traits and initially showed similar levels of wariness to prey with either 1 or 2 deceptive traits. However, chicks learned that single-trait caterpillars were profitable more quickly than 2-trait caterpillars and retained their learned responses better. This suggests that prey with multicomponent deceptive signals may have a selective advantage over prey with single-component deceptive signals when predators repeatedly encounter such prey. © 2015 The Author 2015.

This spring-loaded, tendon-actuated cable-like continuum robot incorporates key features of a concentric tube style design with added local compression to most sections and actively controllable bending along its entire backbone. It also avoids a complicated and large actuator system. Such robotic cables can be well suited for current space and terrestrial applications like exploration, teleoperation, surveillance, maintenance activities, etc., benefiting from these unique structural properties. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Abstract This article reports an experimental and numerical study on the orientation effect for a radial heat sink with a circular base, concentric ring, and rectangular fins. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of orientation angle with respect to gravity, various geometric parameters (fin number, fin length, fin height, and height of the base), Elenbaas number, on Nusselt number. The results show that the influences of fin number and fins length on the orientation effect are significant, whereas the fin height and base height are slightly insignificant. From the numerical and experimental results, it is shown that the horizontally oriented radial heat sinks have better thermal performance than vertically oriented radial heat sink due to the existence of the concentric ring preventing the natural convective upward flow. The present numerical model is shown to predict the experimental results well within error of 4%. Finally, a closed-form correlation for predicting Nusselt number with heat sink design parameters is proposed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper combines previous cratering studies and numerical modeling of the impact process at different impact velocities to predict crater morphology on Pluto. As an icy body, Pluto's craters are expected to be similar in morphology to those on the icy satellites: lesser depth-diameter ratios (d/D), shallower wall slopes and the development of central uplifts in craters of smaller rim-to-rim diameter than craters on rocky bodies of similar gravity. The low impact velocity of the Pluto system (~2kms-1) might cause deviation from this generalization as the simulations presented in this work suggest that decreasing impact velocity from 10kms-1 to 2kms-1 results in deeper craters (larger d/D) and a simple-to-complex transition diameter at larger crater sizes than predicted based on gravity scaling alone (D>6km). Conversely, decreasing impact velocity from 2kms-1 to 300ms-1 produced smaller d/D, akin to the lower d/D noted for secondary craters. This complex relationship between impact velocity and d/D suggests that there might be a larger range of 'pristine' simple crater depths on Pluto than on bodies with higher mean impact velocity. The low impact velocities and correspondingly low volumes of impact melt generated at Pluto might prevent the occurrence, or limit the size, of floor-pits if their formation involves impact melt water. The presence, or not, of central floor-pit craters on Pluto will thus provide a valuable test of floor-pit formation theories. The presence of summit-pits or concentric craters on Pluto is plausible and would indicate the presence of layering in the near sub-surface. Palimpsests, multi-ring basins and other crater morphologies associated with high heat flow are not expected and would have important implications for Pluto's thermal history if observed by New Horizons. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The present study investigated how budgerigars and humans perceive a version of the Delboeuf illusion. In Experiment 1, we trained 4 budgerigars to discriminate between the sizes of two square targets, one of which was embedded in a concentric square frame. The birds accurately differentiated between the sizes of the targets when the target size disparity was large; however, when this disparity was small, they tended to choose the target embedded in the frame. Experiment 2 used the same stimuli and task as Experiment 1 but the participants were humans; the results suggested that the human participants perceived a normal Delboeuf illusion. Thus, these results indicate the adequacy of our stimuli and the inadequacy of tasks with two choices in comparative studies of the Delboeuf illusion as the simultaneous presentation of the two illusory figure(s) may cause unexpected choice bias.

AB  - Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions. © 2015 Manesi et al.

AB  - Silk is a protein of interest to both biological and industrial sciences. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, forms this protein into strong threads starting from soluble silk proteins using a number of biochemical and physical cues to allow the transition from liquid to fibrous silk. A pH gradient has been measured along the gland, but the methodology employed was not able to precisely determine the pH at specific regions of interest in the silk gland. Furthermore, the physiological mechanisms responsible for the generation of this pH gradient are unknown.In this study, concentric ion selective microelectrodes were used to determine the luminal pH of B. mori silk glands. A gradient from pH 8.2 to 7.2 was measured in the posterior silk gland, with a pH 7 throughout the middle silk gland, and a gradient from pH 6.8 to 6.2 in the beginning of the anterior silk gland where silk processing into fibers occurs. The small diameter of the most anterior region of the anterior silk gland prevented microelectrode access in this region. Using a histochemical method, the presence of active carbonic anhydrase was identified in the funnel and anterior silk gland of fifth instar larvae. The observed pH gradient collapsed upon addition of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide, confirming an essential role for this enzyme in pH regulation in the B. mori silk gland. Plastic embedding of whole silk glands allowed clear visualization of the morphology, including the identification of four distinct epithelial cell types in the gland and allowed correlations between silk gland morphology and silk stages of assembly related to the pH gradient.B. mori silk glands have four different epithelial cell types, one of which produces carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is necessary for the mechanism that generates an intraluminal pH gradient, which likely regulates the assembly of silk proteins and then the formation of fibers from soluble silk proteins. These new insights into native silk formation may lead to a more efficient production of artificial or regenerated silkworm silk fibers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies designed to measure dispersal capacity of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) are needed to provide the epidemiological knowledge necessary to improve management of citrus huanglongbing. In this study, a mark-release-recapture technique was used to investigate whether 1) host or non-host plants of D. citri can act as barriers for dispersing insects and 2) presence or absence of young citrus leaves influence movement of D. citri towards citrus plants. The experimental field consisted of four circular and adjacent areas containing citrus trees, Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. 'Hamlin', planted in concentric circles at 18, 24 and 30 m from the release centre. Insect activity was monitored by recapturing at each distance using yellow stick traps. Dense plantings of tall non-host plants of D. citri such as corn had no effect on insect dispersal towards citrus plants when compared to a shorter cover crop such as grass. In contrast, suitable host plants acted as traps decreasing movement of D. citri. Diaphorina citri dispersed at greater speeds in the absence of young leaves reaching 140 m within 6 hours after release, whereas in the presence of young leaves, individuals reached at most 60 m at 1 day after release. Results suggest that D. citri control measures may be more efficient during periods of highest vegetative activity when insects are less active. Moreover, the use of suitable host plants for D. citri as trap plants may be a potential tactic to prevent movement of insects into the crop. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) modelling method is probably the most popular technique to model species distributions based only on the presence records across broad spatial scales. Although it is widely used, there is much controversy about the transferability of models between different geographical areas. Transferability might be more questionable when it comes to predict the distribution of peripheral populations at the margin of the species geographical range, where they may be affected by and adapted to environmental conditions different from those of core populations. To explore transferability of MaxEnt models among sectors of the geographic range, we selected three butterfly species with wide distributions and peripheral populations at their southernmost margin in the Iberian Peninsula, namely Plebejus argus, Cyaniris semiargus and Pyronia tithonus.Using data from the Atlas of the butterflies of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands as well as both climate and land use data, we modelled their potential distribution ranges in Spain. In addition, we also independently modelled their distributions separately in three concentric sectors of their range. We then investigated the transferability of the models between sectors and the effect of varying the regularization parameter.Our results show that when developing species distribution models the quality of occurrence data should be carefully checked, paying special attention to both their number and spatial distribution and avoiding possible significant biases.The transferability of the models tends to decrease when data from increasingly distant sectors are used as test data. More precisely, and independently of the regularization parameter value, models built using occurrence data either from the core or the intermediate sectors failed to adequately predict the distribution of the three butterfly species in the peripheral sector, especially in Doñana National Park. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The current research aims to analyse theoretically and evaluate a self-manufactured simple design for subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) emitter to avoid root and soil intrusion. It was composed of three concentric cylindrical elements: an elastic silicone membrane; a polyethylene tube with two holes drilled on its wall for water discharge; and a vinyl polychloride protector system to wrap the other elements. The discharge of the emitter depends on the change in the membrane diameter when it is deformed by the water pressure. The study of the operation of this emitter is a new approach that considers mechanical and hydraulic principles. Thus, the estimation on the membrane deformation was based on classical mechanical stress theories in composite cylinders. The hydraulic principles considered the solid deformation due to force based on water pressure and the general Darcy-Weisbach head-loss equation. Twenty emitter units, with the selected design, were handcrafted in a lathe and were used in this study. The measured pressure/discharge relationship for the emitters showed good agreement with that calculated by the theoretical approach. The variation coefficient of the handcrafted emitters was high compared to commercial emitters. Results from field evaluations showed variable values for the relative flow variation, water emission uniformity and relative flow rate coefficients, but no emitter was obstructed. Therefore, the current emitter design could be suitable for SDI following further studies to develop a final prototype. © 2014 IAgrE.

AB  - There is increasing demand, from both engineers and their clients, for structures that can be rapidly returned to occupancy following an earthquake, while also maintaining or reducing initial costs. One possible way towards this goal is to ensure that seismic damage occurs only within elements that can be removed and replaced following a damaging earthquake. For concentrically braced frames that use hollow structural sections, the current design practice requires field welding of the brace to the gusset in a way that causes the brace to buckle out-of-plane. In the event of a damaging earthquake, the out-of-plane brace buckling may damage both the gusset plate and also any adjacent exterior cladding. The plate cannot be easily replaced, resulting in expensive and time-consuming repairs, and the damaged cladding could endanger the lives of people evacuating the building and of other pedestrians. This paper discusses the development of an alternative connection that can be bolted into place and that confines damage to replaceable components. The proposed connection is expected to result in reduced erection costs and be easier to repair following a major earthquake. Moreover, the new connection causes buckling to occur in plane, preventing dangerous damage to the cladding. Potential challenges in the design of such a connection are discussed and evaluated, and a finite element model that was created to confirm the performance of the proposed connection is also introduced. Finally, future areas of research and development of the connection are identified.

AB  - A fossil of the aerophytic green algal genus Phycopeltis (Trentepohliaes, Ulvophyceae) dated to 35 Ma, is reported from the Pikopiko Fossil Forest, Southland, New Zealand. Previous reports of fossilized Phycopeltis have been subsequently synonymized with fungi by other authors; however, our specimen is not vulnerable to their criticisms. Inflated cells present in two approximately concentric rings are interpreted as gametangia, with irregular structures resembling the gametangial pores of modern material; sporophytic material is absent. The fossil resembles the modern disc-forming species P. novae-zelandiae, P. expansa, and P. arundinacea. The limited material available prevents the assignation of a specific epithet, but the habit and dimensions of the fossil clearly fall within those of modern representatives of the genus. Its single cell thickness throughout, absence of distinct melanization, and larger size demonstrate that it is not a fungal shield. The specimen constitutes arguably the most convincing fossil belonging to Trentepohliales, and the first unambiguously for the genus Phycopeltis. It is consistent in age with other known fossils of the order that, when combined with molecular evidence, suggests a terrestrial radiation far more recent than that of land plants. © 2015 Phycological Society of America.

AB  - Transplant vasculopathy (TV) represents the main cause of late graft failure and limits the long-term success of organ transplantation. Cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of the concentric and diffuse intimal hyperplasia of arteries of the grafted organ. We recently reported that the mitogenic signaling, evoked in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hmSMC) by the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, implicates neutral sphingomyelinase-2, suggesting a role for sphingolipids in intimal hyperplasia of TV. Here, we investigated whether the mitogenic sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is involved in intimal hyperplasia elicited by W6/32. Studies were done on cultured hmSMC and on an in vivo model of TV, consisting of human mesenteric arteries grafted into SCID/beige mice, injected weekly with W6/32. hmSMC migration and DNA synthesis elicited by W6/32 were inhibited by the sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) inhibitor dimethylsphingosine, the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab and the S1PR1/R3 inhibitor VPC23019. W6/32 stimulated SK1 activity, while siRNA silencing SK1, S1PR1 and S1PR3 inhibited hmSMC migration. In vivo, Sphingomab significantly reduced the intimal thickening induced by W6/32. These data emphasize the role of S1P in intimal hyperplasia elicited by the humoral immune response, and open perspectives for preventing TV with S1P inhibitors. © 2015 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

AB  - In this paper, the authors propose a block-based reversible watermarking method for 2D vector map authentication. In the scheme, they divide the features of a vector map into different categories of blocks, calculate an authentication watermarkfor each block, and embed the watermarks of different blocks using a reversible watermarking method based on virtual coordinates and a fragile watermarking algorithm based on concentric circles. While the block division ensures superior accuracy of tamper localization, the two watermarking methods provide recovery of the original content. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good invisibility, reversibility and computational complexity, and can accurately locate malicious attacks such as vertex modifcation/addition/deletion and feature modifcation/addition/deletion.

AB  - Degradation and fouling of support structures in nuclear steam generators (SGs) can lead to SG tube damage and loss of SG efficiency. Inspection and monitoring of support structures combined with preventative maintenance programs can alleviate these effects and extend SG life. Conventional eddy current inspection technologies are extensively used for detecting and sizing indications from wall loss, frets at supports, cracks and other degradation modes in the tubes, as well as assessing the condition of support structures. However, these methods have limited capabilities when more than one degradation mode is present simultaneously, or when combined with fouling. Pulsed eddy current combined with principal components analysis (PCA) was examined for inspection of 15.9 mm (5/8″) Alloy-800 tubes and surrounding stainless steel (SS410) support structures. Clear separation of PCA scores associated with tubes from those associated with ferromagnetic SS410 supports permitted measurement of tube-to-support gaps, in either the presence of tube fretting or variation of relative position of the tube within SS410 supports. For concentric tubes, frets could be sized independently of SS410 hole diameter variations, which in other materials could represent support corrosion. Capability to clearly separate scores was attributed to large differences in relaxation times for diffusion of transient fields through the tube compared with diffusion into the ferromagnetic support structure. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Unsolved Problem The development of eyespots on the wing surface of butterflies of the family Nympalidae is one of the most studied examples of biological pattern formation.However, little is known about the mechanism that determines the number and precise locations of eyespots on the wing. Eyespots develop around signaling centers, called foci, that are located equidistant from wing veins along the midline of a wing cell (an area bounded by veins). A fundamental question that remains unsolved is, why a certain wing cell develops an eyespot, while other wing cells do not. Key Idea and Model We illustrate that the key to understanding focus point selection may be in the venation system of the wing disc. Our main hypothesis is that changes in morphogen concentration along the proximal boundary veins of wing cells govern focus point selection. Based on previous studies, we focus on a spatially two-dimensional reaction-diffusion system model posed in the interior of each wing cell that describes the formation of focus points. Using finite element based numerical simulations, we demonstrate that variation in the proximal boundary condition is sufficient to robustly select whether an eyespot focus point forms in otherwise identical wing cells. We also illustrate that this behavior is robust to small perturbations in the parameters and geometry and moderate levels of noise. Hence, we suggest that an anterior-posterior pattern of morphogen concentration along the proximal vein may be the main determinant of the distribution of focus points on the wing surface. In order to complete our model, we propose a two stage reaction-diffusion system model, in which an one-dimensional surface reaction-diffusion system, posed on the proximal vein, generates the morphogen concentrations that act as non-homogeneous Dirichlet (i.e., fixed) boundary conditions for the two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model posed in the wing cells. The two-stage model appears capable of generating focus point distributions observed in nature. Result We therefore conclude that changes in the proximal boundary conditions are sufficient to explain the empirically observed distribution of eyespot focus points on the entire wing surface. The model predicts, subject to experimental verification, that the source strength of the activator at the proximal boundary should be lower in wing cells in which focus points form than in those that lack focus points. The model suggests that the number and locations of eyespot foci on the wing disc could be largely controlled by two kinds of gradients along two different directions, that is, the first one is the gradient in spatially varying parameters such as the reaction rate along the anterior-posterior direction on the proximal boundary of the wing cells, and the second one is the gradient in source values of the activator along the veins in the proximal-distal direction of the wing cell. © 2015 Sekimura et al.

AB  - We present the fabrication and experimental demonstration of three free-standing binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs, which are applicable for telescopes with partially obscured pupils. Three masks, designed to be complementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5 μm thick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask. The design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working angle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring mask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function. Mask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region (i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source comprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center wavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum chamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The coronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the designs. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3-8 λ/D and 8-12 λ/D was ∼ 10-4-10-7 and ∼ 10-7, respectively, where λ is the wavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast of Mask-B was ∼ 10-4 and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5-25 λ/D) was ∼ 10-5-10-6. The effect of tilting the masks was investigated, and found to be irrelevant at the ∼ 10-7 contrast level. Therefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast free-standing masks have the potential to enable coronagraphic imaging over a wide wavelength range using both ground-based and space-borne general-purpose telescopes with pupil structures not specifically designed for coronagraphy. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - Concentric tube robot (CTR) comprises several precurved concentric tubes which can rotate and translate independently with respect to each other. Each pre-curved tube of a CTR can be controlled to rotate axially and translate along its axis, which enables the tip to bypass obstacles and finally reach the target position. The concentric tube robots enable surgeons to perform delicate procedures by combining the flexibility of elastic catheters with the use of operation tools, such as needles, forceps and grippers. Hence, many clinical applications of concentric tube robots are promising, such as transnasal robotic neurosurgery. Concentric tube robots are suitable for such minimally invasive surgeries because they are able to present various flexible shapes with great dexterity, which strengthens the ability of collision avoidance and enlarges the reachability of operation tools. This paper describes an image based visual servoing method to control the concentric tube robot so that it can reach a desired position. A model-less control algorithm is developed by first estimating and adjusting the Jacobian matrix based on measurement of each incremental movement traced by a single camera, and then generating the next motion using the estimated Jacobian matrix. Therefore, no kinematic model is required to control the CTR during experiments and the experimental results reveal the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes model-less feedback control of concentric tube robots based on visual servoing. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to outline a multilevel modeling approach to fit individual angle-specific torque curves describing concentric knee extension and flexion isokinetic muscular actions in Master athletes. The potential of the analytical approach to examine between individual differences across the angle-specific torque curves was illustrated including between-individuals variation due to gender differences at a higher level. Torques in concentric muscular actions of knee extension and knee extension at 60°·s-1 were considered within a range of motion between 5°and 85° (only torques "truly" isokinetic). Multilevel time series models with autoregressive covariance structures with standard multilevel models were superior fits compared with standard multilevel models for repeated measures to fit anglespecific torque curves. Third and fourth order polynomial models were the best fits to describe angle-specific torque curves of isokinetic knee flexion and extension concentric actions, respectively. The fixed exponents allow interpretations for initial acceleration, the angle at peak torque and the decrement of torque after peak torque. Also, the multilevel models were flexible to illustrate the influence of gender differences on the shape of torque throughout the range of motion and in the shape of the curves. The presented multilevel regression models may afford a general framework to examine angle-specific moment curves by isokinetic dynamometry, and add to the understanding mechanisms of strength development, particularly the force-length relationship, both related to performance and injury prevention. © by Humberto M.

AB  - This research focuses on improving elderly drivers’ acceptability for proactive collision avoidance systems by passive information sharing with drivers. In this paper, visual contents by concentric circles for informing risky areas and ones by dot line for informing predicted path of surrounding traffic participants were proposed as the prototypes for sharing situation comprehensions of the intelligent vehicle. The evaluation experiment with a driving simulator revealed the effectiveness of the proposed visual contents for improving acceptability and the further challenges relating to the mental models of functions of intelligent vehicles. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Background: Many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution. Work over the last decade has shown that a major function of eyespots is their ability to reduce predation by being intimidating to attacking predators. Two competing hypotheses seek to explain the cause of intimidation, one suggesting 'eye-mimicry' and the other their 'conspicuousness' as the reason. There is an on-going debate about which of these better explains the effectiveness of eyespots against predation. We undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots. We conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking Junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded. Results: We first established that birds avoided models with a pair of eyespots. However, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness. Non-eye-like, fan shaped patterns derived from eyespots were found to be just as effective as eye-like circular patterns. Furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work. However, across all experiments, models with a pair of patterns, symmetric or asymmetric, eyelike or non-eye-like, suffered from fewer attacks compared with other models. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in prey-predator signalling. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution. © 2015 Mukherjee and Kodandaramaiah; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Considering the shortcomings of inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation in practical applications, this study improved the IDW algorithm and put forward a new spatial interpolation method that named as adjusted inverse distance weighted (AIDW). In interpolating process, the AIDW is capable of taking into account the comprehensive influence of distance and position of sample point to interpolation point, by adding a coefficient (K) into the normal IDW formula. The coefficient (K) is used to adjust interpolation weight of the sample point according to its position in sample points. Theoretical analysis and practical application indicates that the AIDW algorithm could diminish or eliminate the IDW interpolation defect of non-uniform distribution of sample points. Consequently the AIDW interpolating is more reasonable, compared with the IDW interpolating. On the other hand, the contour plotting of the AIDW interpolation could effectively avoid the implausible isolated and concentric circles that originated from the defect of the IDW interpolation, with the result that the contour derived from the AIDW interpolated surface is more similar to the professional manual identification. ©, 2015, SinoMaps Press.

AB  - We present the design of a concentric tube (CT) reactor for roll-to-roll chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on flexible substrates, and its application to continuous production of graphene on copper foil. In the CTCVD reactor, the thin foil substrate is helically wrapped around the inner tube, and translates through the gap between the concentric tubes. We use a bench-scale prototype machine to synthesize graphene on copper substrates at translation speeds varying from 25 mm/min to 500 mm/min, and investigate the influence of process parameters on the uniformity and coverage of graphene on a continuously moving foil. At lower speeds, high-quality monolayer graphene is formed; at higher speeds, rapid nucleation of small graphene domains is observed, yet coalescence is prevented by the limited residence time in the CTCVD system. We show that a smooth isothermal transition between the reducing and carbon-containing atmospheres, enabled by injection of the carbon feedstock via radial holes in the inner tube, is essential to high-quality roll-to-roll graphene CVD. We discuss how the foil quality and microstructure limit the uniformity of graphene over macroscopic dimensions. We conclude by discussing means of scaling and reconfiguring the CTCVD design based on general requirements for 2-D materials manufacturing.

AB  - This article proposes a detailed study of the hollow core of the staircase, itself lodged in the core of the famous double staircase of the Chateau of Chambord. The empty-center of this concentric staircase, constructed in the 1530s, is formed by cylindrical columns whose bases and figured capitals are deformed, distorted, according to an incline close to the vertical. The perfect integration of these sculptures in a highly restricted space has, up to the present, prevented the comprehension of their extreme originality. The analysis of the complex stereotomy of the six rotations that mark the core of this staircase calls attention to a veritable feat, both sculptural and architectural. It has not been possible to find anterior or even posterior, equivalents of these accomplishments. The premise can barely be seen in the renascent architecture of the Val de Loire, in particular the two staircases of the Chateau of Blois. These realizations seem close to anamorphoses, those optical curiosities fashionable in the 1530s. However, here they are carried out in three dimensions, - something unique. The author or authors remain unknown, as does the technical apparatus used for their execution. The insertion of a concentric staircase with its highly complex core equally necessitated several adaptations of the main double staircase, ultimately making a global analysis of the three staircases indispensable.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of research was to compare strength parameters of lower limbs (knee extensors and flexors) and their asymmetries (bilateral and unilateral) in elite and sub-elite professional soccer players. Material and method: The screened sample was composed of two professional soccer teams. The first team (Team 1 - elite professional players, n = 28, age = 24.31 ± 4.79 years) was a leader of the first Czech league the second team (Team 2 - sub-elite professional players, n = 24, age = 26.19 ± 3.67 years) was a leader of the second Czech league. Maximum peak torque (PT) and derived parameters (bilateral ratio [Q:Q and H:H] and unilateral ratio [H:Q]) were evaluated using Cybex isokinetic dynamometer at three angular velocities (60, 180, 300 °•s-1) for the dominant (DL) and non-dominant leg (NL) during the knee flexion (KF) and extension (KE) in concentric contraction. The four-way mixed-design ANOVA, Student's t-test and Cohen "d" index of effect size were used for statistical analyses. Results: The factor of P (performance) revealed a significant effect on the level of isokinetic strength of lower limbs in soccer players (F(1.596)= 91.74, p < 0.01, η2= 0.14). The factors of L (laterality) did not significantly influence the level of thigh muscular strength of lower extremities in soccer players (F(1.596)= 2.47, p > 0.05, η2= 0.01). The factor of the tested muscle group (KE, KF) showed a significant effect on the compared bilateral differences (F(1.288)= 11.13, p < 0.01, η2= 0.04). Post-hoc tests also showed significantly higher (p < 0.01) values of the bilateral deficit in KF compared to KE. A significant effect was also found in the unilateral ratio of the lower limbs (H:Q) on the basis of comparison of the performance criterion (F(1.288)= 15.51, p < 0.01, η2= 0.05) and angular velocity of movement (F(2.288)= 5.56, p < 0.01, η2= 0.04). The unilateral ratio (H:Q) was significantly higher in both the dominant and non-dominant limbs in favour of the higher performance Team 1 in comparison to Team 2 (H:Q ratio dominant limb: F(1.144)= 5.87, p < 0.05, η2= 0.04; non-dominant limb: F(1.144)= 11.21, p < 0.01, η2= 0.07). Discussions and conclusions: The results of the study suggest that more than 50 % of players have at least one strength asymmetry regardless of their performance level. Elite professional players have greater muscular strength of KE and KF, especially at higher angular velocity. Concerning sub-elite players, we found a lower unilateral H:Q ratio. The results of the study point to worse preparedness of KF (performance and prevention perspective) in the sub-elite players. Maladaptive effects in terms of different kinds of body strength asymmetries represent a potential risk of a player's injury; therefore the detected asymmetries should be systematically monitored and compensated using specific exercises.

AB  - Background: Awareness of prevalence, determinants, and prognosis of asymptomatic untreated prehypertension is still lacking especially in India and subcontinent. The present study was to assess the effects of prehypertension on structure, function and geometrical pattern of left ventricle on the basis of left ventricular mass (LVM), left ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI/Ht), and relative wall thickness (RWT) recorded by echocardiography based on the American society of echocardiography (ASE) convention. Methods: The study population included prehypertensives (n 61; 31 M, 30 F) and normotensives (n 38; 19 M, 19 F) between age 25 and 65 years, and were assessed by echocardiography. Results: It was observed that the stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), were found to be little elevated but was not significant in hypertensive females compared to normotensives. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), end systolic stress (ESS), and end isovolumetric systolic stress (EISS) were significantly elevated (p<0.001) in female prehypertensives compared to normotensives. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was significantly (p< 0.05) elevated, indicating alterations in cardiac morphology and functions even during prehypertensive stage. However, in prehypertensive males, SBP, DBP, HR, PP, MAP, ESS, and EISS were significantly (<0.001) raised; ejection fraction (EF%) and fractional fibre shortening (FS%) were noted to be within normal range in both sexes. Prehypertensive males showed changes in left ventricular geometry in the form of concentric remodeling (CR-3.44%), eccentric hypertrophy (EH-3.44%) and concentric hypertrophy (CH-13.79%). Prehypertensive females showed (CR-6.45%), (EH-3.22%) and (CH-6.4%). Conclusion: Such findings carry prognostic implication and require further population survey involving a larger group. Early diagnosis of prehypertension will help to take necessary preventive measures to reduce mainly the future cardiovascular complications. The care of prehypertensive subjects should include, to reduce the afterload in order to improve the left ventricular contractile state as early as possible. So it is advisable to do routine echocardiography after the age of 40 years.

AB  - Four hundred and sixty seven coal gas explosion accidents that occurred in China between the years of 1950 and 2000 were investigated through statistical methods so as to review the overall situation and provide quantitative information on coal gas explosion accidents. Statistical characteristics about accident-related factors such as space, time, gas accumulation reasons, gas grade, ignition sources, accidents categories, and accident economic loss were analyzed. Some special conclusions have been achieved. For example, most gas explosion accidents were found to have concentricity on the space-time and hazard characteristics. Such results may be helpful to prevent coal gas explosion accidents. Moreover, comments were made on APS (Accident Prevention System) and safety culture. In conclusion, countermeasures were proposed in accordance with the results of statistical studies, including the change of safety check time. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots are known to function in predator deflection and predator intimidation, but it is still unclear what factors cause eyespots to serve one function over the other. Both functions have been demonstrated in different species that varied in eyespot size, eyespot number and wing size, leaving the contribution of each of these factors to butterfly survival unclear. Here, we study how each of these factors contributes to eyespot function by using paper butterfly models, where each factor is varied in turn, and exposing these models to predation in the field. We find that the presence of multiple, small eyespots results in high predation, whereas single large eyespots (larger than 6 mm in diameter) results in low predation. These data indicate that single large eyespots intimidate predators, whereas multiple small eyespots produce a conspicuous, but non-intimidating signal to predators. We propose that eyespots may gain an intimidation function by increasing in size. Our measurements of eyespot size in 255 nymphalid butterfly species show that large eyespots are relatively rare and occur predominantly on ventral wing surfaces. By mapping eyespot size on the phylogeny of the family Nymphalidae, we show that these large eyespots, with a potential intimidation function, are dispersed throughout multiple nymphalid lineages, indicating that phylogeny is not a strong predictor of eyespot size. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We sought to investigate the role of aldosterone as a mediator of disease and its relationship with the counterregulatory natriuretic peptide (NP) system. We measured plasma aldosterone (n=1674; aged≥45 years old) in a random sample of the general population from Olmsted County, MN. In a multivariate logistic regression model, aldosterone analyzed as a continuous variable was associated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR]=1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.57-1.96; P<0.0001), obesity (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.21-1.48; P<0.0001), chronic kidney disease (OR=1.39; 95% CI=1.22-1.60; P<0.0001), central obesity (OR=1.47; 95% CI=1.32-1.63; P<0.0001), metabolic syndrome (OR=1.41; 95% CI=1.26- 1.58; P<0.0001), high triglycerides (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.11-1.36; P<0.0001), concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (OR=1.22; 95% CI=1.09-1.38; P=0.0007), and atrial fibrillation (OR=1.24; 95% CI=1.01-1.53; P=0.04), after adjusting for age and sex. The associations with hypertension, central obesity, metabolic syndrome, triglycerides, and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index, NPs, and renal function. Furthermore, aldosterone in the highest tertile correlated with lower NP levels and increased mortality. Importantly, most of these associations remained significant even after excluding subjects with aldosterone levels above the normal range. In conclusion, we report that aldosterone is associated with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and lower NPs in the general community. Our data suggest that aldosterone, even within the normal range, may be a biomarker of cardiorenal and metabolic disease. Further studies are warranted to evaluate a therapeutic and preventive strategy to delay the onset and progression of disease, using mineralocorticoid antagonists or chronic NP administration in high-risk subjects identified by plasma aldosterone. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anti-swarming potential of Pelargonium graveolens essential oil against the Proteus isolate. Materials and methods: The effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of Pelargonium graveolens essential oil and aroma-chemicals was studied on swarming differentiation of urinary Proteus mirabilis isolate. The parameters under study were number of concentric rings and diameter of swarm fronts. Results and Discussion: The concentrations of P. graveolens essential oil ranging from 1.12-8.96 mg/ml showed a pronounced reduction in the diameter of the colony as a function of time. Evident reduction in the number of concentric rings was also observed due to the incorporation of P. graveolens essential oil at 8.96 mg/ml and 4.48 mg/ml concentrations. Conclusion: Hence, the inhibition of swarming by P. graveolens essential oil suggests its potential to be developed as a product for preventing P. mirabilis infections. © 2015, Ibn Sina Trust.

AB  - Context: Many studies have explored closed kinetic chain (CKC) shoulder exercises (SEs) with a sling because they are safer and more effective than open-chain exercises, especially in early stages of treatment. However, the application of CKC SE in youth baseball players has rarely been attempted, although teenage baseball players also experience shoulder pain. Objective: To investigate the effects of CKC SE on the peak torque of shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) in youth baseball players. Design: Single-group pretest, posttest. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: 23 Little League Baseball players with subacromial impingement syndrome. Interventions: The CKC SE with a sling was CKC shoulder-flexion exercise, extension exercise, IR exercise, and ER exercise. This exercise regimen was conducted 2 or 3 times/wk for 8 wk. Main Outcome Measures: The peak torque of shoulder IR and ER was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Concentric shoulder rotation was performed, with 5 repetitions at an angular velocity of 60°/s and 15 at 180°/s. Results: The IR and ER peak torque significantly increased at each angular velocity after the exercise program. In particular, the increase in IR and ER peak torque values was statistically significant at an angular velocity of 180°/s. Conclusions: CKC SE was effective in increasing shoulder IR and ER strength, demonstrating its potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of shoulder injury. In addition, increased IR peak torque appears to improve throwing velocity in baseball players. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Laguna Potrok Aike is a large maar lake located in the semiarid steppe of southern Patagonia known for its Lateglacial and Holocene lake level fluctuations. Based on sedimentary, seismic and geomorphological evidences, the lake level curve is updated and extended into the Last Glacial period and the geomorphological development of the lake basin and its catchment area is interpreted.Abrasion and lake level oscillations since at least ~50ka caused concentric erosion of the surrounding soft rocks of the Miocene Santa Cruz Formation and expanded the basin diameter by approximately 1km. A high lake level and overflow conditions of the lake were dated by luminescence methods and tephra correlation to the early Lateglacial as well as to ~45ka. The lowest lake level of record occurred during the mid-Holocene. A further lake level drop was probably prevented by groundwater supply. This low lake level eroded a distinct terrace into lacustrine sediments. Collapse of these terraces probably caused mass movement deposits in the profundal zone of the lake. After the mid-Holocene lake level low stand a general and successive transgression occurred until the Little Ice Age maximum; i.e. ca 40m above the local groundwater table. Frequent lake level oscillations caused deflation of emerged terraces only along the eastern shoreline due to prevailing westerly winds. Preservation of eolian deposits might be linked to relatively moist climate conditions during the past 2.5ka.Precisely dated lake level reconstructions in the rain-shadow of the Andes document high Last Glacial and low Holocene lake levels that could suggest increased precipitation during the Last Glacial period. As permafrost in semiarid Patagonia is documented and dated to the Last Glacial period we argue that the frozen ground might have increased surficial runoff from the catchment and thus influenced the water balance of the lake. This is important for investigating the glacial to Holocene latitudinal shift and/or strengthening of the Southern Hemispheric Westerlies by using lake level reconstructions as a means to assess the regional water balance. Our interpretation explains the contradiction with investigations based on pollen data indicating drier climatic conditions for the Last Glacial period. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Video fingerprints generated from global features are usually vulnerable against general geometric transformations. In this paper, a novel video fingerprinting algorithm is proposed, in which a new spatio-temporal gradient is designed to represent the spatial and temporal information for each frame, and a new partition scheme, based on concentric circle and rings, is developed to resist the attacks efficiently. The centroids of spatio-temporal gradient orientations (CSTGO) within the circle and rings are then calculated to generate a robust fingerprint. Our experiments with different attacks have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and discrimination. © 2013 KSII.

AB  - The nitric acid plant of a domestic petrochemical complex is designed to annually produce 56,400 metric tons (based on 100% nitric acid). In the present work, radial-flow spherical bed reactor (RFSBR) for selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides (NOx) from the stack of this plant was modelled and compared with the conventional radial-flow reactor (CRFR). Moreover, the proficiency of a radial-flow (water or nitrogen) membrane reactor was also compared with the CRFR which was found to be inefficient at identical process conditions. In the RFSBR, the space between the two concentric spheres is filled by a catalyst. A mathematical model, including conservation of mass has been developed to investigate the performance of the configurations. The model was checked against the CRFR in a nitric acid plant located at the domestic petrochemical complex. A good agreement was observed between the modelling results and the plant data. The effects of some important parameters such as pressure and temperature on NOx conversion were analysed. Results show 14% decrease in NOx emission annually in RFSBR compared with the CRFR, which is beneficial for the prevention of NOx emission, global warming and acid rain. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Hamstring injuries are common in professional football and have been related to the imbalance between knee flexor and extensor strength. The aim of our study was to relate the maximum strength values of flexor eccentric/extensor concentric (Flexexc30/Extcon240) and peak torque angle with the hamstring injuries incidence sustained by football players during a season to provide reference values of this parameter to allow injuries prevention. Twenty players of a Second Division team of the Football Professional League bilaterally performed an isokinetic test of eccentric knee flexion at 30°/s and concentric knee extension at 240°/s during the pre-season. The Flexexc30/Extcon240 ratio and the knee angle of peak torque were calculated, and the players' injuries were registered throughout the season. The results showed that two of the five injured players had Flexexc30/Extcon240 ratios lower than 0,89, value that has been previously used to determine the imbalance between knee flexor and extensor strength and the risk of injury (Croisier, Ganteaume, Binet, Genty, and Ferret, 2008). In addition, another two injured players obtained ratios between 0,93 and 1,00. On the other hand, no differences in the knee angle of peak torque between injured and non-injured players were found. These results indicate that the Flexexc30/Extcon240 ratio may be a useful index to determine the risk of hamstring injury in professional football players.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots have evolved in multiple taxa and presumably function to thwart predator attacks. Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to simply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted over. Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - Jacques Derrida's poststructuralism and George Lindbeck's postliberalism seem strongly to challenge both each other and the possibility for meaningful interreligious dialogue. When put into controlled conversation with each other, however, they create space for theories of "concentricity" and "cultural dialects" that allow interreligious interlocutors to begin to understand one another. While many theories of interreligious dialogue denounce or avoid Ludwig Wittgenstein's insistence on particularity and the difficulty of the intelligible communication of meaning, a comparison between Derrida's and Lindbeck's semiotic hesitations can create space for a neo-Wittgensteinian approach to interreligious communication that realizes its potential in its near impossibility. In so doing, this form of dialogue will allow particularity, hospitality, and ethical hope to remain as indispensable within the dialogue as they are within the participating traditions.

AB  - Using Pro/E 3D modeling software to create three-dimensional model of gun drill, the modal analysis was carried out on the drill bit based on the theory of vibration, and the drilling parameters was selected based on natural frequency. Using large-scale finite element analysis software DEFORM-3D, point ridge displacement changes of drilling tool was simulated and analyzed by 3D numerical simulation in the process of gun drill drilling aluminum alloy. The simulation results show that, in order to prevent the concentricity error caused by resonance becoming large, it is significant that drilling parameter is selected according to the inherent frequency, and the results provide a theoretical reference to prevent hole axis deviation in deep hole processing.

AB  - Small eyespots on butterflies have long been thought to deflect attacks, and birds are the presumptive drivers selecting for these patterns; however, evidence of this function is still ambiguous. Marginal eyespots typically consist of a UV-reflective white pupil, surrounded by one black and one yellowish ring. We have recently shown that Cyanistes caeruleus (blue tits) attack such eyespots, but only under low light intensities with accentuated UV levels: the increased salience of the eyespots relative to the rest of the butterfly probably explains this result. Possibly the background against which the butterfly is concealed may deceive birds to make similar errors. We therefore presented speckled wood butterflies decorated with eyespots (or controls without eyespots) to C. caeruleus against two backgrounds: oak and birch bark. Our results show that: (1) eyespots, independent of background, were effective in deflecting attacks; (2) the time elapsed between a bird landing and the attack was interactively dependent on the background and whether the butterfly bore an eyespot; and (3) the speed at which a butterfly was attacked predicted the outcome, with faster birds being more prone to errors than slower birds. This underscores a speed-accuracy trade-off in the predators, and that background plays a role in the defensive qualities of marginal eyespots. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - This paper proposed a method of path planning in three-dimensional space based on concentric spherical coordinate and improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. First the model of three-dimensional path planning of UAV was analyzed. Then the encoding method based on concentric spherical coordinate system was given. The constraints were combined with the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to make the path more rational and the searching more efficiently. At the same time using Matlab7.0 as the development tool for simulation, the simulation analyses showed that the method of path planning in this paper is applicable and acceptable, which could achieve the goal of terrain following and threat avoidance (TF/TA2). © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Agonists/antagonists strength balance is an essential component of articular stability and motor act. The sporting practice often causes disturbances of this balance, at the origin of musculotendinous injuries. The objective of the therapists and the physical preparers is to preserve this muscular balance without compromising the athletic performance. The functional ratio bench in isocinetism antagonists eccentric/ agonists concentric must guide the curative action and the training. The most acceptable compromise is the realization of total concentric strengthening interesting the agonists and antagonists associated with a specific eccentric strengthening of the antagonists. To date it is not possible to know if the muscular imbalance is a crucial factor of the performance or simply a potentially noxious consequence of the training. Complementary studies are necessary to answer these questions. © ACAPS, EDP Sciences, 2013.

AB  - The ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus uses fagaceous tree species as its hosts, and causes Japanese oak wilt by transporting and introducing the pathogenic fungus Raffaelea quercivora into the host tree. To protect fagaceous trees, it is necessary to understand the host selection process used by the beetle in heterogeneous forests. The occurrence of beetle attack on Quercus crispula and Castanea crenata was monitored from 2008 to 2011 in two 1-ha and one 0.5-ha plots established in a secondary forest. The stem and crown densities of each fagaceous tree species were calculated at 11 different spatial scales for each individual tree. Model application and selection were performed to clarify factors affecting the probability of attack by P. quercivorus. As shown in previous studies, a higher probability of attack was predicted for Q. crispula than for C. crenata, and the predicted probability of attack was lower for trees attacked in the previous year. The effect of stem density on the probability of attack was positive at a small (radius 5m) spatial scale and negative at larger (radius 5-17.5m) scales. We interpreted this to indicate that a dense distribution of fagaceous trees in a small area had a higher probability of attack, and that this probability decreased with an increasing density of fagaceous trees in a surrounding concentric area. A positive effect of crown density was detected, suggesting that P. quercivorus has a means of detecting host trees in areas with high crown densities of fagaceous species. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - The success of biological control programs, with parasitoids depends on the evaluation of the behavior of parasitoids in the field. Thus, dispersal of Trichospilus diatraeae Cherian & Margabandhu, 1942 (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was studied in a ratoon crop of sugar cane at seven months of age in Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. Ten 452-m2 stands were delimited and inside them four concentric circles with radius of three, six, nine and 12 m with four, eight, 12 and 16 collection sites, respectively. Collection sites were represented by traps with one Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius, 1794) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) pupae inside each of them. Two thousand parasitoids (44250 parasitoids ha-1) were released at the central point, except in control plots, and the traps were collected after 48 hours. Parasitism was reduced as the distance from the release site increased with means of 12.5% at three and 2.5% at 12 m. Formicidae specimens preyed 59.0% of D. saccharalis pupae and 34.0% of these pupae were not found by parasitoids or predators because of emergence of moth. T. diatraeae females found and parasitized D. saccharalis pupae in sugar cane with seven months of ratoon up to 12 m from the release site.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to investigate the effect of FIFA 11+ (11+) and HarmoKnee injury preventive warm-up programs on conventional strength ratio (CSR), dynamic control ratio (DCR) and fast/slow speed ratio (FSR) in young male professional soccer players. These ratios are related to the risk of injury to the knee in soccer players. Methods: Thirty-six players were divided into 3 groups; FIFA 11+, HarmoKnee and control (n = 12 per group). These exercises were performed 3 times per week for 2 months (24 sessions). The CSR, DCR and FSR were measured before and after the intervention. Results: After training, the CSR and DCR of knee muscles in both groups were found to be lower than the published normal values (0.61, 0.72, and 0.78 during 60°.s-1, 180°.s-1 and 300°.s-1, respectively). The CSR (60°.s-1) increased by 8% and FSR in the quadriceps of the non-dominant leg by 8% in the 11+. Meanwhile, the DCR in the dominant and non-dominant legs were reduced by 40% and 30% respectively in the 11+. The CSR (60°.s-1) in the non-dominant leg showed significant differences between the 11+, HarmoKnee and control groups (p = 0.02). As for the DCR analysis between groups, there were significant differences in the non-dominant leg between both programs with the control group (p = 0.04). For FSR no significant changes were found between groups. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the 11+ improved CSR and FSR, but the HarmoKnee program did not demonstrate improvement. We suggest adding more training elements to the HarmoKnee program that aimed to enhance hamstring strength (CSR, DCR and FSR). Professional soccer players have higher predisposition of getting knee injuries because hamstring to quadriceps ratio were found to be lower than the average values. It seems that the 11+ have potentials to improve CSR and FSR as well as prevent knee injuries in soccer players. © 2012 Daneshjoo et al.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is a disease that causes obstructions to develop within the arterial system; these obstructions can result in an acute vascular event such as a heart attack or stroke, and potentially death. In the majority of cases a standard angioplasty balloon is sufficient to dilate the site of an obstruction; however difficult obstructions, such as heavily calcified lesions require specialist dilation solutions. One such example of a device is Boston Scientific's cutting balloon. An analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database demonstrates that the original cutting balloon has a number of distinct adverse events associated with it. In this study we describe the design, manufacturing, and testing of a new force focused angioplasty balloon that has the potential to reduce or eliminate the adverse events associated with the Boston Scientific cutting balloon. This design incorporates two elastomeric materials to aid recoiling of the device namely: nitinol and a silicone elastomer. New methods of manufacturing are described in this study, that ensure that precision molding and assembly can occur. To determine the effectiveness of our device, we simulated concentric calcified lesions with a surrogate chalk model. These results demonstrate that our device has a significantly lower lesion burst pressure in comparison to a standard angioplasty balloon, 174 atm versus 12.48 atm. To determine if our device reduced potential snagging, and thus reduced the risk of withdrawal resistance being encountered, we performed a withdrawal resistance test. A noticeably lower withdrawal force is associated with our device, the high peaks on the Boston Scientific device indicate that there may be wings forming on the balloon and these are catching on the tip of the introducer sheath. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo efficacy of our device in a porcine model. By the use of elastomeric recoiling features in a new cutting balloon design we have been able to overcome the three main reported adverse events associated with the Boston Scientific cutting balloon. Subsequently we experimentally demonstrated this improved efficacy for one particular peripheral balloon size (e.g., 5 mm diameter). Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - We present a novel algorithm that automatically detects anomalies in pipeline right of the way (ROW) regions in aerial surveillance videos. Early detection of anomalies on pipeline ROWs avoids failures or leaks. Vehicles that are potential threats vary in size, shape and color. The detection algorithm should be fast to enable detection in real-time. In this paper, we propose a rotation-invariant gradient histogram based descriptor built in CIELab color space. An SVM with radial basis kernel is used as the classifier. We use only the a and b components since they represent the color values. The region of interest is divided into concentric circular regions. The number of such concentric regions is based on the size of the target. The inner regions capture the local characteristics and finer details of the image. Larger regions capture the global characteristics. A noise reducing differentiation kernel is used to compute the gradient of the region to cope with motion blur and noise introduced by atmospheric aberrations. A gradient orientation histogram is constructed in each region by voting the magnitude of gradients. The final descriptor is build by concatenating the magnitude of DFT of orientation histograms collected from a component and b components. The magnitude of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the histogram is invariant to rotations. DFT can be efficiently computed as Fast Fourier Transfrom (FFT). Since the algorithm uses a sliding window detector, it can easily be parallelized. © 2014 SPIE.

AB  - Four hundred and sixty seven coal gas explosion accidents that occurred in China between the years of 1950 and 2000 were investigated through statistical methods so as to review the overall situation and provide quantitative information on coal gas explosion accidents. Statistical characteristics about accident-related factors such as space, time, gas accumulation reasons, gas grade, ignition sources, accidents categories, and accident economic loss were analyzed. Some special conclusions have been achieved. For example, most gas explosion accidents were found to have concentricity on the space-time and hazard characteristics. Such results may be helpful to prevent coal gas explosion accidents. Moreover, comments were made on APS (Accident Prevention System) and safety culture. In conclusion, countermeasures were proposed in accordance with the results of statistical studies, including the change of safety check time. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Location is important for most wireless sensor network applications. A potential localisation method uses a mobile beacon instead of numerous static beacons. This method includes planning a beacon trajectory as a fundamental and interesting problem. Obstacles in practical scenarios often restrict the free locomotion of beacons. This study examines the obstacle-avoidance path-planning method, which consists of three stages. First, the network deployment region is partitioned into cells by adaptive cell decomposition, and the corresponding connectivity graph is constructed. Second, a modified max-min ant system algorithm is provided to obtain the approximate shortest global path that covers the connectivity graph. Finally, a sequence of concentric circles of adjustable radii is utilised as the local path within an obstacle-free cell. We prove that all sensor nodes deployed in obstacle-free cells can be localised by using the proposed path. Simulation results show that more than 90% of the sensor nodes in the obstacle-free region can be localised by using the given trajectory. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

AB  - A solution layer crystallization process in a concentric annulus is presented that removes the need for filtration. A dynamic model for layer crystallization with and without a recirculation loop is developed in the form of coupled partial differential equations describing the effects of mass transfer, heat transfer, and crystallization kinetics. The model predicts the variation of the temperature, concentration, and dynamic crystal thickness along the pipe length, and the concentration and temperature along the pipe radius. The model predictions are shown to closely track experimental data that were not used in the model's construction, and also compared to an analytical solution that can be used for quickly obtaining rough estimates when there is no recirculation loop. The model can be used to optimize product yield and crystal layer thickness uniformity, with constraints on the supersaturation to avoid bulk nucleation by adjusting cooling temperatures in the core and jacket. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the external (ER) and internal rotator (IR) muscles' isokinetic peak torque and conventional and functional strength ratios in handball players and controls of different ages. Design: Cross-sectional and descriptive analysis. Setting: Exercise Physiology Laboratory. Participants: A total of 228 participants (108 athletes and 120 controls) were divided into five groups according to age, ranging from 13 to 36 years old. Main outcome measures: Isokinetic tests were performed concentrically at 60 and 300 degs-1 and eccentrically at 300degs-1. Results: The differences between the athletes and controls regarding the peak torque of the ER and IR muscles were significant in males older than 18 years. The peak torque of the IR and ER muscles increased significantly across age in male athletes, but not in female athletes, except in the case of ER peak torque, which differed significantly between 13 and 16 years old. The female athletes presented higher conventional ratios (0.81±0.07) than males (0.66±0.08). Values represent means and standard deviations. Athletes and controls showed mean functional strength ratios below 1.0. Conclusions: Although there were no muscular ratio differences between the athletes and the controls, their ratio values were below the literature-recommended reference values to prevent shoulder injuries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Clustering is recognized as sigificant technique for analysing data and concentric effort has been taken in different domains comprises of recognition of pattern, statistical analysis and data mining for decades. Subspace clustering is developed from the group of cluster objects from all subspaces of a dataset. During clustering of objects involing higher dimension, the accuracy and effectiveness of traditional clustering algorithms are very poor, because data objects may present in different clusters involving different subspaces of differing level of dimensions. To address the above issue, a new technique termed Difference Subspace and Opportunistic Clustering (DSOC) model is presented for high dimensional data to improve the accuracy during the search process and also considers the problem of accuracy in clustering the high dimensional data. Methods for obtaining subspace and designing clustering model for DSOC are specified and demonstrated, where the subspace identify the possibility of each cluster center with the detection of attackers based on multiple locations and estimation points with derived centroid points. Through comprehensive mathematical analysis, we show that DSOC improves the accuracy in high dimensional data with efficient cluster validation obtained using different subspace and opportunistic algorithm. As validated by extensive experiments on CORTINA and Ski Resort Data Set datasets DSOC produces high quality clusters by detecting the attackers and the efficiency of DSOC outperforms previous works. © 2014 Science Publications.

AB  - Introduction: The instrumented jump tests evaluation inform us about the functional capabilities and neuromuscular variables assisting in the care of athletes. It is essential to give a greater attention to the basic categories because it contains important stages of development of the athletes who are the future of the sport. Objective: To evaluate the functional and neuromuscular youth soccer athletes' category based on performance in jump tests. Methods: Soccer players aged between 15 and 17 years were evaluated. The following jump tests were performed on two force platforms: squat Jump; countermovement test; drop jump of 40 cm. To analyze the variables concentric and eccentric forces, impact and height of jumps, the Shapiro-Wilk test, mean and standard deviation of variables with p ≤ 0.05 were used. Results: Of the 30 athletes evaluated, we found: three goalkeepers (10%), five quarterbacks (16.7%), one winger (3.3%), three defensive midfielders (10%), 12 midfielders (40%) and six strikers (20%). The under 17 category had higher results compared to the under 15;it was achieved maximum height of the countermovement jump over the squat jump (p < 0.05) and drop jump (p > 0.05); no difference was found in concentric force between the categories and types of jumps; greater impact force was obtained on countermovement jump and an increased strength in the right lower limb was found in all jump tests and variables. Conclusions: We found an asymmetry between the lower limbs, which may correlate with a muscle power deficit, poor eccentric movement and biomechanical errors. These predisposing factors for musculoskeletal injuries can be prevented. The instrumented evaluation of muscle force through these tests can assist club professionals as a working tool, able to enhance training programs, preparation and rehabilitation. However, more research is needed in order to evaluate different moments of the athlete's age and season.

AB  - Forest and wetland degradation due to human disturbance is detrimental to pond-breeding amphibians that require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their complex life cycle. in this study, we examined the importance of forest cover within concentric non-overlapping terrestrial zones on amphibian reproductive effort. on the southern Cumberland plateau, tennessee, uSa, we counted Spotted Salamander (ambystoma maculatum) egg masses in February and march 2004 at 25 ephemeral ponds either surrounded by cut or uncut forest. using regression tree analysis, we determined which of 10 local and landscape parameters (pond area, ph, temperature, maximum water depth, dissolved oxygen, canopy cover, number of ponds within 1,000 m, percent forest in 2003 within 0-164, 164-250, and 250-1,000 m) best predicted salamander egg mass densities. egg mass densities were significantly higher at ponds within uncut forests and positively associated with forest cover at all three spatial zones measured (0-164, 164-250, and 250-1,000 m). all but two ponds with surrounding cut forests contained breeding populations of a. maculatum even though the majority of the core terrestrial zone was highly disturbed. our data suggest that ephemeral ponds with disturbed core terrestrial habitats are still used by salamanders for breeding. despite the obvious importance of preserving forest habitat around wetlands, the complete loss of amphibian populations following extensive terrestrial habitat loss may be prevented by retaining aquatic habitats and forest cover at exterior spatial zones. © 2013.

AB  - Three temporary pools of Sejenane region (northern Tunisia) have been studied with the aims of characterizing their vegetation, and of specifying the impact of grazing on their structure, composition and dynamics. Permanent transects of quadrats have been surveyed in spring and summer during two (not-grazed pool) to three years (grazed pools). The vegetation of the three pools is organized in three concentric belts related to the topographic gradient. The between-years dynamics is strongly characterized by the alternation of distinct spring and summer vegetations. Grazing appears as the main control of the composition and structure of hydrophytic plant communities. It prevents the colonization by competitive, perturbation-sensitive species, and favours the persistence of annual, light-demanding dwarf plants. In order to protect the biodiversity of these rare habitats in Tunisia, it is necessary to maintain, through an adapted management of grazing, a landscape mosaic of grazed and not-grazed zones.

AB  - We describe the final instars of two tropical Sphingidae caterpillars - Eumorpha phorbas and Eumorpha labruscae - from Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica, whose anal horn has become a posterior eyespot structure capable of rapid palpitation. When approached or harassed, the caterpillars palpitate this eyespot and produce the effect of a blinking vertebrate eye. We propose that this "blinking" is an extension of eye mimicry or at least draws attention to the eyespot, functioning to startle or intimidate would-be predators. As snakes lack eyelids and do not blink, this suggests that the blinking eye represents a more generalized (or possibly mammalian) eye. Eyespot "blinking" is probably controlled by the same musculature used to wave the anal horn in earlier instars. The extent to which this eyespot is perceived as a blinking eye, and the degree of protection from the caterpillars' suite of potential predators, remain to be discovered. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A large sample of trapped adult males of' Hyaloplwra euryalus, H. Columbia gloveri, and intergrades from a hybrid zone between these taxa were scored for seven categories of wing damage. A total of 6.1% of 471 adults showed wing damage consistent with bird strikes. Among categories of wing damage, a significantly higher frequency of strikes involved the HW discal spot and the apical eye spot. Patterns of wing damage and behavior of adults when threatened were evaluated in the context of formal models of wing markings as anti-predator mechanisms. Discal spots may act to intimidate predators, while apical eye spots may deflect attacks away from the body. Certain markings are highly conserved and concordant with DNA-based saturniid phylogeny.

AB  - Hydro-turbine generator unit turning test is a key step to check the installation quality of the shafting system. The unit turning data is very important for bearing clearance adjustment. The traditional unit turning test and bearing clearance adjustment are based on a condition of that the spindle turning orbit is an approximate circle. It is simple to be used in the field operation and applicable to the most units. The trajectory of the turning orbit shows irregular shape when the spindle has a certain part of the flaw. If the traditional method is used for the unit turning and adjusting the bearing clearance, this may cause the eccentricity of three guide bearing bushes and uneven of the bearing clearance. The unit may appear a high temperature or large swing phenomenon after its commission. Seriously the unit may be burned and permanent damage. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a new method to calculate a minimum rotation space of the shaft in the bearing for each guide bearing clearance according to a geometric algorithm. Using the new method, according to the minimum circumscribed circle of the turning axis locus and final position of the turning spindle after unit turning, the bearing clearances corresponding to each turning number on the shaft can be calculated precisely. And then the bearing radial position is distributed properly so that the bearing is in the centre of rotation to the centre of the concentric circle. Therefore, the specific value of each bearing clearance adjustment is obtained. Site testing results show that using the new method the high temperature and large adjustment gap caused by using the traditional method can be avoided. Thus, the hydro-turbine generator unit operating stability is improved. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - The Carpathian Mountains across Slovakia and Romania are home of several ice caves located at elevations between 700 and 1,200 m above sea level (asl). Although the mean surface annual temperature is above the freezing point, perennial ice deposits are common in caves and shafts with certain morphologies (large entrances followed by steep vertical or downwardsloping passages), into which the dense cold winter air sinks and remains trapped all year round. A particular type of cave pearls (cryogenic cave pearls, CCPs) occur in spatially restricted accumulations or extensive pearl fields (layers locally up to 0.5 m in thickness) within the scree covering the cave floor in the periglacial zone of these caves. The temperature in the periglacial zone oscillates around the freezing point, promoting seasonal ice formation. A similar type of pearl is observed in the entrance section of other caves that experience temporary freezing conditions during the cold season. When compared to pearls of non-iced caves, those from ice caves always occur at sites where liquid water cannot accumulate. CCP formation in nests with drips or in cave pools surrounded by rimstone dams is therefore excluded. Freezing-thawing processes are responsible for moving the pearls, preventing their cementation to the floor or between them. Results of U-series and radiocarbon dating indicate that the pearls are Holocene in age, with their growth continuing into the present. Pearls show high porosity, ranging from 7.6 to 22.6%. In the center they frequently contain radial aggregates of larger carbonate crystals, and their concentric layering is less obvious compared to normal cave pearls. In addition, polygonal pearls and pearl aggregates are common. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope study indicates the formation of an initial crystal aggregate by cryogenic precipitation during freezing of drip water. After that, pearls grow by addition of new carbonate layers, either at water freezing conditions or at temperature above 0°C. Overall, the pearl isotope data plot along a mixing line in the δ13C vs. δ18O diagram, connecting the field of normal speleothems of non-iced caves of the area, with the field of fine-grained cryogenic carbonate powder, formed in the glaciated parts of the ice caves. Seasonal water freezing and frost action in the cave periglacial zone is a necessary condition for the formation of these pearls. © 2013 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).

AB  - The presence of perforated surfaces provides stiffness to acoustic filters and prevents that any absorbent material can be detached. Due to the interaction of flow with the perforations, their acoustic response is partly dissipative so that the total attenuation of the muffler is improved. In addition, they induce low pressure loss in the flow thus having little impact on engine performance. By means of non-concentric layouts, interferential systems may be configured inside mufflers which, depending on the geometrical definition, may give rise to acceptable attenuation levels for broad-band noise abatement. Since cost-effective and reliable calculation tools are still required for the optimum design of such non-concentric perforated duct mufflers, a calculation model able to reproduce both the resistive and reactive effects of the perforated duct is proposed in this paper. With this purpose, a finite volume scheme has been used for the description of tridimensional acoustic cavities, and the dissipative effect of the perforations has been implemented through the introduction of a resistive term in the linearized flow equations, which is obtained assuming a local mean flow in the vicinity of the holes. The accuracy of the model has been verified against measurements performed in a modified impulse test rig.

AB  - Lunar floor-fractured craters are a class of craters modified by post-impact mechanisms. They are defined by distinctive shallow floors that are convex or plate-like, sometimes with a wide floor moat bordering the wall region. Radial, concentric, and polygonal floor fractures suggest an endogenous process of modification. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for such deformations: viscous relaxation and spreading of a magma intrusion at depth below the crater. To test the second assumption and bring more constraints on the intrusion process, we develop a model for the dynamics of magma spreading below an elastic overlying layer with a crater-like topography. As predicted in earlier more qualitative studies, the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone prevents the intrusion from spreading laterally, leading to the thickening of the intrusion. Additionally, our model shows that the final crater floor appearance after the uplift, which can be convex or flat, with or without a circular moat bordering the wall zone, depends on the elastic thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion and on the crater size. Our model provides a simple formula to derive the elastic thickness of the overlying layer hence a minimum estimate for the intrusion depth. Finally, our model suggests that crust redistribution by cratering must have controlled magma ascent below most of these craters. Key Points A model for the dynamics of crater-centered intrusion is proposed Diverse floor appearances are obtained and correspond to observations The floor appearance depends on the intrusion overlying layer properties ©2014.

AB  - The nitric acid plant of a domestic petrochemical complex is designed to annually produce 56,400 metric tons (based on 100% nitric acid). In the present work, radial-flow spherical bed reactor (RFSBR) for selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides (NO(x)) from the stack of this plant was modelled and compared with the conventional radial-flow reactor (CRFR). Moreover, the proficiency of a radial-flow (water or nitrogen) membrane reactor was also compared with the CRFR which was found to be inefficient at identical process conditions. In the RFSBR, the space between the two concentric spheres is filled by a catalyst. A mathematical model, including conservation of mass has been developed to investigate the performance of the configurations. The model was checked against the CRFR in a nitric acid plant located at the domestic petrochemical complex. A good agreement was observed between the modelling results and the plant data. The effects of some important parameters such as pressure and temperature on NO(x) conversion were analysed. Results show 14% decrease in NO(x) emission annually in RFSBR compared with the CRFR, which is beneficial for the prevention of NO(x) emission, global warming and acid rain.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious time-loss injuries in football. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate risk factors of ACL injuries in high-level football players during the preseason. Thirty-five high-level players were captured by a video movement analysis system and a two-force platform. Frontal plane knee angle and vertical force were measured during the landing phase of the drop jump. Intraclass correlation coefficient was determined to assess test-retest reliability, and α level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There were significant differences between the stronger and weaker leg in eccentric (32.4 Ns; 95%. CI; 22.9-41.8 Ns; P<.05) and concentric impulse (14.4 Ns; 95%. CI, 9,8-19,1 Ns; P<.05). Additionally, 31.4% of the subjects obtained a lower limb strength imbalance higher than 15%. Furthermore, 14.2% of the subjects obtained a frontal plane knee valgus angle higher than 20°. Findings of the present study are particularly significant as a functional deficit higher than 15% and an increased in valgus motion at the knee suggests an altered muscular control of the lower extremity. Furthermore, results confirmed that the test proposed in this study is reliable and sensitive to identify ACL injury intrinsic risk factors in high level male football players in order to introduce the necessary preventive measures. © 2013 Consell Català de l'Esport.

AB  - A brief overview is given of the classification schemes and current terminology of Phanerozoic sedimentary iron deposits, particularly that of ironstones. Representative geological samples of oolitic ironstones (OIS) possibly used as raw materials for prehistoric red ochres have been petrographically investigated. Microfacies differences have been observed between Llanvirn OIS from Normandy (France), Famennian OIS from Belgium and Emsian-Eifelian OIS from the Eifel area (Germany). Petrographical differentiation is based upon contrasting grain size, mineralogy and typology of the ferruginous ooids, as well as differences in mineralogy, diagenetic history and lithologie nature of the host sediments or of the cement. Most conspicuous are the differences in ferruginous ooid typology, including "true" concentric ooids, superficial ooids, algal oncoids and pseudo-ooids (such as ferruginized cortoids and rounded bioclasts). "Flaxseed ore" facies and "fossil ore" facies can be identified, as well as transitional or mixed types. A selection of representative archeological objects (OIS) has been petrographically investigated as well: the first results point to a rather local provenance for the samples of Normandy and Hesbaye (Belgium).

AB  - In this paper we consider the multiparameter system introduced in [9], which corresponds to an extension of the classic minimal Daphnia-algae model. It is shown that there is a neighborhood in the parameter space where the system in the realistic quadrant has a unique equilibrium point which is a repelling weak focus of order four enclosed by a global attractor hyperbolic limit cycle. For a small enough change of the parameters in this neighborhood, bifurcation occurs from the weak focus four infinitesimal Hopf limit cycles (alternating the type of stability) such that the last bifurcated limit cycle is an attractor. Moreover, for certain values of parameters, we concluded that this applied model has five concentric limit cycles, three of them being stable hyperbolic limit cycles. This gives a positive answer to a question raised in [2, 4]. Copyright ©2014 Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if Fédération Internationale de Football Association's "The 11+" injury prevention program improves physical fitness and technical performance in youth futsal players. DESIGN: Randomized cohort study. SETTING: Futsal club. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six futsal players (17.3 ± 0.7 years). INTERVENTION: Players were randomized to an intervention group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 18). Intervention group performed "The 11+" twice per week for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Isokinetic testing to access maximal quadriceps (Q) and hamstring (H) strength, vertical jump (squat jump, SJ; countermovement jump, CMJ), 5-m and 30-m sprint, agility, slalom, and balance performances were also measured. RESULTS: Intervention group increased (P < 0.05) quadriceps concentric (14.7%-27.3%) and hamstrings concentric (9.3%-13.3%) and eccentric (12.7%) peak torque. Intervention group improved functional H:Q ratio by 1.8% to 8.5% (P < 0.05). Intervention group improved (P < 0.05) SJ (13.8%) and CMJ (9.9%) and 5-m and 30-m sprint (8.9% and 3.3%, respectively), agility (4.7%), and slalom (4.8%) performances. Intervention group also improved balance, by decreasing the number of falls by 30% in the nondominant limb. No changes were observed in control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 'The 11+' can be used as an effective conditioning means for improving physical fitness and technical performance of youth futsal players.

AB  - During a survey of birds from Argentina, two species of Digenea, one of them new, were found parasitizing the great antshrike, Taraba major (Vieillot) (Aves: Thamnophilidae). The strigeid, Strigea orbiculata sp. n. is characterized by having a body plump, a copulatory bursa without a membraneous fold ('Ringnapf'), entire testes, eggs with miracidia with eye-spots, by the arrangement of vitelline follicles in the forebody, which are densely distributed from its anterior edge, and by the absence of a neck region in the hindbody. Among the known Neotropical species of Strigea Abildgaard, 1790, only five share with Strigea orbiculata sp. n. the body shape and the distribution of vitelline follicles in the forebody: Strigea caluri Dubois, 1962, S. elliptica (Brandes, 1888), S. inflecta Lunaschi et Drago, 2012, S. nugax Szidat, 1928 and S. sphaerocephala (Westrumb, 1823 nec Brandes 1888). However, S. caluri can be easily distinguished by having a membraneous fold in the copulatory bursa originated from 'Ringnapf', and multilobed testes. Strigea elliptica differs mainly by having a well developed 'Ringnapf' and the remaining species differ principally by metrical characters. The dicrocoeliid, Lyperosomum oswaldoi (Travassos, 1919) is reported for the first time from Argentina and T. major represents its new definitive host. The host specificity of Neotropical Strigea spp. is discussed and an updated list of records of their hosts is provided. © Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre ASCR.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the training effects of an injury prevention programme on neuromuscular control, strength and performance in male amateur football players. Eighty-one players were allocated to the "FIFA 11+" (n = 42) or a control group (CON, n = 39). The "FIFA 11+" group performed the programme 3 times a week for 9 weeks; the control group completed the usual warm-up. Primary outcomes were: time-to-stabilisation test and eccentric/concentric flexors strength. Secondary outcomes were: eccentric/concentric extensors strength, star excursion balance test, core-stability test, vertical jump, sprint, and agility. After controlling for covariates, significant between-group differences after the intervention (in favour of the "FIFA 11+" players) were found for time-to-stabilisation (-2.8%, 90% confidence interval [CI] -4.4 to -1.2%) and core-stability (-8.9%, -14.6 to -3.1%). Differences were also found for eccentric (3.8%, 1.4 to 6.2%) and concentric flexors strength (3.2%, 0.6 to 5.9%) at 60° · s-1 but this difference was only possibly meaningful (62.4%) from a practical point of view. No substantial and/or significant differences were found for the other outcomes. Performing "FIFA 11+" for 9 weeks can improve neuromuscular control. Possible worthwhile differences were found for flexors strength but there were no substantial effects in the other performance measures. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Understanding the nature and extent of consumer networks in social media has been complicated by both their rapid adoption and their tendency to adapt and mutate as they have been deployed. Originally described as Web 2.0 technologies, social media appear to have shifted the locus of communicative power from brand owners, governments, and large media companies in favour of their audiences. Much has been claimed for social media marketing, but empirical studies are only recently starting to appear in leading journals, and in most cases concentrate on the role of brands, products, and services. This article presents the findings of a six-year virtual ethnography, one focused on the consumer, a study with the aim of gaining a preliminary understanding of this evolving phenomenon. It finds that social media contain sets of complex interpersonal relationships in both concentric networks and in ad hoc groupings. These networks function through multifaceted reciprocal displays in which products, services, and brands may have a role, but are more likely to be peripheral to other aspects of relationship building. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Two passive smart composite plates are fabricated using one and two PZT patches that are cheaper than the PZT wafer. The composite plate is fabricated in low temperature through the hand lay-up method to avoid PZT patch decoupling and wire spoiling. The locus of the impact point is identified using the output voltage to identify the impact location using one sensor. The output voltages of the sensors are analyzed to identify the impact location using two sensors. The locations of the impacts are determined based on the crossing points of two circles and the origin of an intended Cartesian coordinate system that is concentric with one of the sensors. This study proposes the impact location identification of the passive smart composite using the low-cost PZT patch PIC155 instead of common embedded materials (wafer and element piezoelectric). © 2013 M.

AB  - Junonia evarete Cramer is a fast-flying butterfly that perches on the ground with wings opened exhibiting four eyespots close to wing borders. These eyespots presumably function either to intimidate predators, like insectivorous birds, or to deflect bird attacks to less vital parts of the body. We assessed the form, frequency, and location of beak marks on the wings of wild butterflies in central Brazil during two not consecutive years. We found that almost 50% of males and 80% of females bore signals of predator attacks (wing tears), most of them consisting of partially or totally V-shaped forms apparently produced by birds. Males were significantly less attacked and showed a lower proportion of attacks on eyespots than females, suggesting they are better to escape bird attacks. In contrast, females were heavily attacked on eyespots. Eyespot tears in females were higher (and significant different) than expected by chance, indicating that birds do attempt to reach the eyespots when striking on these butterflies. Other comparisons involving the proportion of tears directed or not directed to eyespots in males and females are presented and discussed. © 2013 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - The paper describes a deterministic algorithm based on simple analytical equations for designing planar circular sparse array antennas where the positions and the dimensions of the radiating elements are jointly exploited and optimized. The proposed solution permits addressing one of the main limitations associated to sparse arrays, i.e., their poor aperture efficiency especially when patterns with low sidelobe levels are obtained using only the density of the elements avoiding any amplitude tapering. The accuracy of the method is guaranteed by the fact that the achieved directivity differs from the target value, associated to a continuous reference aperture distribution, by a quantity asymptotically equal to the factor π (corresponding to about - 1.05 dB) representing the filling factor of a circular planar array organized in concentric rings populated by circular apertures. As required for several applications, the method includes the possibility to add a constraint on the maximum scanning angle with respect to the boresight direction. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

The symptoms of the attacks are usually changed in color, bacterial spots, special kind of specks, and sunken areas with concentric rings having different colors on the tomato outer surface. This paper addresses a vision sensing based system for tomato quality inspection. A novel approach has been developed for tomato fruit detection and disease detection. Developed system consists of USB based camera module having 12.0 megapixel interfaced with ARM-9 processor. Zigbee module has been interfaced with developed system for wireless transmission from host system to PC based server for further processing. Algorithm development consists of three major steps, preprocessing steps like noise rejection, segmentation and scaling, classification and recognition, and automatic disease detection and classification. Tomato samples have been collected from local market and data acquisition has been performed for data base preparation and various processing steps. Developed system can detect as well as classify the various diseases in tomato samples. Various pattern recognition and soft computing techniques have been implemented for data analysis as well as different parameters prediction like shelf life of the tomato, quality index based on disease detection and classification, freshness detection, maturity index detection, and different suggestions for detected diseases. Results are validated with aroma sensing technique using commercial Alpha Mos 3000 system. Accuracy has been calculated from extracted results, which is around 92%. © 2014 Satyam Srivastava et al.

AB  - The aim of the study was to verify whether 8 weeks of resistance training employing maximal isokinetic eccentric (IERT) knee extensor actions would reduce the acute force loss observed after high-intensity treadmill running exercise. It was hypothesized that specific IERT would induce protective effects against muscle fatigue and ultrastructural damages, preventing or reducing the loss in mechanical muscle function after running. Subjects were tested before and after IERT protocol for maximal isometric, concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee extensor strength (60 and 180 s-1). In a second session, subjects performed treadmill running (~35 min) and the previously mentioned measurements were repeated immediately after running. Subsequently, subjects were randomized to training (n = 12) consisting of 24 sessions of maximal IERT knee extensors actions at 180 s-1, or served as controls (n = 8). The effects of acute running-induced fatigue and training on isokinetic and isometric peak torque, and rate of force development (RFD) were investigated. Before IERT, running-induced eccentric torque loss at 180 s-1 was -8 %, and RFD loss was -11 %. Longitudinal IERT led to reduced or absent acute running-induced losses in maximal IERT torque at 180 s-1 (+2 %), being significantly reduced compared to before IERT (p < 0.05), however, RFD loss remained at -11 % (p > 0.05). In conclusion, IERT yields a reduced strength loss after high-intensity running workouts, which may suggest a protective effect against fatigue and/or morphological damages. However, IERT may not avoid reductions in explosive muscle actions. In turn, this may allow more intense training sessions to be performed, facilitating the adaptive response to running training. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biological flesh is a medium for communication and expression that works on a microscopic scale. Ultra-thin membranes operate within an elaborate network of affiliations between their atomic computational logic and their context. As time advances, new discoveries force evolution to adjust its rules. Life, then, takes the form of animate bodies created “from the bottom up.” A scripted strategy works as a feedback loop, readjusting its own genetic material to find ecological equilibrium between itself and its surroundings. The architecture becomes a structural analog to the idea of life as an emergent field which develops in response to the fear of dying (thanataphobia). Growth or decay, lifting or peeling, pinching or folding, lubricity or plasticity-a topological blend of expressions works to unite and separate bodies. These concentric bodies grow by spinning, lifting, and dilating elliptical units, which then become the platform for generation of a bottom-up architecture, responsive and localized. © 2009 Evan Douglis, selection and editorial matter.

AB  - A flexible and accurate camera calibration algorithm with circles and concentric circle patterns is proposed for hand-held camera for multiview stereo (MVS) application, which can avoid user interaction for feature extraction in traditional planar pattern based camera calibration method. In order to automatically identify the features in image, we encode the circular patterns according to the size of the patterns. The unique code can be used to match features in images and planar patterns. We use three methods to extract the circle centers, e.g. ellipse fitting, perspective correction and circle chord midpoint approximation methods. Both simulation and real image data are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We use this method in multiview stereo(MVS) to reconstruct three visual hull models from image sequences. The experiments demonstrate that the concentric circle patterns have most accurate results. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The most favorable mechanical environment for the hip is one that is free of both instability and impingement, creating a concentric articulation with optimum femoral head coverage by the acetabulum. Anatomic variations such as acetabular dysplasia with associated instability, and femoroacetabular impingement with abnormal constraint, will lead to abnormal joint mechanics, articular damage, and osteoarthritis. Surgical techniques such as periacetabular osteotomies, and femoral and acetabular osteoplasties enable correction of anatomic variations that cause mechanical damage to the hip joint, thereby potentially preventing or delaying development of osteoarthritis and subsequent need for joint replacement. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A navigation and stabilization scheme for 3D heterogeneous (UAVs and UGVs) formations acting under a hawk-eye like relative localization is presented in this paper. We formulate a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based concept for formation driving in a leader-follower constellation into a required target region. The formation to target region problem in 3D is solved using the MPC methodology for both: i) the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader, and ii) the control and stabilization of followers - UAVs and UGVs. The core of the method lies in a novel avoidance function based on a model of the formation respecting requirements of the direct visibility between the team members in environment with obstacles, which is crucial for the hawk-eye localization. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Let Dx:= ∑i=1n ∂/∂ xi ei be the Euclidean Dirac operator in ℝn and let P(X) = am X m +... + a1 X + a0 be a polynomial with real coefficients. Differential equations of the form P(Dx)u(x) = 0 are called homogeneous polynomial Dirac equations with real coefficients. In this paper we treat Dirichlet type problems of the a slightly less general form P(Dx)u(x) = f(x) (where the roots are exclusively real) with prescribed boundary conditions that avoid blow-ups inside the domain. We set up analytic representation formulas for the solutions in terms of hypercomplex integral operators and give exact formulas for the integral kernels in the particular cases dealing with spherical and concentric annular domains. The Maxwell and the Klein-Gordon equation are included as special subcases in this context. © 2013 Springer Basel.

AB  - The animal world is full of brilliant colours and striking patterns that serve to hide individuals or attract the attention of others. False eyespots are pervasive across a variety of animal taxa and are among nature's most conspicuous markings. Understanding the adaptive significance of eyespots has long fascinated evolutionary ecologists. Here we show for the first time that the size of eyespots is plastic and increases upon exposure to predators. Associated with the growth of eyespots there is a corresponding reduction in growth of eyes in juvenile Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrusamboinensis. These morphological changes likely direct attacks away from the head region. Exposure to predators also induced changes in prey behaviour and morphology. Such changes could prevent or deter attacks and increase burst speed, aiding in escape. Damselfish exposed to predators had drastically higher survival suffering only 10% mortality while controls suffered 60% mortality 72 h after release.

AB  - As plaque develops in arteries two types of remodeling can occur; positive and negative remodeling. Positive remodeling is an outward compensatory remodeling in which the arterial wall grows outward in an attempt to maintain a constant lumen diameter, while negative remodeling is defined as a local shrinkage of vessel size. Sudden heart attacks remain one of the primary causes of premature death in the developed world. The role of positive remodeling in vulnerable plaque rupture mechanics, which could explain why many of these heart attacks occur without prior symptoms, is still debated. In this manuscript we present a numerical study of the role of vascular growth on plaque vulnerability. Plane strain finite element models of a coronary artery with positive and negative morphology have been compared by systematically varying the most influential values of the geometry of the vessel on plaque stresses: (i) the fibrous cap thickness, (ii) the stenosis ratio, (iii) the lipid core dimensions and (iv) the atheroma plaque distribution (eccentric or concentric). All models have been developed with the same average dimensions and material properties. Vessel wall stress concentrations were always predicted to be higher in the fibrous cap of atheroma plaques with positive morphology compared to those with negative morphology. Furthermore, our conclusions are independent of the fibrous cap and the degree of stenosis considered. These results may explain why plaque rupture is often apparent at sites with only modest luminal stenoses but marked positive remodeling. The results of this study support the hypothesis that coronary arteries with positive remodeling are more vulnerable to rupture than those arteries with negative remodeling for comparable geometrical conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As a category of special control points which can be automatically identified, artificial coded targets have been widely developed in the field of computer vision, photogrammetry, augmented reality, etc. In this study, a novel color coded target is designed for vision measurements. A reference position is defined to avoid the repeated coding as well as simplify the coding structure, and a pair of concentric circles is utilized for the precise location of the target. An edge-based identification and location algorithm is proposed for the designed coded target. In this algorithm, a coarse-fine strategy is employed to improve the efficiency and various judgments are made to ensure the correctness of the identification. No human involvement is required except for the adjustment of thresholds in the beginning, which is conducive to the automation of measurement. The algorithm shows high accuracy and robustness in experiments. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the move toward performance-based seismic design, controlled rocking steel braced frames show great potential because of their ability to avoid structural damage during large earthquakes. This paper describes performance objectives for these systems that are consistent with current codes, and it examines what hysteretic properties are needed to achieve these objectives by discussing the behavior of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems. Based on a series of 10, 164 SDOF analyses, it is shown that low-rise controlled rocking steel braced frames could be designed with slightly larger force reduction factors (R) than are currently codified for ductile concentrically braced frames, while taller frames could be designed only to avoid uplift under code-specified wind loads. However, this requires the frame members to be capacity designed with due consideration of higher mode effects, which cannot be properly assessed by applying an overstrength factor to the design lateral force distribution. These conclusions are validated with case studies of a two-story and a 12-story controlled rocking steel braced frame.

AB  - We have previously shown that the selective sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) antagonist S1RA (E-52862) inhibits neuropathic pain and activity-induced spinal sensitization in various pre-clinical pain models. In this study we characterized both the behavioral and the spinal neurochemical effects of S1RA in the rat formalin test. Systemic administration of S1RA produced a dose-related attenuation of flinching and lifting/licking behaviors in the formalin test. Neurochemical studies using concentric microdialysis in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of awake, freely moving rats revealed that the systemic S1RA-induced antinociceptive effect occurs concomitantly with an enhancement of noradrenaline levels and an attenuation of formalin-evoked glutamate release in the spinal dorsal horn. Intrathecal pre-treatment with idazoxan prevented the systemic S1RA antinociceptive effect, suggesting that the S1RA antinociception depends on the activation of spinal α2- adrenoceptors which, in turn, could induce an inhibition of formalin-evoked glutamate release. When administered locally, intrathecal S1RA inhibited only the flinching behavior, whereas intracerebroventricularly or intraplantarly injected also attenuated the lifting/licking behavior. These results suggest that S1RA supraspinally activates the descending noradrenergic pain inhibitory system, which may explain part of its antinociceptive properties in the formalin test; however, effects at other central and peripheral sites also account for the overall effect. © 2014 International Society for Neurochemistry.

AB  - Eyespots are conspicuous circular features found on the wings of several lepidopteran insects. Two prominent hypotheses have been put forth explaining their function in an antipredatory role. The deflection hypothesis posits that eyespots enhance survival in direct physical encounters with predators by deflecting attacks away from vital parts of the body, whereas the intimidation hypothesis posits that eyespots are advantageous by scaring away a potential predator before an attack. In the light of these two hypotheses, we investigated the evolution of eyespot size and its interaction with position and number within a phylogenetic context in a group of butterflies belonging to the genus Junonia. We found that larger eyespots tend to be found individually, rather than in serial dispositions. Larger size and conspicuousness make intimidating eyespots more effective, and thus, we suggest that our results support an intimidation function in some species of Junonia with solitary eyespots. Our results also show that smaller eyespots in Junonia are located closer to the wing margin, thus supporting predictions of the deflection hypothesis. The interplay between size, position, and arrangement of eyespots in relation to antipredation and possibly sexual selection, promises to be an interesting field of research in the future. Similarly, further comparative work on the evolution of absolute eyespot size in natural populations of other butterfly groups is needed. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Looking at H.P. Berlage's famous Plan Zuid ('South Plan') for Amsterdam by examining the notions that were used and are still being used to describe his design, we gain new insights into the design, into the notions themselves and into the way in which historic plans and their explanations are to be seen in their interrelatedness. From studying Berlage's Explanatory Memorandum it immediately becomes clear that the well-known plan that is usually depicted does not reflect the original design. In this presentation map of the Office of Public Works from 1917 the emphasis is on uniform buildings, leaving the public space in a unelaborated state. The original plan from March 1915 has a different focus with more attention to a detailed public space, including street profiles and directives for special buildings in special places. This plan is also more in line with the accompanying bird's-eye views and with Berlage's own writings on urbanism. By looking at the designed phenomena of the original plan (the referents), all of the notions from Berlage's Explanatory Memorandum have been examined, divided into three categories: public spaces, buildings and the city and its elements. Notions used by contemporaries were also looked at (synchronic) and a comparison was made with the present (diachronic). Berlage's design was based on a hierarchical street network, which he developed in profiles with different spatial characteristics defined at four levels: '(breede) verkeersweg'/'(broad) traffic road', 'straalvormige hoofdstraat'/'radial main street', 'ringvormige hoofdstraat'/'concentric main street' and 'woonstraat'/'domestic street'. The most conspicuous of these are the 60 m wide 'verkeerswegen'/'traffic roads' or 'Parkwegen'/'Parkways', which were already also called 'boulevards' or 'lanen'/'avenues' at the time. The notions of 'weg'/'road' and 'straat'/'street' were almost interchangeable in practice, as it turned out. For his few urban waterways Berlage consistently used the word 'gracht'/'canal'- which at the time was less associated with the urban profile-even though his contemporaries also used the more neutral word 'kanaal'/'waterway'. The remaining public spaces, such as 'park' and 'plein'/'square' were less important and also less interesting as notions. The housing consisted of three classes: 'ééngezinshuizen>/ 'single family houses', <tweegezinshuizen>/'two family houses' and <volksklassehuizen>/'working class houses'. In the latter two categories one 'huis'/'house' contained several 'woningen'/'apartments'. Various synonyms were used for these notions. By contrast, the many public buildings were designated in more unequivocal terms. Berlage also included 'bijzondere bebouwing'/ 'special buildings' with 'a certain monumentality' and he argued in favour of 'blokbouw'/'block building', a notion that could refer to 'building in closed blocks', but especially to 'building in large architectural units'. As to the city elements it is interesting to note that in Berlage's day the words 'wijk'/'quarter' and 'buurt'/'neighbourhood' were synonyms, whereas nowadays they indicate a difference in scale, possibly under the influence of modernist urbanism. The research into Plan Zuid has demonstrated that notions are always in flux. In terms of synchrony especially the partly overlapping notions are interesting, as are those notions about which there is no consensus yet. In terms of diachrony especially those notions stand out in which an almost imperceptible change in meaning has occurred. Those notions in particular have led to the general conclusion that in studying historic explanations of plans one must always consciously look at the contemporary meaning and the referents of the words that are used, if one is to interpret them correctly.

AB  - This article deals with concentrically braced frames that are prone to exhibit weak storey behavior in the case of a seismic event. After the introduction of the key features of seismic design of braced frames according to Eurocode 8 the causes of the weak storey behaviour are presented. This is followed by the description of new design criteria that aim to prevent the occurrence of weak stories. The suitability of the new method is proved by numerical examples.

AB  - Red-footed Falcons are gregarious trans-equatorial migrants, forming up to several thousand strong roost sites after the breeding season and before commencing migration. This pre-migration period is presumed to play a major role in defining the survival of long-range migrants. Here we investigate the autumn movements of 8 individuals caught and satellite-tagged within the Carpathian Basin. We found that birds may use multiple roost sites that can be separated by large distances. A single individual’s home range was 88 km2 (80% kernel home range) and was near concentrical to the roost site. Two individuals travelled to southern Ukraine soon after tag-deployment. Our results demonstrate that even a small number of satellite tagged birds show behavioural plasticity in terms of roost site selection indicating that post-breeding foraging habitat choice decisions may have substantial variability. The night localization points of birds marked out 2 and 5 yet unknown potential roost sites in Hungary and in the Ukraine, respectively. Using the data of an international weekly survey (2006–2011) carried out in the Carpathian Basin, we cross-referenced the departure dates of tagged individuals with the 6 year means of counted individuals. The tagged birds initiated migration with the first 25% percent of the surveyed population. © 2014, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hypothesis of satyric mimicry postulates that the colour patterns of an animal may make its identity ambiguous, and this ambiguity interferes with the process of perception in vertebrate predators for a sufficient time to allow the potential prey to take evasive action. It has now been found that eyespots and other designs on the wings of many insect species are often coupled with other wing patterns and designs. These composite images often closely resemble heads and bodies of vertebrates (including birds and reptiles) and of various invertebrates. Such images can be perceived in living insects, although only rarely in set specimens because of displacement of the components. Visual processing by non-mammalian vertebrates generally involves attention to detail, suggesting that, at least initially, and unlike humans, they perceive embedded images on insect wings and bodies and ignore the whole or Gestalt. They are therefore likely to be confused by the ambiguity of the potential prey. It can be calculated that a delay of the order of only tenths of a second in the attack on a stationary insect by a predator could result in failure of capture. It is proposed in the present review that the concept of satyric mimicry be extended to include complex imagery of other organisms. Such iconic images, which often represent toxic or dangerous animals, are particularly common amongst saturniid moths and nymphalid and danaid butterflies (including the Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus). © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - The sport of alpine ski racing requires relatively slow eccentric and concentric movements as compared with traditional field sports with course durations from 40 seconds to more than 2 minutes. controlling the ski snow contact and the ability to limit the dissipation of speed requires dynamic balance and eccentric movement through a wide range of lower limb and hip mobility. strength and conditioning should focus on hypertrophy, maximal strength, power, balance, dynamic mobility, and anaerobic metabolic support. the purpose of this article is to provide the necessary background for a strength coach to implement as much evidence-based coaching as possible for alpine ski racing.

AB  - Near field ground motions have caused several structural damages in recent decades. As a result, seismic codes are being updated with related requirements. In this paper a comparative study on the seismic behavior of concentrically braced frames (CBFs) designed based on different seismic codes is performed. Reliability of various frames with different heights and bracing types are analyzed based on the results of "Incremental Dynamic Analysis" (IDA) under near field ground motions. Fragility curves corresponding to IO (Immediate Occupancy) and CP (Collapse Prevention) limit states are extracted based on IDA curves. Results imply that, frames designed based on the near field seismic design criteria of UBC-97 are more reliable under near field ground motions and their failure probability is less comparing to others. © 2013 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the use of Buckling Restrained Brace systems (BRBs) in preventing the progressive collapse of the structural frame against fire is investigated using the stiffness reduction technique. Four-storey steel structures fitted with different bracing configurations were modelled using the Vulcan programme. For comparative purpose, the efficiency of BRBs in preventing the progressive collapse of the structure is compared with the Ordinary Concentrically Brace systems (OCBs) in the presence of edge and central bay fire exposures. In order to consider the effect of bracing member stiffness on the collapse prevention of the frame and to provide a comprehensive scheme of progressive collapse mechanism under fire condition, several cross sections of BRBs under different fire scenarios are considered. The results indicate that BRBs provide a higher global collapse temperature for the frame, owing to a greater stiffness and more symmetrical performance offered as compared to OCBs, and thus providing better progressive collapse resistance. Moreover, it is observed that BRBs are stiff enough to redistribute the sustained load by heated columns to adjacent members without any buckling occurrence in the bracing member, maintaining the stability of the whole frame through both heating and cooling phases of fire. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Viscous dampers were implemented in the seismic retrofit design of a building in a large industrial facility near Seattle, Washington. The retrofit of this late-1960's building was designed to meet the ASCE 41-06 Standard for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings' Basic Safety Objective (BSO), which consists of the dual performance goals of life safety in the BSE-1 event (seismic hazard with 10% probability of exceedence in 50 years) and collapse prevention in the BSE-2 event (seismic hazard with 2% probability of exceedence in 50 years). The four-story, 112' tall steel-framed building consists of three levels of nonductile concentrically braced frames above a thirty-seven foot tall unbraced (soft) story. Due to the manufacturing processes contained within the building, the retrofit design reduces but doesn't eliminate its soft-story configuration; viscous dampers will be located within the bottom story to reduce lateral displacement demands and minimize required foundation work. In addition to the installation of dampers and limited foundation work, connection strengthening was required within the braced frames and the roof trusses to meet the selected performance objective. Parametric studies verified superior performance of viscous dampers relative to that of similarly sized friction dampers. Building performance was validated through a non-linear response history analysis. The building site is located approximately 100 kilometers from the Cascadia Subduction Zone (9.0 Mw) and less than one kilometer from a 7.44 Mw crustal source. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis confirmed the significant contribution from each source and a total of ten earthquake records were selected and scaled to capture the range of seismic ground motions expected at the site. Vertical acceleration components were included for each record to predict the response of the long-span roof trusses. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Condition-dependent mate choice is thought to affect the strength and direction of sexual selection. Although there is ample evidence of this from studies that experimentally manipulate female condition, few studies to date have examined condition dependence of natural mate choice wherein females interact with a pool of available males. We examined mate assessment by free-living Pavo cristatus peafowl, focusing on 3 measures of the choosing female's condition: mass condition (scaled mass index), ectoparasite load, and white blood cell (WBC) count. Females with greater mass condition were more active on peacock leks, approaching and visiting males more often, and spending more time near the males they visited. Condition did not affect the total number of males visited or the probability that a female would visit a male that she had already approached. Peacock mating success is strongly correlated with the iridescent colors of the eyespots on their train, suggesting that color signals are a major focus of female choice. Here, we show that females in better condition (higher mass condition and lower WBC count) allocate a greater proportion of their visit time to the most iridescent males displaying on leks. Our results provide evidence of strong condition-dependent effects on female mate assessment and choice in the absence of experimentally induced stress. We suggest that condition-dependent mate choice may help maintain variation in sexually selected male color traits. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

AB  - Predation in estuarine systems is an important source of mortality for benthic organisms. In laboratory mesocosm experiments, we assessed the survival of bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus) of various sizes (10-19. mm, 20-29. mm, 30-39. mm, and 40-50. mm shell height; SH) as a function of female blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, predation as it varied with habitat (oyster shell, sand, Gracilaria spp.) and predator size (> 140. mm, ≤ 140. mm carapace width; CW) in a balanced two-by-three factorial design. Scallops of all sizes were afforded higher proportional survival with small female crabs (0.61, SE = 0.05) compared to that with large female crabs (0.36, SE = 0.05), and the proportion of scallops surviving was highest in oyster shell (0.61, SE = 0.08), as compared to the Gracilaria spp. and sand treatments, at 0.41 (SE = 0.06) and 0.42 (SE = 0.07), respectively. Subsequent field-tethering experiments conducted in the Lynnhaven River sub-estuary of the lower Chesapeake Bay further illustrated the effect of habitat on the survival of juvenile bay scallops (< 30. mm SH); survival after 48. h differed significantly by habitat and location, but not size, and there were no interactions. Proportional survival was significantly higher in Gracilaria spp. treatment (0.60, SE = 0.07) as compared to other habitats, and it was higher at Alanton's Cove (0.60, SE = 0.10) compared to other locations. Overall, scallop survival was low; however, transplanting scallops in structured substrates with protection against predation, such as oyster shell and Gracilaria spp., will likely increase the success of restoration efforts. © 2014 .

AB  - As a component of architectures, stone reliefs prevailing during the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220) were usually found in coffin chambers and ancestral temples. Although the stone reliefs represent stone carving techniques of the Han Dynasty (202BC-AD220), little information about these techniques were known. In this study, the digital microscope with 3D surface reconstruction based on extended depth of focus (EDF) technology was used to investigate tool marks of stone reliefs excavated at the Mausoleum of Cao Cao (AD155-AD220) at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD25-AD220). The tool marks analysis shows that different carving techniques were involved. The surface was ground by a rotary grinding tool. Small flat-head tool could be used to lower the background. Curved lines were engraved by an oblique attack technique and the burin was held at the angle of about 35° to the contact surface. Thin straight lines were engraved by an upright attack technique. Concentric circles were possibly engraved by the dragging action of a tool like ah-shaped compass. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the EDF technology provide a new effective approach for tool marks analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hermeuptychia intricata Grishin, sp. n. is described from the Brazos Bend State Park in Texas, United States, where it flies synchronously with Hermeuptychia sosybius (Fabricius, 1793). The two species differ strongly in both male and female genitalia and exhibit 3.5% difference in the COI barcode sequence of mitochondrial DNA. Setting such significant genitalic and genotypic differences aside, we were not able to find reliable wing pattern characters to tell a difference between the two species. This superficial similarity may explain why H. intricata, only distantly related to H. sosybius, has remained unnoticed until now, despite being widely distributed in the coastal plains from South Carolina to Texas, USA (and possibly to Costa Rica). Obscuring the presence of a cryptic species even further, wing patterns are variable in both butterflies and ventral eyespots vary from large to almost absent. To avoid confusion with the new species, neotype for Papilio sosybius Fabricius, 1793, a common butterfly that occurs across northeast US, is designated from Savannah, Georgia, USA. It secures the universally accepted traditional usage of this name. Furthermore, we find that DNA barcodes of Hermeuptychia specimens from the US, even those from extreme south Texas, are at least 4% different from those of H. hermes (Fabricius, 1775)-type local- ity Brazil: Rio de Janeiro-and suggest that the name H. hermes should not be used for USA populations, but rather reserved for the South American species. This conclusion is further supported by comparison of male genitalia. However, facies, genitalia and 2.1% different DNA barcodes set Hermeuptychia populations in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas apart from H. sosybius. These southern populations, also found in northeastern Mexico, are described here as Hermeuptychia hermybius Grishin, sp. n. (type locality Texas: Cameron County). While being phylogenetically closer to H. sosybius than to any other Hermeuptychia species, H. hermybius can usually be recognized by wing patterns, such as the size of eyespots and the shape of brown lines on hindwing. "Intricate Satyr" and "South Texas Satyr" are proposed as the English names for H. intricata and H. hermybius, respectively. © Qian Cong, Nick V. Grishin.

AB  - Reliable drug concentration measurements at the target site are increasingly demanded and can be achieved by microdialysis. The aim of this pilot study was to demonstrate the proof of principle of long-term subcutaneous microdialysis in humans. For long-term microdialysis, a special setting implementing both concentric and linear catheters has been developed ensuring good clinical practice compliance, tolerability, and convenience for participants and personnel. As a model compound, moderately lipophilic voriconazole was selected as a well-characterized drug in in vitro microdialysis experiments. Multiple in vivo relative recovery (RR) determinations for microdialysis were performed by retrodialysis during the entire study (n = 48 samples). Continuous microdialysis was successfully applied and well tolerated over 87 h in three adults for the first time. RR revealed low intra-individual (coefficient of variation (CV) = 4.4-12.5%) and inter-individual variability (CV = 4.3-12.5%) across all samples and catheters. Lower RR values were consistently determined for linear catheters. One catheter leakage was managed without an impact on the reliability of the RR values. Overall, RR values were calculated to be 73.3% (linear: CV = 18.5%, n = 23) and 84.9% (concentric: CV = 5.6%, n = 23). Long-term microdialysis application over almost 4 days was feasible by reliable multiple RR (proof of principle), well tolerated, and reduced the burden in humans avoiding several catheter insertions, thereby allowing to monitor concentration-time courses continuously. Moreover, a moderately lipophilic drug has been proven suitable for in vivo microdialysis, as previously suggested by in vitro microdialysis. © 2012 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

AB  - Thermal conductivity was determined by the method of stationary coaxial cylinders. The technique of measurement and experimental techniques are described. The measuring cell consists of two vertically arranged concentric nickel cylinders: the external is 140 mm in length, and the internal is 101.3 mm. To account for the influence of free ends, corrections were introduced. Installation is calibrated in argon of 99.998 vol. % purity. The discrepancy between the reference data did not exceed 1%. Before the experiment, the installation was evacuated to a pressure of (2 3) 10-2 Torr. To avoid a change in the composition of the mixture, filling of the measuring cell occurred from the liquid phase.

AB  - Landslides are considered as the third largest natural disasters of the world, which have resulted in serious negative impact on the socioeconomic development of mountainous or hilly regions in China. Assessing landslides risk and studying their spatial distribution patterns is not only the urgent need to effectively reduce the disaster loss, but also the compensation and improvement of the current existing research deficiencies on disaster prevention and mitigation on landslides. Based on the related theoretical researches on natural disaster risks, this paper quantitatively assesses the loss risk of the population and economy threatened by landslides over China in counties' scales, with an adjusting-to-local-conditions method of the conceptual model suggested by UNISDR in 2004. The data for landslide disaster records were collected from the local chronicles in more than 2000 counties in China and processed with the materials from website of the Data-Sharing Network of Earth System Science. The results were mapped and analyzed with GIS to explore the risks' spatial distribution patterns. Results show that, most of the southwest China, the east of northwest China, the west border of central China, the partial cities and counties in middle of east China and the hilly area in south of the Yangtze River are concentric areas of high loss risk of landslide hazard-Affected body in China. The highest loss risk of population in China reaches up to 35. 8 persons per thousand ones in some counties in an extremely large landslide disaster. The extreme annual personal loss risk reaches more than 30 persons in some areas while the annual economic loss risk of which reaches up to more than 10 million RMB with the highest loss risk of 5% of the GDP exposure when meet with one extremely large landslide disasters.

AB  - Although the histopathogenetic process of keratin pearls is still poorly understood, acceleration of keratinization in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells may represent one possible therapeutic avenue. Based on our histopathological observations, we have hypothesized that SCC cells are keratinized by phagocytosis of extravasated erythrocytes. To confirm this hypothesis, we firstly examined immature keratin pearls in oral carcinoma in situ (CIS) and mature ones in SCC by immunohistochemistry. Concentric dyskeratotic cells in CIS keratin pearls became positive for keratin (K) 10, K17, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), or protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a candidate regulator for hemophagocytosis. When ZK-1 cells, an SCC cell system, were incubated with human peripheral blood erythrocytes, or with crude and purified hemoglobins (Hbs), their erythro-hemophagocytotic activities were confirmed by immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence signals for K10, K17, and HO-1 were enhanced due to hemophagocytosis in time-dependent manners. mRNA expression levels for the three molecules were most enhanced by purified Hb, followed by crude Hb and erythrocytes. K17/K10 mRNA expression levels were more elevated when PAR-2 was activated in ZK-1 cells. The results indicated that immature and mature keratin pearls in CIS and SCC were generated by oxidative stresses derived from erythro-hemophagocytosis, which might mediate HO-1 expression and be regulated by PAR-2. Thus, hemorrhage from the rupture of blood vessels can be one of the triggers for keratin pearl formation in oral CIS and SCC. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A common problem for modern horizontal gravel pack operations is the development of an annular bridge that blocks the flow of gravel slurry and prevents formation of a complete pack. Causes of annular bridging include high-rate leakoff zones or swelling shale layers within the reservoir. Secondary flow path technologies enable slurry flow to bypass any annular bridge and complete the packing of an openhole annulus. Current secondary flow path technologies on the market either lack the flow configuration to extend farther than several hundred feet, or they add complicated makeup and running procedures to align and secure a secondary slurry flow path. A tube configuration has recently been developed to add redundancy to the flow path geometry as well as greatly increase the overall flow area, extending the effective packable length of the system. The 4 × 1 concentric tube design has been combined with an integral internal cross-coupling communication system, connecting tubes at each joint and adding no additional makeup time to the running procedure of conventional sand screens. This paper presents the results of full-scale gravel pack simulations with leakoff and an annular barrier. The prototype multi-path system was run horizontally inside a simulated 8'/2-in. open hole. Slurry flow, prepared using conventional proppant in a viscous carrier gel or with ultra-low density proppant, successfully bypassed the sand dune created by the leakoff zone and the solid annular barrier, reaching all void areas and creating a complete pack. By enabling slurry flow to bypass any annular bridge and reliably complete the packing of longer and longer horizontal intervals, secondary flow path technology promises to provide a reliable, low-cost solution for delivering failure-free gravel pack completions. Emerging technology in this field strives to simplify running procedure, extend functional length of secondary flow paths and reduce relative packing time.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a simulated soccer test on the functional hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (Hecc:Qcon) in female soccer players. Fourteen amateur players (age, 26.1±4.6 years; height, 168±12cm; body mass, 62.7±5.5kg; body fat, 23.7±2.2%) performed the modified Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (modified LIST). Isokinetic strength assessments of the hamstrings and quadriceps on the dominant and non-dominant legs at 120°/s were performed before and immediately after the modified LIST. Hecc:Qcon was calculated as the ratio of the peak eccentric torque of the hamstrings to the peak concentric torque of the quadriceps. A two-way univariate analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of time and leg dominance on Hecc:Qcon. The main results showed that the modified LIST led to a significant decrease in Hecc:Qcon in the dominant (-14.1%) and non-dominant legs (-8.0%) (P=0.02). However, this decrease was not significantly different between dominant and non-dominant legs (P=0.42). These results reflect a greater risk of hamstrings tears and ACL sprains at the end of soccer matches. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Many lepidopteran caterpillars appear to gain protection from insect-eating birds because they possess eyespots, a pair of conspicuous markings on the body generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator. Similarly, many caterpillars widen their anterior body segments when threatened, and this defensive posture may also deter attack because it emphasizes the caterpillar's eyes and/or allows the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely. Yet, given that this behaviour is not limited to caterpillars with eyespots, it is possible that the defensive posture may serve as a predator deterrent in itself. To disentangle the protective value of eyespots and widened anterior body segments, we created four types of artificial caterpillar in a 2×2 factorial design and deployed them on tree branches in the field where they were exposed to predation attempts by wild birds. The 'survivorship' of the artificial caterpillars was monitored over 90. h in six locations. We found a clear survival advantage for artificial prey with eyespots or a widened head shape. However, prey possessing both eyespots and a widened head did not survive longer than prey with either characteristic alone, suggesting that the traits did not act synergistically to deter attack. Interestingly though, only caterpillars in the eyespot-defensive posture treatment received more pecks directed towards the anterior 'head' region. Collectively, this study demonstrates clearly that caterpillars possessing either eyespots or widened anterior body segments are likely to experience reduced predation by wild birds, even at northern latitudes where there are relatively few arboreal snakes. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Bushings are very important parts of the electrical power supply. They are used as transformer bushings to allow the electrical connection from the transformer winding to external equipment like busbar or overhead lines or as wall bushings for bringing 'high voltage' through a wall. The design of bushings usually consists of an insulating body, for instance oil impregnated paper with concentrically inserted layers for electrical field grading or a gas chamber, a housing, usually porcelain or polymeric, and the flange. For testing of bushings it is necessary to simulate service conditions. This means oil vessels for transformer bushings and a special structure for wall bushings to simulate installation conditions are necessary. The performed electrical tests should verify that the bushing withstand the electrical stress in service. Challenges for testing bushings in the UHV range are the big dimensions of the test objects, avoiding any kind of external influences to the measuring results and the lack of relevant standards for the UHV range. This paper summarizes the experiences in testing AC and DC bushings up to 800 kV system voltages. Problems during the preparation process or during the tests which can occur and there possible solution will be shown. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Edge bias can result from the failure of sampling estimators to account for the true sampling probabilities of trees near the edges of a stand. Numerous estimators for basal area, each with an associated sampling method, have been proposed so as to avoid or reduce edge bias. The "walkthrough" estimator by Ducey et al. (2004) is easier to use than most competitors. A modification of that estimator is proposed here and referred to as the walk through and fro estimator. Along the line that connects the sample point and a particular sample tree, distances from the tree to any intersected stand boundaries are recorded if those distances are shorter than the radius of the conceptual tree-centered plot. The recorded distances are used to calculate sample weights that allow for unbiased estimation of basal area under all circumstances. The mean squared error for this estimator is generally less than that of the walk through estimator but greater than that of the tree-concentric estimator. Several variations on the proposed estimator are described. © 2013 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - The open field test is used to assess ambulation and anxiety; one way to assess anxiety is to compare ambulation in the center with ambulation in the periphery: the more anxious is the mouse, the less it moves in the center. The results of this report cast doubts on the generality of that rule, because they show that ambulation, both in the center and in the periphery, depends on the mouse strain and on the size of the open field; specifically, in a brightly lit open-field of moderate size (38 × 31 × 25 cm), ambulation in the center reflects anxiety in Balb/c mice, but not in C57Bl/6 mice. Yet, a large open-field (100 × 100 × 30 cm), receiving approximately the same amount of light as in the mouse room, allows assessment of anxiety and exploration-driven ambulation in both strains of mice. To do that, the author of this report proposes (i) to express ambulation in normalized scores (i.e., ambulation per surface unit) to verify that ambulation in the periphery is higher than ambulation in the center, (ii) to use an open field sufficiently large so that mice of any strain ambulate more in the periphery than in the center, and (iii) to measure ambulation in concentric strips of the open field and plot ambulation against the distance of the strips from the wall: it is proposed that the intercept of the line reflects explorationdriven ambulation whereas the slope reflects fear of leaving the wall. © 2014, Facultat de Psicologia Universitat de Barcelona.

AB  - Objective: To isokinetically record shoulder strength scores and range of motion in a professional rugby league squad. To prospectively monitor injuries over a season looking for associations between measured variables and injury. Design: A cohort study design involving prospective screening of risk factors with subsequent injury surveillance. Setting: University Sports Science Laboratory and Professional Rugby League Club. Participants: All players participating in the clubs reserve team squad for the 2011 season ( n=20). Main outcome measures: Concentric (Con) and eccentric (Ecc) peak torque values; ratio of Ecc internal rotation IR to Con external rotation ER, also known as the dynamic control ratio (DCR), shoulder range of IR and ER. Results: Eight players (36%) received a total of eleven injuries over the season. There were no statistically significant differences between injured and non-injured shoulders. IR range of movement was significantly lower in injured versus non-injured groups with left ( p=0.022) and right ( p=0.024). Left IR range of movement was predictive of injury using binary logistic regression ( p=0.046). No isokinetic strength parameters reached statistical significance ( p>0.05) for prediction of injury; however size effects were apparent for reduced con IR of the left shoulder and Ecc IR of both shoulders. Conclusion: Reduced shoulder IR range appears predictive of future shoulder injury although caution is drawn due to small participant numbers. Injury prevention strategies for rugby league players should include exercises to improve shoulder IR and possibly Ecc IR strength. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The latest issue of Current Steel Structures Research for the Engineering Journal focuses on a number of research projects at two French universities. These universities and their students are well known for their efforts throughout the world. Collapse Prevention of Low Durability Concentrically Braced Frames is such a collaborative research project undertaken by a number of professors from several American universities. This research project addresses the seismic performance of low-ductility steel braced frames designed with R = 3.0 and located in low and moderate seismic regions. The objectives of the project are to develop a fundamental understanding of the seismic performance of such structures. It is also essential to increase their reliability and resistance to seismic collapse by accounting for existing lateral capacity or to provide enhanced reserve capacity.

AB  - In this paper we propose a method for embedding binary data in triangular mesh models. Contrary to digital images and audio which benefit from the intrinsically ordered structure of the matrix and the array. 3D triangular mesh model lacks this capital property even though it can be encoded in an array date structure. Such a lack often complicates the different aspects of data embedding, like model traversal, data insertion, and synchronization. We address this problem with a mesh data representation which encodes the mesh data into a novel ordered structure, dubbed, the Ordered Rings Facets (ORF). This structure is composed of concentric rings in which the triangles are arranged in a circular fashion. This representation exhibits several interesting features that include a systematic traversing of the whole mesh model, simple mechanisms for avoiding the causality problem, and an efficient computation of the embedding distortion. Our method can be also adapted to different scenarios of data embedding, which includes stenography and fragile watermarking. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The experimental study to investigate the effect of the swirling annular airflow by swirler with guided vanes for flame behavior under the transitional regime on a double concentric bluff-body burner was conducted. Propane gas was employed as the fuel gas and the swirler of the five types was prepared. The result shows that the swirling component of airflow makes a grate contribution to improve the flame stability and suggests that the geometrical swirl number larger than 0.6 and airflow velocity which exceeds a certain value are need to improve the stability. However, the result of the visualization of the flames reveals that the spread airflow by centrifugal force, which is prevented from mixing with fuel, accompanies stabilized flame. The result gives a surmise that it is difficult for the present burner to combine the flame stability and the perfect combustion. © 2013 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - This letter shows how a longitudinally polarized hotspot can be created by a planar ultra-thin lens that beats the diffraction limit. On the imaging plane, a subwavelength optical resolution 0.39λ with almost purely longitudinal electric component has been demonstrated in air ambient. This novel paradigm addresses simultaneously both longitudinal polarization and deep sub-diffraction imaging, by a planar lens composed of ultra-thin opaque concentric annuli. The vectorial Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (VRS) approach, offering the advantage of significant reduction in computation, has been developed for a particular optimization of a flat lens with full control of polarization. Empowered by the robustness of VRS in dealing with polarization states, the proposed roadmap may be universally and efficiently integrated with other optimization algorithms to design super-resolution imaging with controlled polarization states at any wavelength without luminescence of the object. The lens, which is empowered by the proposed method, opens an avenue for the first time toward a highly integrated imaging system with advanced functionalities in far-field super-imaging, tailored polarization states and flat ultra-thin geometry simultaneously. © 2013 Astro Ltd.

AB  - In this work, three water-cooled experimental solidification devices were developed, and experiments were carried out with an Al-1.5wt%Fe alloy. The three experimental setups consist of vertical cylindrical steel molds with each of them having different zones cooled by water. For the inward solidification, a cooled tube is used having its upper and bottom part thermally insulated. For the outward solidification, a cooled tube, forming an inner part, is concentrically placed inside a cylindrical mold, which is thermally insulated from the environment, by using insulating materials. For the upward solidification, the bottom part of the mold is water-cooled and consists of a thin (3 mm) disc of carbon steel, whilst the cylindrical surface is covered with insulating material to avoid lateral heat losses. A numerical solidification model based on the finite difference method is applied for the simulation of the three aforementioned cases of solidification from the chilled surface considering transient heat flow conditions. Experimental thermal readings in the castings have been used for the determination of the transient overall metal/coolant heat transfer coefficient, h, through a numerical-experimental fit of casting thermal profiles based on inverse heat transfer calculations. It was found a significant variation of h as a function of time during solidification in the three cylindrical set-ups experimentally examined, including a remarkable increase in h during the outward solidification. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - This study describes and compares the diverse dorsal and ventral wing color patterns of Brassolini butterflies. Thirty-three species are illustrated, where pattern elements of the nymphalid ground plan are labeled in color. In general, a larger number of pattern elements can be identified on the ventral than on the dorsal surface of both wings, and the forewing has a larger number of discernible pattern elements than the hind wing. The dorsal elements are broad, diffuse, and more difficult to identify against the typically brown brassoline wing background color. Species with a light colored dorsal background served as a guide for our proposal that fewer pattern elements are present dorsally, particularly on the hind wing. Colorful bands or markings generally present on the dorsal surface seem to be associated with specific pattern elements and have correspondence to the ventral pattern. We refer to these as trailing bands, and they constitute a predominant feature of the brassoline dorsal coloration. We propose a subordinate groundplan for brassolines and interpret some of the ventral pattern variation in light of their phylogeny. Dorsal color pattern variation that leads to sexual dimorphism and mimetic resemblance are also discussed.

AB  - Organisms often evolve behaviours that increase or reinforce the protection from predators afforded by their morphological defences. For example, mimetic animals may adopt postures or locomotory behaviours that emulate a characteristic feature of their model to increase predator deception. Caterpillars with eyespots are thought to mimic snakes, and when threatened many of these caterpillars adopt a posture that appears to enhance this resemblance. Herein we evaluate the quantitative strength of evidence of behavioural mimicry in the caterpillars of 14 species by comparing how closely a series of putative snake-mimicking caterpillars resemble snakes while at rest and when threatened. Specifically, we quantified the head morphology and eye position of a range of snake species, as well as the shape of the apparent head (i.e. anterior body segments) and position of eyespots in caterpillars resting or in their defensive posture. This allowed us to objectively examine evidence for an increased resemblance to either snakes generally, or to Viperidae snakes specifically, upon adopting the defensive posture. Widening the anterior body segments during the defensive posture typically made caterpillars appear more viper-like as opposed to more snake-like in general. Enhanced resemblance to vipers upon mounting the defensive posture was apparent only from the dorsal view. Laterally, caterpillars more closely resembled snakes in the resting posture and shifting to the defensive posture instead reduced mimetic fidelity. Overall we found evidence for behavioural mimicry in all 14 species examined. We highlight that objectively quantifying mimetic fidelity can help identify key features involved in deception. © 2014 Current Zoology.

AB  - The X-ray baffle is an important part of the eROSITA mirror assembly as it reduces the stray light caused by single reflections at the Wolter 1 Mirrors by more than 90%. The stray light problem and possible solutions were analyzed by ray-tracing resulting in a trade-off between effective stray light protection and avoidance of vignetting. Possible design alternatives were considered and the influences of manufacturing tolerances were studied. Other than for XMM, the eROSITA X-ray baffle could not be realized as sieve plates; instead a system of co-aligned baffle rings was mounted onto each of the mirror modules. The mechanical design is based on concentric Invar foils fixed by an own spider. The complete X-ray baffles were finally mounted to the mirror module while the alignment was controlled by optical means. © 2014 SPIE.

AB  - Multitier concentrically braced frames (MTCBFs) are often employed as the lateral force-resisting system in structures where a tall, single story is required. To create an MTCBF, a braced frame is subdivided into a series of tiers with intermediate struts. Out-of-plane bracing is not provided at the tier levels, however. Prior studies on the seismic behavior of MTCBFs demonstrated that frames designed according to contemporary seismic provisions are susceptible to inelastic drift concentration within a single tier. Concentration of inelastic drift may lead to brace fracture and in-plane flexural yielding of the columns. In this study, three-dimensional finite element models of full MTCBFs were used to investigate their seismic behavior. Results from static pushover and nonlinear response history analyses revealed that the gusset plate connections at the tier levels aid MTCBFs in preventing inelastic drift concentrations and flexural yielding in the columns. Nevertheless, refinements to existing seismic design provisions appear necessary since excessive panel drifts were observed. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A hydrodynamic-rolling hybrid bearing (HRHB) arranged in parallel is introduced, in which the radial clearance of rolling bearing is used to prevent the rotor and hydrodynamic bearing from contacting during starts and stops. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rolling bearing misalignment on performance of HRHB for providing a design guide of machining and assembling tolerance. An analytic model is developed to predict the static performance of HRHBs with a misalignment. The misalignment is represented as an offset and an include angle. Taking the misalignment into account, a force balance equation about oil film force, rolling bearing reaction and external load is derived. The effects of the misalignment on the locus of equilibrium position, the maximum eccentricity, and the transition speed are investigated. The results show that misalignment has significant influences on performance of HRHBs, but there are regions of included angle which are insensitive to the performance of HRHBs; according to the insensitive regions, requirement of alignment errors, machining and concentricity tolerance can be determined; distinct from conventional hydrodynamic bearings, the locus of equilibrium positions of misaligned HRHBs have three variation modes of monotone decreasing, monotone increasing, and increasing first and decreasing afterwards; the monotone decreasing mode of conventional hydrodynamic is not suitable for HRHBs below transition speed; and before the maximum eccentricity ratio, the variation mode of equilibrium positions locus should be determined.

AB  - Each of the multicolored eyespots (ocelli) on the peacock's (Pavo cristatus) train is a complex structure with a purple-black center surrounded by concentric blue-green and bronze-gold regions. To investigate the influence of all 3 of these colors on male mating success, we used a physiological model of peafowl vision to quantify those colors as females would perceive them during male courtship displays. Males display at about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth (on average) with the female directly in front, so we investigated how colors would be perceived when illuminated at 30°, 45°, and 60° to the right of a female observer. We studied 34 males displaying at leks in 3 feral populations and quantified their copulation success and the colors of their eyespots. Eyespot coloration explained half of the observed variation in peacock mating success, with the hue and iridescence of the blue-green patch being the most important color variables. When we experimentally masked ocelli on 9 males, their copulation success declined almost to 0, supporting the idea that the eyespots are a major focus of female attention and not a trait that is simply correlated with something else that influences female choice. Thus, our study shows that the blue-green eyespot color overwhelmingly influences peacock mating success. The influence of the other eyespot colors on male success is minimal at best, raising questions about their function. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

AB  - Steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are used widely as a seismic lateral force-resisting system. Although modern CBFs designed for high seismic regions have considerable ductility, CBFs in moderate seismic regions are expected to have limited ductility, even when designed using modern provisions. In addition, older CBFs in high seismic regions also are expected to have limited ductility. In these low-ductility systems, reserve capacity (i.e., secondary strength and stiffness) plays an important role in seismic collapse prevention. Thus, quantifying the impact of reserve capacity on earthquake response for low-ductility systems is critical. This paper presents research that used single-degree-of-freedom systems to represent low-ductility CBFs, where brace fracture causes a sudden loss of strength and stiffness. Postbrace fracture stability was studied by considering variations in reserve system strength and stiffness parameters. Performance was evaluated by considering local ductility demands on the reserve system and global drift demands. For the cases considered, the ductility capacity of the reserve system was typically a more critical constraint than global drift capacity. Reserve capacity is demonstrated to appreciably influence seismic collapse behavior, whereas primary system strength has a small influence. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - We have previously shown that the cell sorting process of animal pole cells (AC) and vegetal pole cells (VC) from Xenopus gastrulae is considered to involve two steps: concentrification and polarization. In this study, we addressed the question of what specified the spatial relationship of the AC and VC clusters during the process. First, we examined the inhibitory or facilitatory treatment for myosin 2 activity during each of the two steps. The aggregates treated with Y27632 or blebbistatin during the concentrification step showed a cluster random arrangement, suggesting the prevention of the cell sorting by inhibition of myosin 2. Meanwhile, the treatment with a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, during the same step resulted in promotion of the fusion of the AC clusters and the progression of the cell sorting, presumably by an indirect activation of myosin 2. On the other hand, the treatments with any of the three drugs during the polarization step showed that the two clusters did not appose, and their array remained concentric. Thus, the modulation of cell contraction might be indispensable to each of the two steps. Next, the activin/nodal TGF-β signaling was perturbed by using a specific activin receptor-like kinase inhibitor, SB431542. The results revealed a bimodal participation of the activin/nodal TGF-β signaling, i.e., suppressive and promotive effects on the concentrification and the polarization, respectively. Thus, the present in vitro system, which permits not only the cell contraction-mediated cell sorting but also the TGF-β-directed mesodermal induction such as cartilage formation, may fairly reflect the embryogenesis in vivo. © 2013 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Lockne is a concentric impact structure due to a layered target where weak sediments and seawater covered a crystalline basement. A matrix-supported, sedimentary breccia is interlayered between the crystalline breccia lens and the resurge deposits in the crater infill. As the breccia is significantly different from the direct impact breccia and the resurge deposit, we propose a separate unit name, Tramsta Breccia, based on the type locality (i.e., the LOC02 drilling at Tramsta). We use granulometry and a novel matrix line-log method to characterize the sedimentology of the Tramsta Breccia. The obliquity of impact combined with the layered target caused an asymmetric, concentric transient crater, which upon its collapse controlled the deposition of the breccia. On the wide-brimmed downrange side of the crater where the sedimentary target succession was removed during crater excavation, wide, overturned basement crater ejecta flaps prevented any slumping of exterior sediments. Instead, the sediments most likely originated from the uprange side where the brim was narrow and the basement crater rim was poorly developed, sediment-rich, and relatively unstable. Here, the water cavity wall remained in closer proximity to the basement crater and, aided by the pressure of the collapsing water wall, unconsolidated black mud would flow back into the crater. The absence of interlayered resurge deposits in the Tramsta Breccia and the evidence for reworking at the contact between the overlying resurge deposits and the Tramsta Breccia indicate that the slumping was a rapid process (<75 s) terminating well before the resurge entered the crater. © The Meteoritical Society, 2013.

AB  - The study investigates the effects of the 11+ and HarmoKnee injury prevention programmes on knee strength in male soccer players. Under-21-year-old players (n=36) were divided equally into: the 11+, HarmoKnee and control groups. The programmes were performed for 24 sessions (20-25 min each). The hamstrings and quadriceps strength were measured bilaterally at 60°·s-1, 180°·s-1 and 300°·s-1. The concentric quadriceps peak torque (PT) of the 11+ increased by 27.7% at 300°·s-1 in the dominant leg (p<0.05). The concentric quadriceps PT of HarmoKnee increased by 36.6%, 36.2% and 28% in the dominant leg, and by 31.3%, 31.7% and 20.05% at 60°·s-1, 180°·s-1 and 300°·s-1 in the non-dominant leg respectively. In the 11+ group the concentric hamstring PT increased by 22%, 21.4% and 22.1% at 60°·s-1, 180°·s-1 and 300°·s-1, respectively in the dominant leg, and by 22.3%, and 15.7% at 60°·s-1 and 180°·s-1, in the non-dominant leg. In the HarmoKnee group the hamstrings in the dominant leg showed an increase in PT by 32.5%, 31.3% and 14.3% at 60°·s-1, 180°·s-1 and 300°·s-1, and in the non-dominant leg hamstrings PT increased by 21.1% and 19.3% at 60°·s-1 and 180°·s-1 respectively. The concentric hamstrings strength was significantly different between the 11+ and control groups in the dominant (p=0.01) and non-dominant legs (p=0.02). The HarmoKnee programme enhanced the concentric strength of quadriceps. The 11+ and HarmoKnee programmes are useful warm-up protocols for improving concentric hamstring strength in young professional male soccer players. The 11+ programme is more advantageous for its greater concentric hamstring strength improvement compared to the HarmoKnee programme.

AB  - Numerical simulation of damage and collapse mechanisms suffered by engineering structures can be an effective tool for a quantitative assessment of their causes. Large displacement inelastic analysis may be required in the case of highly flexible structures, such as steel roofs, which frequently experience large failures or even collapse because of buckling. This paper discusses the collapse of a long-span steel roof structure, which fell down suddenly during construction as a result of an out-of-plane buckling phenomenon induced by a gust of wind. Forensic investigations were carried out on behalf of the judicial authority to identify the causes of the accident. Based on detailed information gathered from site surveys and project documents, a three-dimensional numerical model of the as-built structure was created, and buckling analyses were performed to assess the safety level at the moment of the collapse. The as-built structure was braced through some purlins and steel cables fixed at the ground level. Structural stability was also investigated under further modeling assumptions to compare the effectiveness of several bracing systems in preventing the collapse. Analysis results showed that the as-built structure was in an unstable equilibrium condition when the wind breeze occurred. Temporary bracing elements installed on the structure instead of concentric roof braces were not sufficient to ensure the overall stability. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Accurate, reliable and fast numerical modeling methods are required to design the optimum radial refractive index profile for single and multimode fibers to give specific dispersion characteristics prior to or even obviating costly experimental work. Such profiles include graded index and multiple concentric cladding layers. In this paper, a new numerical method is introduced which enables the derivatives of the propagation coefficient to be calculated analytically up to the third order of a single mode or multimode weakly guiding optical fiber with an arbitrary radial refractive index profile. These quantities are required to determine the group delay, τg, chromatic dispersion, D, and dispersion slope of the fiber. The expansion of the modal fields in terms of Laguerre-Gauss polynomials in the Galerkin method offers certain benefits. In particular, due to simplicity of the basis functions it is possible to carry out further analytical work on the results such as repeated differentiation of the matrix equation resulting from the Galerkin method to define up to the third-order derivatives of the propagation coefficients with respect to wavelength. This avoids approximation errors inherent in numerical differentiation, giving better accuracy and, at the same time, significantly reduces the computation time. A computer program was developed to demonstrate the proposed method for single and multimode fibers with radially arbitrary refractive index profiles. The paper provides simulation results to validate the approach. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

AB  - Objective: Underage alcohol compliance checks conducted by law enforcement agencies can reduce the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales at checked alcohol establishments, and theory suggests that an alcohol establishment that is checked may warn nearby establishments that compliance checks are being conducted in the area. In this study, we examined whether the effects of compliance checks diffuse to neighboring establishments. Method: We used data from the Complying with the Minimum Drinking Age trial, which included more than 2,000 compliance checks conducted at more than 900 alcohol establishments. The primary outcome was the sale of alcohol to a pseudo-underage buyer without the need for age identification. A multilevel logistic regression was used to model the effect of a compliance check at each establishment as well as the effect of compliance checks at neighboring establishments within 500 m (stratified into four equal-radius concentric rings), after buyer, license, establishment, and community-level variables were controlled for. Results: We observed a decrease in the likelihood of establishments selling alcohol to underage youth after they had been checked by law enforcement, but these effects quickly decayed over time. Establishments that had a close neighbor (within 125 m) checked in the past 90 days were also less likely to sell alcohol to young-appearing buyers. The spatial effect of compliance checks on other establishments decayed rapidly with increasing distance. Conclusions: Results confirm the hypothesis that the effects of police compliance checks do spill over to neighboring establishments. These findings have implications for the development of an optimal schedule of police compliance checks.

AB  - The pathophysiologic origins of heart failure can be attributed to a pathologie remodeling of myocardium, including necrotic loss of cardiomyocytes and consequent reparative fibrosis. Hypertensive heart disease with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis represents a major etiologic factor accounting for diastolic heart failure. Herein, we focus on molecular mechanisms to the precursor of fibrosis, namely, cardiomyocyte necrosis, whose pathogenic origin resides in a mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway. Its major components include intracellular Ca2+ overloading of cytosolic and mitochondrial domains, the induction of oxidative stress by these organelles which overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses, and the increased opening potential of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Novel cardioprotective strategies aimed at preventing the progressive remodeling of the failing heart should target upstream molecular mechanisms that prevent cardiomyocyte necrosis rather than downstream events involving collagen turnover related to fibrosis. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Animals often respond fearfully when encountering eyes or eye-like shapes. Although gaze aversion has been documented in mammals when avoiding group-member conflict, the importance of eye coloration during interactions between conspecifics has yet to be examined in non-primate species. Jackdaws (Corvus monedula) have near-white irides, which are conspicuous against their dark feathers and visible when seen from outside the cavities where they nest. Because jackdaws compete for nest sites, their conspicuous eyes may act as a warning signal to indicate that a nest is occupied and deter intrusions by conspecifics. We tested whether jackdaws' pale irides serve as a deterrent to prospecting conspecifics by comparing prospectors' behaviour towards nestboxes displaying images with bright eyes (BEs) only, a jackdaw face with natural BEs, or a jackdaw face with dark eyes. The jackdaw face with BEs was most effective in deterring birds from making contact with nest-boxes, whereas both BE conditions reduced the amount of time jackdaws spent in proximity to the image. We suggest BEs in jackdaws may function to prevent conspecific competitors from approaching occupied nest sites. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - This paper focuses on investigation of a new seismic rehabilitation method to mitigate soft-story failures in deficient, multi-story, steel, concentrically braced frames (CBFs). The considered method consists of a sufficiently stiff rocking core (RC) that is pinned to the foundation and connected to an existing deficient CBF building to re-distribute seismic forces along its height, creating more uniform inter-story drift and ductility demand distributions. Two benchmark steel CBF buildings - including one 3-story and one 6-story - designed for Los Angeles, California, were selected and retrofitted using the considered method. Nonlinear static pushover analyses were conducted to demonstrate the beneficial contribution of RC in mitigating non-uniform, inter-story, drift distribution. It is shown that the RC is effective in reducing inter-story drift concentration in both buildings when they reach the maximum inter-story drift limits associated with collapse prevention, lift safety and immediate occupancy recommended in FEMA 356 for performance-based seismic design. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Peacock feather is one of the typical cases with structural colors. In the present article, we found that flamboyant colors in the "eye spot" of male peacock came from photonic crystal structure by observing the surface texture with SEM and reflectance spectrum with fiber spectrometer, and different color regions correspond to various structure cycles and surface appearances of the microstructure. The reflectance spectrum showed that the location of reflective peak shifted with the changes in the incident angles. The theory that the color is caused by microstructure was verified by the phenomenon that reflective peak exhibited red-shift with the time-varying after soaking in isopropyl alcohol. This study paves the way for fabricating functional composite materials with peacock feather-like photonic crystal structure.

AB  - To protect authorized digital images from illegal use, image copy detection is very important for copyright protection. Its key issue is to extract robust feature to detect images with variety of attacks. In this study, a robust algorithm based on a similar-sector model and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is proposed. An image is first divided by 48 concentric ellipses and 48 similar-sectors as the similar-sector model does, then ID DFT magnitude spectrum which is obtained from the pixel gray values in each elliptical ring, is used as our image feature for copy detection. Our feature is not only robust to various signal modifications but also to geometric distorüons. At last, the correlaüon coefficient is calculated to measure the similarity between the test image and the original image. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods and performs particularly well on detecting geometric distorted images, for instance, it can detect the image which is scaled, cut or rotated to any degree. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Informaction.

AB  - Recent studies have reported conflicting evidence for the influence of train-feather eyespots on the mating success of peacocks, Pavo cristatus. In this study we address this controversy, using observation and experiment to evaluate the effect of train morphology and the number of eyespots displayed during courtship on female choice. We show first that the maximum number of eyespots in the train is consistent among adult peacocks in feral populations at about 165-170 eyespots, and that most of the observed variation in eyespot number appears to be due to feather breakage or loss. Although we confirm a previous report that removing a large number (≥20) of the outermost eyespots from a male's train decreases his mating success compared to unmanipulated males, this experimental modification produces an ornament that is outside the range of eyespot number typically displayed during courtship. Thus, the considerable variation in the mating success of feral peacocks cannot be explained by natural variation in the number of eyespots visible in the train. Peafowl mate choice is clearly more complex than previously thought: females may reject a few males with substantially reduced eyespot number, while using some other cue to choose among males with typical trains. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - To achieve a dispersion-compensation photonic crystal fiber with an ultralarge negative chromatic dispersion coefficient, this paper theoretically investigates a liquid-filled hybrid structure of dual-concentric core photonic crystal fiber (DCC-PCF) and depressed-clad photonic crystal fiber (DeC-PCF). The proposed hybrid structure reveals an important property: The design can avoid the restriction of mutual involvement between two supermodes, thereby significantly increasing the index slope difference between two supermodes. Ultimately, the negative chromatic dispersion coefficient is greatly enlarged. The numeric results indicate that the negative chromatic dispersion coefficient for the proposed hybrid dispersion-compensating PCFs is up to -40400 ps/(km - nm) at a wavelength of around 1.55 μm, which is approximately 1.81 times larger than that of the previous structure. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

AB  - The coaxial two-mirror telescope consists of two mirrors facing each other. Classical two-mirror arrangements are Gregorian and Cassegrain. These systems are usually applied to space telescopes and often have optical baffles to prevent stray light from entering the focal plane. The optical baffles consist of concentric rings suspended between the secondary and the primary mirror. The secondary baffle for a large two-mirror optical system is designed and analyzed in this paper. According to mission of a telescope, the structure should have high stiffness and high reliability and light weight. Compared with invar, aluminum alloy and titanium alloy, carbon fiber composite is currently the best material in terms of weight-to-strength ratio. It also has advantages of high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. So carbon fiber composite is chosen as material to meet requirements of the coaxial telescope. In this paper, optimization method based on finite element analysis (FEA) is used for design the secondary baffle. Minimum weight of the baffle is chosen as an objective function. Thicknesses of former tube and vanes are chosen as variables. Analysis results show that the designed secondary baffle has maximum diameter of 180mm, total length of 120mm and weighs 142g. And its fundamental frequency reaches 651Hz. Therefore the baffle has many advantages, such as ultra-light weight, high stiffness and dimensional stability, etc. The optimization method and the baffle design can be helpful to other coaxial telescopes, such as Cassegrain, Gregorian and their subdivisions. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The determination of color patterns of butterfly wing eyespots has been explained by the morphogen concentration gradient model. The induction model has been proposed recently as a more realistic alternative, in which the eyespot-specifying signal does not depend entirely on focal activity. However, this model requires further elaboration and supporting evidence to be validated. Here, I examined various color patterns of nymphalid butterflies to propose the mechanics of the induction model. Based on cases in which an eyespot light ring is identical to the background in color, I propose that eyespots are fundamentally composed of dark rings and non-dark "background" spaces between them. In the induction model, the dark-ring-inducing signal that is released from a prospective eyespot focus (the primary organizing center) as a slow-moving wave effects both selfenhancement and peripheral induction of the dark-ring-inhibitory signal at the secondary organizing centers, resulting in an eyespot that has alternate dark and light rings. Moreover, there are cases in which an unseen "imaginary light ring" surrounds an eyespot proper and in which PFEs are integrated into the eyespot. It appears that PFEs constitute a periodic continuum of eyespot dark rings; thus, a background space between the eyespot and a PFE is mechanistically equivalent to eyespot light rings. The eyespot dark-ring-inducing signals and PFE-indu ing signal are likely to be identical in quality, but released at different times from the same organizing center. Computer simulations based on the reaction-diffusion system support the feasibility of the induction model. © 2011 Zoological Society of Japan.

AB  - The flexure bearings are one of the key components with long life, high reliable stirling cryocoolers for the aerospace use. The large radial stiffness of the spring provides a support for piston to ensure it works in a non-contact way with cylinder. The small axial stiffness of the flexure bearing ensures the piston working freely in the cylinder. The largest axial displacement is limited by the material fatigue limit restrictions. Because of the absence of the piston ring, the seal between the cylinder and the back volume is pressurized by the clearance gap, thus improving the piston and cylinder assembly technology. In this paper, three common flexure bearings including concentric flexure bearings, eccentric flexure bearings and linear arm flexure bearings are analyzed by FEM software. By changing the load, the thickness and the width of flexure bearing, the three types of plate spring are solved, and results of stress and displacement contours are shown. By using the modal analysis, the natural frequency is obtained to avoid the resonance nature frequency of spring. Analysis results show that on the same basic structure, the linear arm flexure bearings provide the largest axial and radial stiffness and the highest natural frequency, thus it is conductive to the lightweight of the whole cryocooler system in aerospace use.

AB  - In this paper, free convection heat transfer between two elliptical cylinders having different elliptical ratios in blunt and slender situations was studied experimentally. Three pairs of elliptical cylinders having the same radius ratio of 2.0, the same surface area and different elliptical ratios of 0.662, 0.866 and 0.968 were cut using the computed numerically controlled wire-cut machining. The tests were carried out by keeping a constant heat flux on the inner cylinder while cooling the outer one to be isothermal. The effects of vertical eccentricity, lateral eccentricity, angle of attack of the inner cylinder on natural convection for both blunt and slender situations of each pair were investigated. Empirical correlation was deduced within an acceptable uncertainty for the experimental results. Compatible and satisfactory to the conscience agreement was found in the comparison among the results of present and previous works. In the vision of the comparison, it was found that; the vertical eccentricity can enhance free convection by about 15% than the concentric case, the horizontal eccentricity can enhance natural convection by about 10% than concentric case and slender situation offers about 40% enhancement in free convection than the blunt situation for the same elliptical ratio. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knee muscles power using isokinetic in a population of young soccer players. To investigate the relationships between isokinetic peak torque and each player's position in the playground. Population and methods: Thirty-eight young soccer players (mean age 14.57 years old with extremes ranging from 13 to 17 years old) underwent an isokinetic assessment on both knees on an isokinetic dynamometer Cybex-NORM™ on three angular velocities: 60 °/s, 180 °/s and 240 °/s concentric mode. The peak torque, the peak torque on the weight and the ratio of hamstring/quadriceps were noted. These athletes were divided into three groups: strikers (16), defenders (16), and goalkeepers (6). Results: Hamstring/quadriceps ratio was at low speed 60 °/s between 72 and 74%, at medium speed (180 °/s) between 78 and 80%, and high speed (240 °/s) between 85 and 90%, the peak torque by extensor muscles weight was around 2.6 N. m/kg. Overall, there was no significant difference between the three groups of players; there were no significant difference between the dominant side and the non dominant side. Conclusion: There was no significant difference of the isokinetic peak torque between the players, no difference between agonist and antagonist muscles activity in isometric knee strength and no difference between the dominant side and the non dominant side. The isokinetic is a method for the assessment of the force and preventing muscle injuries of the knee. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Although General Didactics (GD) and Instructional Design (ID) have not shown many points of contact in the past, there are some obvious parellels from the perspective of their historical development. This will be examined in detail in this article. More specifically, we speak about model building, which has characterized General Didactics and Instructional Design for some decades. However, the models of General Didactics and Instructional Design are not problem-free with regard to the continuity and advancement of both disciplines. First, we will describe the historical roots of both disciplines and examine which elements of theory are of central importance. Second, we will try to answer the question of which kind of model building could be considered as predominant and what problems result from this predominance. In order to do this, we will describe empirical studies on the use of instructional models and discuss these studies from the perspective of the philosophy of science. Third, we will draw inferences for future processes of model building in order to prevent the same problems that happened in the past from happening again. Finally, we will discuss the issue of what General Didactics can learn from Instructional Design and vice versa. © 2012 Zierer and Seel.

AB  - Development and diversification of directional drilling tools continues, as do the applications in which they operate. As a result, there is continual demand for development and refinement of drill bits and string tools to meet the latest challenges and issues faced. One such challenge is the ability to reliably deliver consistent directional performance in very soft formation applications. Issues such as hole washout, inappropriate drilling parameters, stabilization, and hole quality can all contribute to poor directional drilling performance. Several commercial projects are reviewed where technical merit has justified use of Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS), but due to the very soft lithologies, these systems have been unable to deliver the required directional control. In each example, a separate engineered solution is introduced. These include; • An innovative concentric string reamer, featuring a mid-reamer section that enables effective stabilization of the reamer even if the pilot borehole is of poor quality or is over gauge • A soft formation fixed cutter drill bit design with an engineered hydraulic configuration to avoid hole washout and extended circumferential gauge geometry • A near-bit stabilizer incorporating a full ring gauge that delivers 360 degree circumferential coverage, thus providing greater contact with the wellbore and higher potential for deviation • A specific Bi-center design that utilizes a secondary component configuration on the face of the pilot to enable appropriate drilling parameters to be utilized for efficient directional control. The gauge geometry and profile is also tailored to suit soft formation drilling. Global case studies document where these solutions, in combination with both Push and Point RSS, have proven extremely successful. These have provided greater flexibility with regard to tool selection, well planning options, and delivering lower cost per foot in RS projects.

AB  - The African butterfly Bicyclus anynana is an emerging model in evo-devo and eco-evo-devo. Much has been learned about the development, genetics, and evolution of wing eyespot patterns and about how seasonal polyphenism in this species provides an adaptive response to the wet-dry environments it inhabits. Recent work is also examining the role of male secondary sexual traits, the wing scent brushes, and associated sex pheromones in mate choice and sexual selection. However, B. anynana is but one member of a spectacular radiation amounting to some 250 extant species in the subtribe Mycalesina in the Old World tropics. Therefore, it is appropriate timing to consider whether the experimental work on a single species can help in analyzing pattern and process in the spectacular expansion of this whole clade of mycalesine butterflies. The most recent molecular phylogenetics (Kodandaramaiah et al. 2010) underpins the occurrence of several parallel geographical radiations on the African mainland, on Madagascar, and in Asia. Expansions of the mycalesine butterflies into more seasonal environments may have occurred in tandem with those of their larval host plants, the grasses, around 25 million years ago. This article examines how the findings from multidisciplinary work on B. anynana could be the basis for a comparative approach to unravel the processes of adaptation and speciation that have yielded patterns of occupancy of trait space in the mycalesines. The parallel nature of radiations in at leastthree geographical regions provides exceptional power for such an analysis. I argue that research on B. anynana has provided an invaluable backbone for such an endeavor by revealing candidate suites of traits involved in adaptation to new ecological opportunities and in the evolution of reproductive isolation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - The degeneracy among the disc, bulge and halo contributions to galaxy rotation curves prevents an understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter in disc galaxies. In an attempt to break this degeneracy, we present an analysis of the strong gravitational lens SDSSJ2141-0001, discovered as part of the Sloan Lens ACS survey. The lens galaxy is a high-inclination, disc-dominated system. We present new Hubble Space Telescope multicolour imaging, gas and stellar kinematics data derived from long-slit spectroscopy and K-band laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, both from the Keck telescopes. We model the galaxy as a sum of concentric axisymmetric bulge, disc and halo components and infer the contribution of each component, using information from gravitational lensing and gas kinematics. This analysis yields a best-fitting total (disc plus bulge) stellar mass of log10(M*/M⊙) = 10.99+0.11- 0.25. The photometric data combined with stellar population synthesis models yield log10(M*/M⊙) = 10.97 ± 0.07 and 11.21 ± 0.07 for the Chabrier and Salpeter initial mass functions (IMFs), respectively. Assuming no cold gas, a Salpeter IMF is marginally disfavoured, with a Bayes factor of 2.7. Accounting for the expected gas fraction of ≃ 20 per cent reduces the lensing plus kinematics stellar mass by 0.10 ± 0.05dex, resulting in a Bayes factor of 11.9 in favour of a Chabrier IMF. The dark matter halo is roughly spherical, with minor to major axis ratio q3, h= 0.91+0.15- 0.13. The dark matter halo has a maximum circular velocity of Vmax= 276+17- 18kms-1, and a central density parameter of log10ΔV/2= 5.9+0.9- 0.5. This is higher than predicted for uncontracted dark matter haloes in Λ cold dark matter cosmologies, log10ΔV/2= 5.2, suggesting that either the halo has contracted in response to galaxy formation, or that the halo has a higher than average concentration. Larger samples of spiral galaxy strong gravitational lenses are needed in order to distinguish between these two possibilities. At 2.2 disc scalelengths the dark matter fraction is fDM= 0.55+0.20- 0.15, suggesting that SDSSJ2141-0001 is submaximal. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent of all skin cancers in the white population. Dermoscopy is a method that improves diagnosis in pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions, allowing early diagnosis, especially of incipient lesions. The classical dermoscopy algorithm for the diagnosis of BCC includes lack of pigment network and the presence of at least one of the following criteria: ulceration, maple-leaf like structure, blue-gray globules, blue-ovoid nests, arborizing vessels and spoke-wheel structures. The non-classical dermoscopic features of BCC include some criteria more frequently seen in superficial BCC such as pink-white areas, concentric structures, multiple erosions, multiple in-focus blue-gray dots and fine vessels. Recently, the dermoscopy of Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus has also been described with the presence of fine arborizing vessels, white streaks and gray-brown structureless areas. Some dermoscopic structures also present in BCC are just visible with polarized dermoscopy such as white shiny streaks or Chrysalides and Rosetas. Improved knowledge of all these criteria may avoid some diagnostic pitfalls and improve the early recognition of BCCs.

AB  - Predation experiments have shown that the large eyespots (concentric rings of contrasting colors) found on the wings of several lepidopteran species intimidate passerine predators. According to the eye mimicry hypotheses, the intimidation is caused by predators associating the eyespots with the presence (of the eyes) of their own enemy. The conspicuousness hypothesis suggests, instead, that it is simply the conspicuousness of eyespot patterns that is intimidating, possibly due to a sensory bias. We studied how the number of eyespots, 2 or 4, influences intimidation. We predicted that if eye mimicry is important, the maximum response would be reached with a pair of eyespots. On the other hand, if conspicuousness is important, then more than 2 eyespots should result in an even stronger response. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, has 4 large eyespots on its wings. We presented naïve insectivorous birds (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca) 2 different prey items made from wings of dead peacock butterflies and a mealworm between the wings. One group of birds received prey that had no or only 2 eyespots visible and the other group received prey that had no or all 4 eyespots visible. Eyespots clearly increased hesitation before attacks. Because the birds were naïve, this difference in response to the eyespots was innate. Importantly, there was no difference in attack latency between 2 and 4 eyespots. We conclude that it is unlikely that conspicuousness as such has selected for eyespots in the peacock butterfly. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an eccentric hamstring specific training programme on the percentage of bilateral muscle strength imbalance and maximal vertical jump height. Twenty-four, injury free female rugby union players took part in this study. Participants were split into two groups; intervention group (Nordic Hamstring (NH) (n=13) and control group (n=11)). Both groups completed normal training; the NH group completed a concurrent NH programme for 10 weeks. Pre and post-training concentric/ concentric isokinetic testing of peak torque was performed for hamstrings of both legs at 60°/s. Vertical jump height was also assessed. In the NH group, there was a significant decrease in mean percentage bilateral hamstring strength imbalance (pre=10.39 ± 3.53, post=4.63 ± 2.81, p < 0.05). There was also a significant increase in vertical jump height for the NH group (pre=31.22 ± 4.8 cm, post=35.93 ± 4.5 cm, p < 0.05). The NH programme caused favourable adaptations to bilateral hamstring strength imbalance and dynamic lower body performance. A programme based on NH exercise is potentially an effective preventive and rehabilitation tool for hamstring injury. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Argopecten irradians concentricus has been cultivated along the southern coast of China for about 16 generations since its first introduction in 1991. To determine the effects of self-fertilization on the production traits of this isolated bay scallop population, 12 self-fertilized families and a mass-spawned group were produced and studied. The hatching success and survival at larvae, juvenile, and adult stages of the offspring of the mass-mated group were all significantly greater than that of 10 of the 12 self-fertilized families examined, and not significantly different from that of other 2 self-fertilized families. For newly hatched larvae on day 1, no significant difference in size was found among the self-fertilized families and the mass-spawned group. The shell length of the mass-mated group on days 9, 30, 75 and 230, and the live weight on days 75 and 230 were always significantly larger than that of 9 of the 12 self-fertilized families, and not significantly different from that of the other 3 self-fertilized families. In addition, a significant difference in survival, shell length, and live weight was seen among the 12 self-fertilized families at all development stages. The current study demonstrated the occurrence of inbreeding depression for production traits in the closed population of A. irradians concentricus and the necessity of avoiding inbreeding when creating a breeding production, although not all families are significantly affected by inbreeding.

AB  - A new decoupling algorithm is proposed to estimate DOA of concentric uniform circular arrays (C-UCA). The new algorithm can calibrates mutual coupling of the inner sub-arrays, compensate for mutual coupling between sub-arrays, and then estimate DOA of signal sources. This algorithm transforms joint problem into cascade problem and gets the parameters by one dimension spectrum peak value searching, which avoids multidimensional nonlinear searching of multi-parameters joint estimation. The simulation and theoretic analysis validate the good performance of the proposed algorithm. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - Attention of this paper is devoted to testing and evaluation of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer specimens with lock-in thermography. Several specimens were prepared by a vacuum infusion technique using a low-viscosity epoxy system; delaminated areas were simulated by the insertion of thin Kapton® diskettes at a given depth through the thickness. Artificial defects had different shapes (circular or elliptical) and dimensions. Inserts were located at different depths and, in some cases, by overlapping more than one Kapton®-shaped layer (i.e. two or more concentric discs, each of different diameter). A preliminary test campaign was performed by differential scanning calorimetry and rheometry to find optimal processing parameters to achieve fully cured state of matrix and to avoid the formation of defects in accordance with aerospace standards for composites manufacturing. Specimens were non-destructively inspected with optical lock-in thermography; results were presented in terms of phase images. All inserts were discovered and also well outlined under difficult conditions such as in the case of thin overlapped foils.

AB  - Many species of lepidoptera bear conspicuous circular patterns on their wings, known as eyespots, that are hypothesised to protect their bearers against predatory birds. In this study, we focus on a small but ubiquitous feature occurring naturally in lepidopteran eyespots, namely the so-called 'sparkle'. The 'pupil' in an eyespot is often highlighted by a 'sparkle', which is hypothesised to mimic a natural corneal total light reflection evident as a highlight, twinkle, or sparkle in the vertebrate eye. In a study exploring the presence of such sparkles, we found that 53% of lepidopteran eyespots exceeding 1mm in diameter have a central, pinpoint-like 'sparkle', 12% have a marginal, crescent-shaped 'sparkle', 13% have a semi-circular 'sparkle', and 22% have an intermediate semi-circular to crescent-shaped 'sparkle'. In the lepidopterans' natural resting position, the marginal 'sparkles' are positioned in the upper part of the eyespots''pupil' and thus may create the illusion of a spherical eyeball. The 'sparkles' in lepidopteran eyespots do not only appear white to humans, but also reflect ultraviolet light. White and UV-reflecting 'sparkles' also appear 'white' for UV-sensitive viewers such as birds, and thus may effectively mimic the natural highlight in vertebrate eyes as an area of total light reflection. In field experiments using lepidopteran dummies baited with a mealworm, we show that the 'sparkle' is one of several components of eyespots eliciting a deterrent effect and that eyespots with a 'sparkle' in a natural position have a stronger deterrent effect than those with a 'sparkle' in an unnatural position. These findings support the eye mimicry hypothesis that better vertebrate eye mimicry improves the deterrent effect of eyespots. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Within the context of the preparation of a flora for the identification of freshwater dinoflagellates, the identity ofGlenodinium edax and the affinities of a group of phagotrophic species with a conspicuous eyespot not associated withplastids (eyespot type C) currently classified in Katodinium were re-evaluated. The original description and illustrationsof the phagotrophic G. edax suggest affinity with the Pfiesteriaceae. Whereas the tabulation currently associated with G.edax is based on a probable misidentification, the similarity to Tyrannodinium berolinense suggests that the two namescan be regarded as synonyms and T. edax comb. nov. is proposed. As presented in modern floras, Katodinium isartificially defined on the basis of the position of the cingulum at or below the posterior third of the cell, and includeswidely different forms. The presence of an eyespot of type C in the phagotrophic Katodinium vorticella and relatedspecies combines with a general cell morphology reminiscent of Esoptrodinium gemma and the formation of Tovellia-likecysts to mark this group of species as belonging to the Tovelliaceae. The type species of Katodinium, K. nieuportense, ismorphologically quite different from these species and does not display tovelliacean characters. None of the knowngenera of Tovelliaceae matches the characters of K. vorticella and its close relatives. Opisthoaulax gen. nov. is described and new combinations are proposed for K. vorticella and six other species.

AB  - Combining Alternate Path shunt tube technology with concentric sand-face completion systems is improving operational efficiency and economics while bringing new life to old offshore wells in Malaysian waters. Mature offshore Malaysia wells are being worked over as part of a production enhancement program in a depleted, highly unconsolidated, laminated sandstone reservoir. The test well for the project initially came online in 1977, producing from the upper zone. A 1979 attempt to test the lower zone was unsuccessful because of sand accumulation above the plug. Three sand control methods standalone screens, expandable sand screens, and cased-hole gravel packs - were considered for the work over program. The three options were evaluated for ensuring successful prevention of sand and fines migration considering formation particle size distribution, productivity index, and reliability and failure rates of each completion method.

AB  - There are concerns that genetically modified soybean might threaten the genetic diversity of the wild soybean populations that are distributed in East Asia because genetically modified soybean has no crossing barrier with wild soybean. A simple and effective method to prevent hybridization via pollen flow is spatial separation between the two species because their hybridization occurs only when they grow in close proximity. Therefore, the invasiveness of wild soybean needs to be known in order to secure the appropriate distances. As wild soybean seeds are dispersed mechanically by pod dehiscence, an experiment was conducted in which white sheets were placed on the ground, concentric circles were drawn around the parent plants, and the number of dispersed seeds within each 0.5m-wide zone were counted. About 40% of the produced seeds were dispersed and the number of dispersed seeds gradually declined as the distance from the parent plants increased. The model that explained the relationship between the number and distance of the dispersed seeds was produced by using a generalized linear model procedure. More than 95, 99, and 99.9% of the produced seeds stayed within 3.5, 5.0, and 6.5m after natural pod dehiscence. Knowing these values is useful for evaluating the level of invasive risk by mechanical seed dispersal. The goal of the work is to efficiently and deliberately prevent hybridization by isolating genetically modified soybean fields and wild soybean populations by vegetation management, including weeding and setting up specific-width buffer zones. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE. To characterize the effects on refractive error development and eye growth in young chicks of two-zone concentric lens designs, which differentially affect the defocus experiences of central and peripheral retinal regions. METHODS. Monocular defocusing lenses were worn for 5 days from 17 days of age. Four two-zone concentric lens designs (overall optical zone diameter, 10 mm) combining plano with either+5- or+5-D power were used. Lens designs were as follows: (1)+5 D center (-5C), (2)+5 D periphery (-5P), (3) -5 D center (-5C), and (4)+5 D peripheral (-5P), with plano in periphery for all C-designs and in the center for P-designs. Five central zone diameters (CZDs) were tested, ranging from 2.5 to 6.5 mm in 1-mm increments. Plano,+5- and -5-D single-vision (SV) lenses were used as the control. A minimum of six birds were included in each lens group. RESULTS. For the two-zone lenses, the P designs (i.e., peripheral defocus) had greater effects than the C designs (i.e., central defocus) on both on-axis eye growth and refractions. All but the 6.5-mm CZD+5P lens induced larger changes than the+5SV lens. The+5C lenses with CZD less than 5.5 mm had little effect. The two-zone+5-D lenses had less effect than the -5SV lens, and only the 6.5-mm CZD lens of the -5C series had a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS. The results demonstrate that peripheral defocus can influence both peripheral and central refractive development. The inhibitory effect on axial eye growth of the+5P lenses opens the possibility that appropriately designed concentric lenses may control the progression of human myopia. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

AB  - In order to realize the alignment of primary and secondary mirrors in large aperture telescopic system and improve optical imaging quality, a new method for adjusting comparative position and pose between primary and secondary mirrors is introduced named high-precision alignment machining. Other than a traditional method of adjusting washer, the method can eliminate astigmatism aroused from inclination between primary and secondary mirrors, and coma aberration aroused from secondary mirror's eccentricity at the same time. The method reduces the alignment difficulty markedly and avoids systemic instability. In addition, a new method for primary and secondary mirrors test is established by combination of interference auto-collimating tests and cross wire application which replaces optical axis. The alignment and test's result from the Φ520 mm primary and secondary mirrors shows that root-mean-square (RMS) value of wave aberration hardly changes before and after assembling, and is entirely less than 0.03λ (λ=632.8 nm), axial angles swaying in primary and secondary mirrors are 0.72″ and 2″, respectively, the verticalities of two mirrors optical axis and respective frames are less than 0.005 mm, primary and secondary mirrors's concentricity is less than 0.01 mm, and the RMS value of the system is less than 0.7 λ after interation, which achieves design requirements.

AB  - 1. Aposematic coloration in prey promotes its survival by conspicuously advertising unpalatability to predators. Although classical examples of aposematic signals involve constant presentation of a signal at a distance, some animals suddenly display warning colours only when they are attacked. 2. Characteristics of body parts suddenly displayed, such as conspicuous coloration or eyespot pattern, may increase the survival of the prey by startling the predator, and/or by signalling unpalatability to the predators at the moment of attack. 3. The adaptive value of such colour patterns suddenly displayed by unpalatable prey has not been studied. We experimentally blackened the red patch in the conspicuous red-white-black hindwing pattern displayed by an unpalatable insect Lycorma delicatula White (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) in response to predator's attack. 4. There was no evidence that the presence of the red patch increased prey survival over several weeks. We hypothesise that predators generalised from the red-white-black patches on the hindwings of unpalatable L. delicatula to any similar wing display as a signal of unpalatability. Because a higher proportion of males than females stay put at their resting sites, displaying their wings in response to repeated attacks by predators, wing damage was more frequent in males than in females. 5. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test of an adaptive role of aposematic signals presented by unpalatable prey during sudden displays triggered by direct predatory attack. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Documentation of predator attacks in nature is important for understanding how specific antipredator defences have evolved, but previous accounts have been mostly anecdotal. Therefore, we monitored predation on two closely related butterfly species, Aglais urticae and Inachis io, during winter hibernation. Butterflies were placed singly close to the floor on walls in dark, seminatural hibernation sites (e.g. unheated outhouses). We used motion-initiated infrared-sensitive cameras to record predator attacks on the butterflies. The antipredator attributes of the two species have two characteristics: during rest the butterflies reduce predators' attention by mimicking leaves but they can suddenly change their guise by repeatedly flicking their wings. The wing flicking also produces hissing sounds and ultrasonic clicks and, furthermore, I. io, but not A. urticae, have large eyespots on the dorsal wing surface. The two butterfly species suffer from mouse predation during the winter and mice have been suggested as potential targets for the butterflies' sound production. Results showed that (1) mice (Apodemus spp.) were important predators on butterflies, (2) I. io often survived attacks by wing-flicking behaviour, and (3) both species moved to less accessible positions after interactions with mice and other small mammalian predators, but I. io more often so. The successful predator evasion in darkness by I. io suggests a multimodal defence; in addition to the large eyespots, which intimidate birds, we suggest that the hissing and/or click sounds produced during wing flicking may have evolved as defence against rodent attacks. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Structural remodeling is a major feature of heart failure and typically precedes the development of symptomatic disease. Structural remodeling of the heart reflects changes in myocyte morphology. Disproportional myocyte growth is observed in pathologic concentric hypertrophy (myocyte thickening) and in eccentric dilated hypertrophy (myocyte lengthening). Alterations in myocyte shape lead to changes in chamber geometry and wall stress. Human and animal studies indicate that changes in myocyte morphology are reversible. Normalization or reversal of maladaptive cardiomyocyte remodeling should be a therapeutic aim that can prevent deterioration or improve cardiac function in heart failure. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Anti-theft system of monitoring on petroleum pipeline is an important part of safety and protection system on petroleum and chemical engineering industries. In this paper, conventional Anti-theft system of monitoring on petroleum pipeline is simply introduced and its merits and shortcomings are analyzed. Then, a novel Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based anti-theft system of monitoring on petroleum pipeline is proposed, which is designed with the method from bottom to top and according to the special application field of the safety and protection system on petroleum pipeline. The proposed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based anti-theft system of monitoring on petroleum pipeline consists of a subsystem of WSN, a common shared platform for data transfer and service and a subsystem for concentric monitoring and controlling. Accurately prewarning could be realized in the proposed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based anti-theft system of monitoring on petroleum pipeline. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To compare knee extension-flexion isokinetic performance between elite swimmers of simultaneous (SS - butterfly and breaststroke) and alternated swimming (AS - front crawl and backstroke) styles. Method: Nineteen short distance elite swimmers (50 m, 100 m and 200 m events), divided into SS (n=7; 23.3 ± 5.6 years) and AS (n=12; 22.6 ± 1.4 years) were tested for knee extension-flexion isokinetic strength at 60°/s (4 repetitions) and endurance at 300°/s (30 repetitions). Results: There were no significant differences between groups or legs for concentric knee extension and flexion variables. However, the agonist/antagonist (HQ) ratio was lower (p=0.032) in AS than SS group for both legs. Conclusion: These results indicate the need for training programs to improve strength balance between hamstrings and quadriceps muscles in short distance elite swimmers. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

To solve this problem, a set of multifocal images can be used to extend the depth of the field by fusing the best-focused image regions to an overall well-focused composite image. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method that avoids the computational cost problem of previous extended-depth-of-field algorithms. On the basis of the special optical geometry properties of catadioptric systems, the proposed model describes the shapes of the best-focused image regions in multifocal images by a series of neighboring concentric annuluses. Then we propose a method to estimate the model parameters. On the basis of this model, an overall well-focused image is obtained by combining the best-focused regions with a fast and reliable online operation. Experiments on catadioptric images of a variety of different scenes and camera settings verify the validity of the model and the robust performance of the proposed method. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB  - One of the key components in sports injury prevention is the identification of imbalances in leg muscle strength. However, different leg muscle characteristics may occur in large playing area (field) sports and small playing area (court) sports, which should be considered in regular injury prevention assessment. This study examined the isokinetic hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) ratio and bilateral leg strength balance in 40 male college (age: 23.4 ± 2.5 yrs) team sport players (field sport = 23, soccer players; court sport = 17, volleyball and basketball players). Five repetitions of maximal knee concentric flexion and concentric extension were performed on an isokinetic dynamometer at two speeds (slow: 60 °•s-1 and fast: 300°•s-1) with 3 minutes rest between tests. Both legs were measured in counterbalanced order with the dominant leg being determined as the leg used to kick a ball. The highest concentric peak torque values (Nm) of the hamstrings and quadriceps of each leg were analyzed after body mass normalization (Nm•kg-1). Court sport players showed significantly weaker dominant leg hamstrings muscles at both contraction speeds (P < 0.05). The H:Q ratio was significantly larger in field players in their dominant leg at 60°•s-1 (P < 0.001), and their non-dominant leg at 300°•s-1</ sup> (P < 0.001) respectively. Sport-specific leg muscle strength was evident in college players from field and court sports. These results suggest the need for different muscle strength training and rehabilitation protocols for college players according to the musculature requirements in their respective sports. © Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics.

AB  - This paper considers two novel controller synthesis methodologies using a feedforward control structure for performing concentric self-servo track writing in hard disk drives. In the first methodology, it is assumed that a conventional causal track-following controller has been designed and a non-causal feedforward controller, which utilizes the stored error signal from writing the previous track, is designed using standard H∞ control synthesis techniques, in order to prevent the track errors from propagating and to achieve good disturbance attenuation. In the second methodology, both the track-following feedback controller and the feedforward controller are simultaneously designed via a mixed H2/H ∞ control scheme, which involves the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities and achieves good disturbance attenuation while preventing the propagation of track errors from the previous tracks. Simulation results confirm that the two proposed control synthesis methodologies prevent error propagation from the previously written tracks and significantly improve concentric self-servo track writing performance. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Eyespot formation in butterfly wings has been explained by the concentration gradient model. However, this model has recently been questioned, and dynamic interactions between the black-inducing signal and its inhibitory signal have been proposed. Here, the validity of these models was examined using a nymphalid butterfly Junonia almana. Early focal damage to the major eyespots often made them smaller, whereas the late damage made the outer ring larger and the inner ring smaller in a single eyespot. Non-focal damage at the outer ring not only attracted the whole eyespot structure toward the damaged site but also reduced the overall size of the eyespot. Surprisingly, a reduction of the major eyespot was accompanied by an enlargement of the associated miniature eyespots. These results demonstrate limitations of the conventional gradient model and support a dynamic interactive nature of morphogenic signals for colour-pattern determination in butterfly wings.

AB  - Yeast cells normally grow by budding, but under certain specific conditions they are also able to grow in hyperpolarized forms reminiscent of hyphal growth. During vegetative growth, the synthesis of the septum that physically separates yeast cells during cytokinesis depends on the correct assembly of the septin ring. Septins and actin patches are assembled at the neck, forming two concentric rings where the actin patch ring occupies the external-most part. This specific positioning defines a plasma membrane region at the neck from which other lateral membrane compartments are excluded. In this scenario, correct assembly of the chitin ring is dependent on the anchoring of Chs3 to the septin ring through Chs4. The anchoring of Chs3 to septins through Chs4 prevents the arrival of this protein at endocytic sites, thus reducing the endocytosis of Chs3. This allows an equilibrium to be set up between the antero- and retrograde transport of Chs3, facilitating the synthesis of the chitin ring at the neck. In contrast, hyperpolarized growth is characterized by a reduced endocytic turnover of Chs3, which in turn lead to the accumulation of Chs3 at the plasma membrane and a concomitant increase in chitin synthesis. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that wearing a patellofemoral brace during strenuous training resulted in a decreased incidence of anterior knee pain (AKP). However whether this effect is derived from quadriceps enhancement remains unknown. Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Methods: Ninety-eight military recruits, 35 'with-brace' and 63 without, underwent concentric isokinetic tests at 60 and 240°/s of the quadriceps prior to and following a 6-week basic military training (BMT). The randomly selected 35 subjects 'with brace' received a pair of patellofemoral braces (On-Track, DJ Ortho) and were instructed to wear these braces throughout training. Results: Baseline strength characteristics of the quadriceps were not significantly different between the braced and non-braced group (p > 0.05). No significant time-effect was observed in the braced group. There was a significant decrease in quadriceps strength at 60°/s after BMT in the non-braced subjects (p < 0.001) while at this speed these subjects had a significantly (p =0.02) lower strength compared to their non-braced counterparts. Conclusion: Patellofemoral bracing may be effective in preventing a decrease in quadriceps strength after prolonged strenuous training. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although a number of hypotheses about the origin of the Bronze Age plastic art have been formulated, it is a rather difficult task to identify those elements that would enable us to scientifically justify the actual cultural and symbolic implications and dimensions of such artefacts. A particularly interesting category of Bronze Age art is that of the anthropomorphic representations, be them either renderings of the human body as a whole or of its anatomical parts (figurines or artistic appliqués). In the Zuto-Brdo - Gârla Mare area anthropomorphic figurines are a somewhat regular encounter, having been found both in necropolises and settlements. What has particularly drawn my attention is a series of plain clay representations of the human foot (pl. I/1a-d, 2a-c; II/3a-3b; III/5-6) some of them perforated and used as amulets. They sparked my interest due to their undeniable symbolic value as parts of the funerary inventory of cremation tombs identified in the necropolises of: Ostrovul Corbului-Bivolǎrii, Cârna-Ostrovogania and Gârla Mare-La nisipuri. Their presence in the grave pit alongside cremated remains may be an indication of their apotropaic function of protecting the remains of the purified body during the soul's transition to the other world. Some of these pieces were erroneously considered ornithomorphous representations most probably due to their protuberances and decorative motifs (spirals, circles, concentric circles with rays) used to render the eyes of the ornithomorphous figurines or the ankles in human leg representations. Starting from this point I tried to establish a series of stylistic differences between the two types of representations whose importance lies in the high frequency of their occurrence. Ornithomorphous representations were linked to uranian beliefs through the similarities between bird migration, death, sun and nature regeneration. Clay representations of the human foot, on the other hand, could have been held capable to provide protection both in this world and in the one beyond. This is supported by the presence of anthropomorphic representations in the inventory of some of the cremation graves belonging the Zuto-Brdo - Gârla Mare culture, but also by certain elements of the funerary rite such as the custom of placing the cinders in urns or burial pits. The earthly remains would be protected by either ceramic fragments or clay vessels, in the spirit of certain spiritual beliefs. In this way it was ensured that the deceased would resurrect into a new body represented by the vessel. It was the peak moment of the existential cycle began upon the incineration meant to purify the soul, continued with the journey to the other world and the return or resurrection of the deceased.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to study the efficacy of six fungicides comprising contact, systemic and botanical fungicides and three biocontrol agents for the management of bird's eye spot disease in tea plantations. Among 16 treatments, systemic fungicides were found to be superior to biocontrol agents in controlling the disease whereas the maximum green leaf yield was significantly increased in those applied with biocontrol agents. On the whole, Streptomyces sannanensis offered the maximum yield of 3998kgha -1 made tea followed by Trichoderma harzianum (3884kgha -1 made tea). Between the two different carrier materials evaluated for the application of biocontrol agents, vermicompost-based bioformulation showed better efficacy than talc-based formulation. Of the three (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) groups of biocontrol agents, S. sannanensis was better than Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma atroviride belonging to bacterial and fungal antagonists; respectively in terms of disease protection and increasing yield potential. Similarly, the biometric, physiological and biochemical parameters were also increased in plants greatly after imposing various treatments. Plucking surface of the bush, number of plucking points per unit area, internodal length, leaf moisture and dry matter contents were found higher in plots applied with biocontrol agents than those treated with fungicides. Almost all of the tea quality parameters such as total liquor colour, thearubigins, theaflavins, highly polymerized substance and caffeine were significantly improved in biocontrol treated plants. Theaflavin and thearubigin contents were increased in the range of 9.00-9.57% and 1.27-1.54% respectively in vermin based treatment. Similarly the amount of caffeine content (3.66-4.08%) and flavour index (4.18-5.31%) were considerably enhanced. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exploring ‘margins’ in the eighteenth century entails searching the places where the century overflows its bounds, and refuses to be contained or corralled by any monolithic notion. In a book published several decades ago, Georges Benrekassa reopened this question, with a view to re-examining the screen of rationality that veiled the century, a rationality conceived as ‘faith’. For Benrekassa, the margins of the Enlightenment are to be found above all through a process of ideological tunnelling, in order to uncover the spaces eccentric to the age of reason understood as a ‘thought of ordering’ (p. 12). In clarifiying his approach, his effort to avoid the trap of concentricity, he wrote that ‘the question we are faced with is how to break these circles within which the ideology of the Enlightenment contemplates itself’ (p. 13). In effect, Benrekassa's critique belongs to a genealogy that began with the work of Horkheimer and Adorno in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), a critique of Enlightenment reason as a force of domination, and that was continued by Foucault in Discipline and Punish (1977). Foucault lays bare, behind the positivity of the contract and the idealisation of law promoted by the philosophes, a series of disciplinary devices, technologies of coercion. This essay will explore the question of margins in a less ideological fashion by repositioning the literature of the eighteenth century in the context of certain works of history with a sociological dimension. A reversion to concentricity tends to circumscribe the period's major writers, the philosophes. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - In case of a severe accident, a debris bed is formed from a mixture of molten core and the residual water in the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel. The presence of decay heat in a debris bed poses a critical threat to the reactor pressure vessel. To avoid any damage to the reactor pressure vessel, the removal of decay heat from the debris bed is of great importance. In order to investigate experimentally the long-term coolability of debris beds, the non-nuclear test facility "DEBRIS" has been established at IKE. Experimental investigations of coolability limits for such a debris bed, based on two different bed configurations and at various thermo-hydraulic conditions, are carried out at IKE. This paper presents the experimental results for multidimensional cooling effects on boiling and dryout tests with different bed configurations and different system pressures. Two different down comer configurations (cylindrical and perforated cylindrical tubes with inner diameters of 10 mm each) are used to investigate the multidimensional cooling effects. The down comer is concentrically installed inside the debris bed which is contained in a cylindrical crucible with an inner diameter of 125 mm. Different bed configurations, e.g. polydispersed particle bed with spherical particles 2, 3 and 6 mm in diameters and irregular particles of equivalent diameters 2-10 mm, have been used with a bed height of 640 mm. A layer of ceramic balls of diameter 4 mm with 40% porosity is used to make up a water pool at the bottom of the bed. The bottom inflow via the down comer tube as well as the lateral inflow of water through the perforated down comer tube into the bed improves the coolability of the debris bed, and therefore an increase of the dryout heat flux can be observed. Experimental results also show that the system pressure has no significant effect on the characteristics of pressure gradients inside the bed, whereas with increasing system pressure the coolability limits are increased. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns consist of many color-pattern elements such as eyespots. It is believed that eyespot patterns are determined by a concentration gradient of a single morphogen species released by diffusion from the prospective eyespot focus in conjunction with multiple thresholds in signal-receiving cells. As alternatives to this single-morphogen model, more flexible multiple-morphogen model and induction model can be proposed. However, the relevance of these conceptual models to actual eyespots has not been examined systematically. Here, representative eyespots from nymphalid butterflies were analyzed morphologically to determine if they are consistent with these models. Measurement of ring widths of serial eyespots from a single wing surface showed that the proportion of each ring in an eyespot is quite different among homologous rings of serial eyespots of different sizes. In asymmetric eyespots, each ring is distorted to varying degrees. In extreme cases, only a portion of rings is expressed remotely from the focus. Similarly, there are many eyespots where only certain rings are deleted, added, or expanded. In an unusual case, the central area of an eyespot is composed of multiple eyespots but the overall macroscopic eyespot structure is maintained. These results indicate that each eyespot ring has independence and flexibility to a certain degree, which is less consistent with the single-morphogen model. Considering a eyespot which has repeats of a set of rings, damage-induced eyespots in mutants, and a scale-size distribution pattern in an eyespot, the induction model is the least incompatible with the actual eyespot diversity. © 2011 Zoological Society of Japan.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an ongoing research project on the seismic performance of concentrically braced steel frames of the Conventional Construction category designed according to NBCC 2010 and CSA-S16 seismic provisions. The braced frames studied are of the tension-compression X-bracing configuration and special attention is devoted to the response of the connection at the brace intersection point. Numerical simulations were performed to determine the inelastic demand on the braces and brace connections. A test program including four full-scale quasistatic cyclic tests was carried out to verify the findings of the numerical simulations. The results indicate that the behaviour of the bracing members is influenced by the type of mid-connection. In particular, connections with single lap splices at the intersection of the braces may be prone to local instability. In all tests, failure occurred in the connections, indicating that more attention must be paid in design to prevent premature and brittle failure in connections. © ASCE 2012.

AB  - A new method for camera calibration by using concentric circles and wedge grating based on the orthogonal vanishing point calibration is proposed. This method uses the characteristics of the high-precision of the phase extraction to obtain the feature points, thus avoiding the calibration errors caused by the traditional marker extraction errors. The camera should capture the pattern images at least six positions. The wrapped phase of the grating can be gained by four-step phase shifting and the zero phase intersection points coordinate of the wrapped phase are calculated from images. The vanishing points and all the intrinsic parameters of the camera can be calculated. According to the simulation experiment analysis results which include factors influencing the vanishing point calibration accuracy, the concentric circles grating with seven periods and the wedge grating with four periods are designed. In the real measuring experiment, the grating target and gray concentric circles target are used to calibrate the camera respectively. Through comparing the reprojective errors of the two methods, it can be proved that the method proposed improves the calibration accuracy and robustness for the vanishing point calibration algorithm.

AB  - Stiffness control of a continuum robot can prevent excessive contact forces during robot navigation inside delicate, uncertain and confined environments. Furthermore, it enables the selection of tip stiffnesses that match varying task requirements. This paper introduces a computationally-efficient approach to continuum-robot stiffness control that is based on writing the forward kinematic model as the product of two transformations. The first transformation calculates the non-contact kinematics of the robot and can be formulated based on the specific type of continuum robot under consideration. The second transformation calculates the tip deflection due to applied forces and is efficiently computed using the special Cosserat rod model. To implement a desired tip stiffness, the two transformations are used to solve for the actuator positions that deform the manipulator so as to generate the required tip force at the measured tip position. The efficacy of the proposed controller is demonstrated experimentally on a concentric-tube continuum robot. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - Numerous butterflies have circular patterns called eyespots on their wings. Explanations for their functional value have until recently remained hypothetical. However, several studies in the last few years have supported long-standing hypotheses, and the current paper reviews these recent advances. Large and conspicuous eyespots are thought to be effective by being intimidating to predators and thus reducing predation. This hypothesis has received strong support in different studies. It has been shown that eyespots are intimidating because of their conspicuousness, but experimental support for the idea that eyespots are effective by mimicking vertebrate eyes is at the moment lacking. Studies have also tested the deflection hypothesis, where smaller marginal eyespots are thought to deflect attacks away from the body of the prey, increasing chances of survival with a torn wing. Despite previous negative results, recent work has shown that eyespots can indeed deflect attacks toward themselves under specific conditions. Furthermore, data show that dorsal eyespots are used by males and females as signals during courtship. How the diversity in ventral eyespot patterning has evolved remains a mystery. Future directions and further challenges in understanding the adaptive value of eyespots are discussed. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - The aims of this study is to examine whether global dominance depends on the opening size of the stimulus with concentric hierarchical figures and orientation classification task and to determine the role of the salience of global opening and its coincidence with vertical symmetry axis of context. In the first experiment, participants had to indicate the opening direction of stimuli, which were open-left and open-right figures. Three openings were included: 10, 25 and 50% of the total circle perimeter. The results showed a local advantage with stimuli of 10%, absence of global or local advantage with stimuli of 25% and global advantage with stimuli of 50%. In the second experiment, stimuli with an opening of 50% were presented randomly in several positions in the visual field in order to avoid the coincidence of global opening with the vertical symmetry axis of context. The results showed an absence of global or local advantage. These findings indicate that global dominance with orientation classification task depends on stimulus characteristics such as opening size, and strategies used in visual recognition. © 2010 Psicothema.

AB  - The Tunk Lake pluton of coastal Maine, USA is a concentrically zoned granitic body that grades from an outer hypersolvus granite into subsolvus rapakivi granite, and then into subsolvus non-rapakivi granite, with gradational contacts between these zones. The pluton is partially surrounded by a zone of basaltic and gabbroic enclaves, interpreted as quenched magmatic droplets and mushes, respectively, as well as gabbroic xenoliths, all hosted by high-silica granite. The granite is zoned in terms of mineral assemblage, mineral composition, zircon crystallization temperature, and major and trace element concentration, from the present-day rim (interpreted as being closer to the base of the chamber) to the core (interpreted as being closer to the upper portions of the chamber). The ferromagnesian mineral assemblage systematically changes from augite and hornblende with augite cores in the outermost hypersolvus granite to hornblende, to hornblende and biotite, and finally, to biotite only in the subsolvus granite core of the pluton. Sparse fine-grained basaltic enclaves that are most common in the outermost zone of the pluton suggest that basaltic magma was present in the lower portions of the magma chamber at the same time that the upper portions of the magma chamber were occupied by a granitic crystal mush. However, the slight variations in initial Nd isotopic ratio in granites from different zones of the pluton suggest that contamination of the granitic melt by basaltic melt played little role in generating the compositional gradation of the pluton. The zone of basaltic and gabbroic chilled magmatic enclaves, and gabbroic xenoliths, hosted by high-silica granite, that partially surround the pluton is interpreted as mafic layers at the base of the pluton that were disrupted by invading late-stage high-silica magma. These mafic layers are likely to have consisted of basaltic lava layers and basalt that chilled against granitic magma to produce coarse-grained gabbroic mush. Basaltic and gabbroic magmatic enclaves and gabbroic xenoliths are hornblende-bearing, suggesting that their parent melts were relatively hydrous. The water-rich nature of the underplating mafic magmas may have prevented extensive invasion of the granitic magma by these magmas, owing to the much greater viscosity of the granitic magma than the mafic magmas in the temperature range over which magma interaction could have occurred. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The current large-eddy simulation (LES) research makes use of the contravariant components as the dependent variables on a staggered grid system for the discretisation of the governing equations in curvilinear coordinates. This technology provides a possibility to investigate efficiently turbulent flows in complex geometries. To test and validate the recently developed in-house LES code, LESSGA (Large-Eddy Simulation on a Staggered Grid Arrangement), numerical simulations were performed for turbulent flows in a concentric annular pipe and transitional flows past an airfoil. In this article, the computed results of flows in a concentric annular pipe with a radius ratio of a = Rinner/Router = 0.5 at Rēτ = 100 - 200 and flows past an SD7003 airfoil at Rec = 60,000 and angle of attack α = 4° are compared with available experimental and DNS data. Technical difficulties experienced are also discussed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is described as the sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms caused by myofascial trigger points (TrPs). Knowing the potential causes of TrPs is important to prevent their development and recurrence, but also to inactivate and eliminate existing TrPs. There is general agreement that muscle overuse or direct trauma to the muscle can lead to the development of TrPs. Muscle overload is hypothesized to be the result of sustained or repetitive low-level muscle contractions, eccentric muscle contractions, and maximal or submaximal concentric muscle contractions. TrPs may develop during occupational, recreational, or sports activities when muscle use exceeds muscle capacity and normal recovery is disturbed. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - In almost all seismic design codes the 'Response Modification Factors' (RMFs) are used to take into account the inelastic behavior of the building structures. However, suggested RMF by codes is a single value for each type of structure, which means that for case of CBFs, as an example, it is independent of the bracing pattern, namely the number of braced bays, their relative locations, or their distribution in the building's plan or elevation. This means that the code considers the ultimate load bearing capacity, or more specifically speaking, the seismic performance of a CBF, independent of its bracing pattern. However, several studies have shown that this is not true. This paper tries to show the dependency of the seismic performance of CBFs to the bracing pattern by using the fragility concepts. For this purpose some sets of steel buildings with 4- by 6-bay plans having 3, 5, and 7 stories have been considered, with various bracing patterns, including bracing in adjacent bays and bracing in non-adjacent bays. Then, the fragility curves have been developed for these buildings by performing a series of Nonlinear Time History Analyses (NLTHA). The buildings have been assumed to be regular in both plan and elevation to avoid the torsion effects. In NLTHA several recorded accelerograms, with various Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values and also different frequency contents, have been used for each building to create a relatively large statistical data for developing the fragility curves with high reliability. Based on the numerical results it can be concluded that for moderate to high PGA values (between 0.3g and 0.6g) the effect of bracing pattern in remarkable, so that the fragility values for the case of bracing in adjacent bays is 10% to 50% lower than those related to the pattern in which the bracing elements are location in non-adjacent bays.

AB  - Eyespots (patterns of roughly concentric rings) are often thought to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have lent support for the intimidation hypothesis by demonstrating a deterring effect of eyespots, but so far there is little evidence for the deflective effect (direction of attacks toward less vital body parts). We studied predators' responses towards large and small eyespots and towards prey with no, one, or a pair of eyespots and if this response is influenced by whether or not prey blend into background. In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators. In experiment 1, we found evidence for the deflective effect of small but not large eyespots, independent of whether the prey was presented on a concealing or exposing background. In experiment 2, we found that predators avoided the prey with a pair of small eyespots more than the prey without eyespots, but interestingly, we only found this deterring effect on the concealing background. There was no difference in attacks between the prey with one large and two small or one large and no eyespots. We conclude that deflective function may select for eyespots, and background may influence the deterring function of eyespots. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Snow moulds are fungi and fungal-like microbes that occur frequently as pathogens of moss and vascular plant species in the Arctic and Antarctic, chiefly in maritime areas with permanent snow cover for several months of each year. Here, we review the environments inhabited by polar snow moulds, their distribution and the macroscopic features of infections, such as the sclerotia that form on the leaves of higher plants, or the more frequently encountered concentric rings found in moss stands. The microscopic features of infections are described, as are the taxa of snow moulds found in polar habitats, such as the ascomycetes Thyronectria antarctica var. hyperantarctica and Sclerotinia borealis, the basidiomycete Typhula ishikariensis and the oomycete Pythium. Recent research, also reviewed here, indicates that a heterothallic species of Pythium apparently has a bipolar distribution. The adaptations of snow moulds to polar environments, such as their growth at low temperatures, are covered, as are avenues for future research on these microbes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB  - Introduction and objective: Studies that relate parameters of muscular performance in different sports, and especially in soccer, have been frequently reported in the literature. However, the methodological variations among studies, the type of dynamometer used in each search and placement of each subject during the evaluations results in the divergence of the data collected. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a data collection to provide figures on the muscular profile and establish normative parameters for the professional soccer players' muscular performance, supporting scientific research and future studies. Methods: The sample consisted of 39 athletes from a professional soccer club in Porto Alegre. In order to evaluate muscular performance, an isokinetic dynamometer was used and the tests consisted of maximal concentric contractions, being knee flexors and extensors muscles tested at 60°/s and 240°/s velocities. Analysis of means by t test (independent samples) was used to investigate significant differences between legs considering the parameters evaluated in this study. For all statistical procedures the confidence interval was 95% (p <0.05). Results: The results of this study characterized the muscular profile of professional soccer players on the capacity of torque, work and maximum power, normalized by body weight. Moreover, significant differences were observed between legs considering some of the study's variables. Conclusion: The normative data set can be used as reference values for prevention, training and rehabilitation of athletes, and serve as reference for future studies with the aim to relate parameters of muscular performance and incidence of injuries in soccer.

AB  - One of the challenges in the production of electricity is the cooling water management because the calcium content in circulating cooling water continues to increase with time as pure water evaporates. Thus, the excessive mineral contents in water circulation systems could cause severe fouling in heat transfer equipment. To avoid the catastrophic failure in condensers, the cooling water is discharged after 3 cycles at a rate of 10 million gallons a day in a 1,000-MW thermoelectric power plant. The present study investigated the effect of pulsed spark discharges on the mitigation of mineral fouling in a concentric counterflow heat exchanger. Artificial hard water with calcium carbonate hardness ranging from 250 to 500 ppm was used with velocity varying over a range of 0.1 - 0.5 m/s and zero blowdown. Fouling resistances decreased by 50-88% for the plasma treated cases compared with the values for no-treatment cases. SEM photographs showed particle with larger sizes for the plasma treated cases comparing to smaller but more organized particles for the no-treatment cases. The different structures of particles were associated with pulsed spark discharge assisted precipitation of calcium carbonate in oversaturated hard water. X-ray diffraction data showed calcite crystal structures for all cases. © 2010 by ASME.

AB  - Considering the practical geometry of rotational tool and the relation between the material properties and temperature, the effect of shoulder geometry on material plastic flow behavior in friction stir welding is simulated by the ANSYS FLUENT software. In the simulation, the plane shoulder, the inner-concave-flute shoulder and the concentric-circles-flute shoulder are studied. The results show that the change of shoulder geometry nearly has no effect on the trend of material flow. For the material flow velocity, the value of the concentric-circles-flute shoulder is the biggest, while that of the plane shoulder is the smallest. For avoiding root defect, the rotational tool with concentric-circles-flute shoulder is better than that with inner-concave-flute shoulder, which is verified by experiment.

AB  - The presence of shrub vegetation is very significant in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the difficulty involved in shrub management and the lack of information about behavior of this vegetation means that these areas are often left out of spatial planning projects. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) has been used successfully in forestry to estimate dendrometric and dasometric variables that allow to characterize forest structure. In contrast, little research has focused on shrub vegetation. The objective of this study was to estimate dry biomass of shrub vegetation in 83 stands of radius 0.5m using variables derived from LiDAR data. Dominant species was Quercus coccifera, one of the most characteristic species of the Mediterranean forests. Density of LiDAR data in the analyzed stands varied from 2 points/m 2 to 16 points/m 2, being the average 8 points/m 2 and the standard deviation 4.5 points/m 2. Under these conditions, predictions of biomass were performed calculating the mean height, the maximum height and the percentile values 80th, 90th, and 95th derived from LiDAR in concentric areas whose radius varied from 0.50m to 3.5m from the center of the stand. The maximum R 2 and the minimum RMSE for dry biomass estimations were obtained when the percentile 95th of LiDAR data was calculated in an area of radius 1.5m, being 0.48 and 1.45kg, respectively. For this radius, it was found that for the stands (n=39) where the DTM is calculated with high accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.20m) and with a high density of LiDAR data (more than 8 points/m 2) the R 2 value was 0.73. These results show the possibility of estimating shrub biomass in small areas when the density of LiDAR data is high and errors associated to the DTM are low. These results would allow us to improve the knowledge about shrub behavior avoiding the cost of field measurements and clear cutting actions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To increase wetland acreage and biodiversity, state agencies constructed more than 220 depressional wetlands throughout Delaware. We investigated effects of landscape composition within 1,000 m and 5,000 m of 20 Kent County, Delaware constructed wetlands on their avian, macroinvertebrate, and vegetative communities. Using digital orthophotography and geographic information system (GIS), we quantified agriculture, early successional, forest, development, freshwater wetlands, roads, and streams within concentric buffers. We also calculated distance to nearest forest, wetland, and paved road edge from the wetland's center. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the biotic communities and regressed richness and diversity values against landscape variables. Proximity of nearest forest edge was the most important variable in explaining avian and vegetative richness and diversity. We detected negative relationships with distance to nearest forest and bird richness, bird diversity, total plant richness, facultative wetland plant cover, and native, exotic, and obligate wetland plant richness and cover. Furthermore, bird richness and diversity increased with forest area within 1,000 m and bird diversity increased with forest area within 5,000 m. To optimize biodiversity, managers should consider proximity to forest for wetlands constructed in agricultural landscapes. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - In this paper, thermomechanical coupling analysis of two concentric cylinders with initial gap is investigated by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method. The thermomechanical coupling analysis is divided into a thermal subproblem and a mechanical subproblem in the sequencial coupling algorithm. The Picard iteration procedure with a relaxation technique is also employed to accelerate the rate of convergence of the iterative procedure and avoid numerical instability. Due to the existence of the thermal contact resistance (TCR) between these two cylinders, some interesting thermomechanical coupling phenomena appeared. It is found that a proper initial gap may greatly reduce the maximum equivalent stress in structures. Moreover, the DG finite element method not only can be used to simulate the thermomechanical coupling problems effectively, but also can find out this proper initial gap, which is valuable in engineering design and structural safety assessment.

AB  - Considering the practical geometry of rotational tool and the relation between the material parameters and temperature, the finite volume model of friction stir welding is established on basis of the ANSYS FLUENT software. The effect of shoulder geometry and pin geometry on material plastic flow behavior is studied. The results of numerical simulation show that the flow velocity of material decreases with the increase of the distance away from the weldment surface or the rotational axis of pin. The flow velocity of material inside weldment is increased by decreasing the cone angle of pine or decreasing the width of screw groove. When the rotational tool with the left screw pin rotates clockwise, the flow direction of material near pin is downward while the flow direction near the thermal-mechanical affected zone is upward, which is opposite to that of the right screw pin. From the view of improvement of material flow, the concentric-circles-flute shoulder is better than the inner-concave-flute shoulder or the plane shoulder. Therefore, choosing the reasonable shoulder geometry and the reasonable pin geometry can be good for improving the material flow during the friction stir welding process and avoiding the root defects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Desiccating sunflower (. Helianthus annuus L.) to hasten harvest has become common practice in the northern U.S. and can aid in reducing yield loss associated with severe weather, plant degradation, and bird predation. Current recommendations are to apply desiccants to sunflower at 35% or less seed moisture corresponding to physiological maturity (PM). However, evidence suggests PM may occur at higher seed moisture. Therefore, a 2-yr field study was conducted at Prosper, ND, and Morris, MN, with the objective being to model the dynamic relationship of seed dry matter accumulation to moisture content in sunflower seed of two high-oleic oilseed hybrids and one confectionary hybrid to estimate seed moisture content at PM. Between stages R6 and R9 (PM), seed samples were collected from capitulum at 4-7. d intervals. Seeds were separated from the inner, middle, and outer concentric thirds of the capitulum for analysis. Average moisture content across middle and outer seed at PM for both oilseed hybrids was about 40% regardless of environment, but it was 50% for the confectionary hybrid. Inner seed lagged behind middle and outer zones in reaching PM, but only comprises about 11% of total seed on capitulum. Approximately 600-666. °C. d were required for seed to progress from R6 to PM for the oil hybrids and 486-612. °C. d for the confectionary hybrid. For both types of hybrids, PM occurred about 3. d later in middle seed as compared to outer seed. Indeed, our results indicate modern sunflower hybrids can be desiccated at higher seed moisture than currently recommended without sacrificing yield loss due to not reaching PM. © 2012 .

AB  - Conventional special concentrically braced frames (SCBF) have been widely used due to their efficiency in resisting lateral forces. Under severe lateral loading, braces will buckle, laterally and locally, leading to a deterioration of the strength and stiffness of the SCBF and under repeated excursions of cyclic inelastic deformation to fracture of braces. On the other hand, buckling restrained braced frames (BRBF) provide more stable hysteretic behavior. The collapse resistance of SCBF and BRBF systems is examined. A series of 2, 3, 6, 12 and 16 story tall, double story X braced frame archetypes designed using the provisions of ASCE-7/05 for seismic design category D min and D max are analyzed using the ATC-63 methodology. The paper examines modeling of steel braced frames, including brace buckling and rupture due to low cycle fatigue, as well as the application of the ATC 63 methodology. Results of representative static pushover and dynamic analyses are presented. For the assumptions in the ATC 63 methodology and the current ability to model braced frame behavior, it was found that, except for lowrise SCBF structures, a high confidence of achieving the collapse prevention limit state was provided. Reasons for the behavior predicted are presented, along with recommendations for improved design and evaluation methods.

AB  - The capillary instability of two annular layers confined between two concentric cylinders is considered under conditions of Stokes flow. The inner cylinder, the outer cylinder or both cylinders may be absent, yielding an interior or exterior annular layer or a thread suspended in an infinite medium. The interface exhibits constant surface tension and develops viscous interfacial tensions due to the interfacial flow driven by the instability. A linear stability analysis for axisymmetric perturbations is carried out confirming the stabilizing effect of the surface viscosity over a broad range of conditions. In the case of a thread suspended in vacuum, the surface viscosity is not able to emulate an external medium viscosity. Numerical solutions of a simplified system of evolution equations for long waves using a particle method suggest that surface viscosity prevents thread break-up after a finite evolution time. © 2010 The Author.

AB  - Introduction: The use of dual mobility cups is an effective method to prevent dislocations. However, the specific design of these implants can raise the suspicion of increased wear and subsequent periprosthetic osteolysis. Hypothesis: Using radiostereometric analysis (RSA), migration of the femoral head inside the cup of a dual mobility implant can be defined to apprehend polyethylene wear rate. Study objectives: The study aimed to establish the precision of RSA measurement of femoral head migration in the cup of a dual mobility implant, and its intra- and interobserver variability. Material and methods: A total hip prosthesis phantom was implanted and placed under weight loading conditions in a simulator. Model-based RSA measurement of implant penetration involved specially machined polyethylene liners with increasing concentric wear (no wear, then 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. mm). Three examiners, blinded to the level of wear, analyzed (10 times) the radiostereometric films of the four liners. There was one experienced, one trained, and one inexperienced examiner. Statistical analysis measured the accuracy, precision, and intra- and interobserver variability by calculating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), Intra Class correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. Results: Our protocol, that used a simple geometric model rather than the manufacturer's CAD files, showed precision of 0.072. mm and accuracy of 0.034. mm, comparable with machining tolerances with low variability. Correlation between wear measurement and true value was excellent with a CCC of 0.9772. Intraobserver reproducibility was very good with an ICC of 0.9856, 0.9883 and 0.9842, respectively for examiners 1, 2 and 3. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent with a CCC of 0.9818 between examiners 2 and 1, and 0.9713 between examiners 3 and 1. Discussion: Quantification of wear is indispensable for the surveillance of dual mobility implants. This in vitro study validates our measurement method. Our results, and comparison with other studies using different measurement technologies (RSA, standard radiographs, Martell method) make model-based RSA the reference method for measuring the wear of total hip prostheses in vivo.

AB  - The effects of landscape attributes on Lepidoptera communities were studied in an agricultural area in Calabria (S-Italy). The association between a set of community descriptors and landscape metrics was determined using a multi-scale approach. Lepi- doptera were sampled using yellow sticky traps in 10 olive groves. The landscape in 5 concentric areas, with radii from 250 to 1250 m, around each sampling site was analyzed. The composition and configuration of the landscape were calculated both at the landscape and class level based on the main classes of land use. The following life-history traits of Lepidoptera were considered: (i) dispersal ability of adults, (ii) habitat preferences and (iii) diet breadth of larvae. An index of community vulnerability was calculated by combining life-history traits and species diversity. There were no significant correlations between any of the landscape metrics and species richness or between species richness and abundance of natural or semi-natural habitats. However, life-history traits were significantly correlated with some landscape metrics, depending on the spatial scale. Most notably, landscape diversity is positively correlated with community vulnerability. The presence of sensitive species in olive orchards, but not species richness per se, is associated with the presence of natural and semi-natural habitats in the surrounding agricultural landscape. In conclusion, responses of communities to landscape changes are more likely to be revealed by an analysis of ecological traits, than species richness. In particular, the vulnerability index, used in this joint analysis of the main ecological traits, seems to be an effective descriptor of the relationships between communities and landscape.

AB  - Ideas and observations stemming from bicultural experience and the larger issues of identity, immigration, and globalization are central to Anya Belkina's work. She fuses art with inquiry in the areas of biology, physics, and computer science. MOSTON, a 12-foot-tall suspended inflat-able sculpture, embodies an internal conception of home and the cyberfusion of two geographically distant locales: Moscow and Boston. Its surface design of printed artwork and documentary footage projection explores visual and historical commonalities of the two cities, commonalities that are more easily researched, documented, and shared in the era of instant global networking. While MOSTON's three-dimensional form references ethnically specific artifacts, the visual appeal and conceptual ingenuity of matryoshkas reach audiences beyond Russia and the Russian diaspora. A universally understood symbol of sequential creation, these toys offer a fitting framework for evoking the concentric evolution of Moscow's and Boston's city armatures. The implied nestedness of MOSTON is also congruent with the layered mental construct of "home," especially as perceived by individuals with multicultural backgrounds. Belkina describes the scale of the project as essential, not only because her motherland is the largest country in the world, with an impressive record of pursuing hopeless megalomaniac ventures, but also because "there is no place like home". © 2011 ACM.

AB  - The US Army has planned to roll out the accelerated acquisition of production ground-based sense-and-avoid (GBSAA) systems. The proof-of-concept GBSAA system at EI Mirage uses FAA radars at Brian Ranch and Victorville airports and EI Mirage. These provide surveillance of three concentric cylinders of airspace centered on the airfield, a 20.8-nm-dia. surveillance volume, 13-nm-dia. threat volume and 5-nm operational volume within which the Gray Eagle is allowed to fly as it transitions to and from nearby restricted airspace. The initial phase of GBSAA is called zero conflict airspace and requires the unmanned aircraft to return to a safe state, back on the ground or inside restricted airspace, if the threat volume is breached. GBSAA establishes an administrative procedure to fly unmanned aircraft in controlled airspace and flight tests of the Shadow with DRA's video-based sense-and-avoid technology were also conducted.

AB  - This paper attempts to review the descriptions on the genetic series of neotectonic forms in Eurasia. Morphotectonically, the Eurasian continental block exhibits a radial-concentric pattern consisting of four kinds of tectonic units: platforms, rejuvenated and youthful mobile belts, and the continent-ocean transition zones. Vast areas of young and ancient platforms, such as Siberia, have experienced slow-rate Late-Cenozoic uplift and little interior deformation. The youthful orogenic belts are clustered into the giant Alpine-Himalayan megabelt. The rejuvenated mountain belts are characterized by a variety of structural-morphological types of orogens, such as domelike uplifts, block uplifts and intermountain basins. The continent-ocean transition zones in Eastern Asia, including marginal rifts and extensional basins, are resulted from interaction between the continental block and Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea since the Late Cenozoic. One of the conspicuous features of Eurasia is that most areas lie in the largest geoid depression of the Earth, and the NS trending Uralian-Oman lineament expresses a break on the geoid slope, implying a relationship to deep structure, including density inhomogeneities, downward to the core-mantle interface. Besides, the Eurasian continent fully demonstrates morphotectonic and recent geodynamic features of the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth, just in contrast to that of the Southern Hemisphere. It is best to view the surface morphotectonics and deep structure of the Earth as a geodynamic ensemble which has spawned the large-scale geomorphic features on the surface. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The life cycle of Australapatemon magnacetabulum Dubois, 1988 was resolved experimentally. Planorbid snails Biomphalaria tenagophila (d'Orbigny, 1835) collected in a small pond at the confluence of the San Lorenzo and Arias Rivers, near Salta City, Province of Salta, Argentina, were found to be shedding furcocercous cercariae possessing 4 pairs of penetration glands, 1 pair of unpigmented eyespots, 6 pairs of flame cells in the body, and 1 pair in the tail stem. Metacercariae were found encysted in naturally, and experimentally, exposed leeches Helobdella adiastola Ringuelet, 1972, Helobdella triserialis (Blanchard, 1849), Haementeria eichhorniae Ringuelet 1978, and Haementeria sp., and within their sporocysts in naturally infected planorbid intermediate hosts. Sexually mature adults were recovered from domestic chicks and a duck 828 days postexposure by metacercariae from leeches. The identification of the species was based upon the characteristic large ventral sucker and a genital cone, crossed by a hermaphroditic duct with internal folds, occupying approximately a 1/4 to 1/5 of the hindbody. © 2012 American Society of Parasitologists.

AB  - To better understand the developmental mechanisms of color pattern variation in butterfly wings, it is important to construct an accurate representation of pattern elements, known as the "nymphalid groundplan". However, some aspects of the current groundplan remain elusive. Here, I examined wing-wide elemental patterns of various nymphalid butterflies and confirmed that wing-wide color patterns are composed of the border, central, and basal symmetry systems. The central and basal symmetry systems can express circular patterns resembling eyespots, indicating that these systems have developmental mechanisms similar to those of the border symmetry system. The wing root band commonly occurs as a distinct symmetry system independent from the basal symmetry system. In addition, the marginal and submarginal bands are likely generated as a single system, referred to as the "marginal band system". Background spaces between two symmetry systems are sometimes light in coloration and can produce white bands, contributing significantly to color pattern diversity. When an element is enlarged with a pale central area, a visually similar (yet developmentally distinct) white band is produced. Based on the symmetric relationships of elements, I propose that both the central and border symmetry systems are comprised of "core elements" (the discal spot and the border ocelli, respectively) and a pair of "paracore elements" (the distal and proximal bands and the parafocal elements, respectively). Both core and paracore elements can be doubled, or outlined. Developmentally, this system configuration is consistent with the induction model, but not with the concentration gradient model for positional information. © 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.

AB  - Morphological and behavioural traits can serve as anti-predator defence either by reducing detection or recognition risks, or by thwarting initiated attacks. The latter defence is secondary and often involves a 'startle display' comprising a sudden release of signals targeting more than one sensory modality. A suggested candidate for employing a multimodal defence is the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, which, by wing-flicking suddenly, produces sonic and ultrasonic sounds and displays four large eyespots when attacked. The eyespots make small birds retreat, but whether the sounds produced thwart predator attacks is largely unknown. Peacocks hibernate as adults in dark wintering sites and employ their secondary defence upon encounter with small rodent predators during this period. In this study, we staged predator-prey encounters in complete darkness in the laboratory between wild mice, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus, and peacocks which had their sound production intact or disabled. Results show that mice were more likely to flee from sound-producing butterflies than from butterflies which had their sound production disabled. Our study presents experimental evidence that the peacock butterfly truly employs a multimodal defence with different traits targeting different predator groups; the eyespots target birds and the sound production targets small rodent predators. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: To explain eyespot colour-pattern determination in butterfly wings, the induction model has been discussed based on colour-pattern analyses of various butterfly eyespots. However, a detailed structural analysis of eyespots that can serve as a foundation for future studies is still lacking. In this study, fundamental structural rules related to butterfly eyespots are proposed, and the induction model is elaborated in terms of the possible dynamics of morphogenic signals involved in the development of eyespots and parafocal elements (PFEs) based on colour-pattern analysis of the nymphalid butterfly Junonia almana.Results: In a well-developed eyespot, the inner black core ring is much wider than the outer black ring; this is termed the inside-wide rule. It appears that signals are wider near the focus of the eyespot and become narrower as they expand. Although fundamental signal dynamics are likely to be based on a reaction-diffusion mechanism, they were described well mathematically as a type of simple uniformly decelerated motion in which signals associated with the outer and inner black rings of eyespots and PFEs are released at different time points, durations, intervals, and initial velocities into a two-dimensional field of fundamentally uniform or graded resistance; this produces eyespots and PFEs that are diverse in size and structure. The inside-wide rule, eyespot distortion, structural differences between small and large eyespots, and structural changes in eyespots and PFEs in response to physiological treatments were explained well using mathematical simulations. Natural colour patterns and previous experimental findings that are not easily explained by the conventional gradient model were also explained reasonably well by the formal mathematical simulations performed in this study.Conclusions: In a mode free from speculative molecular interactions, the present study clarifies fundamental structural rules related to butterfly eyespots, delineates a theoretical basis for the induction model, and proposes a mathematically simple mode of long-range signalling that may reflect developmental mechanisms associated with butterfly eyespots. © 2012 Otaki; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The paper deals with comparative analyses of the seismic response of conventionally and innovatively protected steel buildings. A probabilistic characterization in terms of fragility curves of the relevant EDPs to be used within a general probabilistic assessment of the performances of framed steel structures having different earthquake-resistant systems is presented. Both conventional, moment resisting frames and concentrically braced frames, and innovative, base-isolated frames and dissipating braced frames, schemes are considered. The fragility curves represent a step of the knowledge data-base required for carrying out a full probabilistic methodology leading to an effective comparison of the performances of conventional and innovative protection systems accounting for the total costs of all the consequences to the expected seismic attacks. The direct examination of the fragility curves allows to make a rapid assessment of the performance of the different protection systems. © Civil-Comp Press, 2011.

AB  - An epidemiological investigation was undertaken of 41 bovine brucellosis outbreaks that occurred within a 10-month period, in a region where eradication measures appeared to be succeeding. The primary outbreak comprised three herds with significant within-herd spread and a high probability of multiple abortions. Direct contact between cattle at pasture was the most likely means of between-herd transmission for most (71%) outbreaks, with an attack rate of 28.1% in herds immediately neighbouring the primary outbreak herds and 11.3% in the next concentric ring of farms. Resolution of the incident was attributed to a rapid response by the veterinary authorities, detailed epidemiological investigations, repeated, prolonged testing of contact herds and employment of parallel testing. © 2010.

AB  - Aim. Soccer players possess various degrees of functional footedness. Their lower limbs are subjected to consistent asymmetrical workloads and neuromuscular adaptations, and as a result develop asymmetrical patterns of musculoskeletal function. This study focused on the myodynamic profile of the knee and ankle joint in professional soccer players. Special emphasis was put on the multivariate quantification of three types of asymmetry: directional (left vs. right), fluctuating (dominant vs. non dominant) and absolute (left vs. right). Methods. One-hundred professional soccer players (mean age 23.4 years, weight 73.3, height 177.6) were tested isokinetically for concentric and eccentric isokinetic muscle strength (1) of the knee flexors and extensors, and (2) of the ankle dorsal and plantar flexors. Knee flexion-extension was tested at 60°, 180° and 300°/s for the concentric mode of contraction and at 60° and 180°/s for the eccentric. The ankle joint was tested only at 60°/s for both the concentric and eccentric action. Results. MANOVA showed significances for all three types of strength asymmetry (joint and action combined): directional (Wilks' Λ=0.66, F=2.957, P=0.001), fluctuating (Wilks' Λ=0.61, F=2.957, P-0.007), and absolute asymmetry (Wilks' Λ=0.47, F=116.26, P=0.000). Several significant asymmetries were also revealed at the univariate level of analysis (P<0.05). Conclusion. It seems that the lower limbs of professional soccer players are characterized by significant compound muscle strength asymmetries. These findings substantiate the idea of asymmetry in the myodynamic adaptations that take place at the knee and ankle joint of soccer players during the game. Individual modification of the training load, targeting in strength asymmetry correction, should be taken into consideration for injury prevention.

AB  - The speed kidney is composed of a main speed hump and a complementary speed hump disposed on the same cross-section. If passenger car drivers adopt a straight path, they would ride the speed kidney with one or two wheels over the main speed hump, the same as a usual speed cushion or speed table. Consequently, drivers could modify their path, adapting it to the curvature of the main speed hump to avoid both vertical discomfort and mechanical damage. The optimal path of a passenger car would be curved, as a chicane or slight zigzag. The modified line could be composed of a single curve or three circular curves, as a reverse curve. In any case, the central curve and the speed kidney are concentric, with the radius depending on the speed kidney radius. On-street parking must be prohibited on both sides of the speed kidney to allow drivers to safely perform a curved path.

AB  - In this paper three numerical models, eccentric extrusion method to prepare bending tube, concentric partial material extrusion method to prepare bending tube, differential velocity extrusion method to prepare bending tube, are built and simulated. Furthermore analyses distribution of material flow velocity filed, load prediction, distribution of simulated tube wall thickness and so on. Though analysis and verification, we can draw the conclusion that three kinds of process methods are feasible, and avoid the quality defect caused by the traditional manufacturing method such as non-uniform wall thickness and wrinkling. They will have practice directive significance for improving bending tube. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

AB  - Hamstring muscle strains are one of the most frequent injuries in sports and will result in missed game time by athletes. A sudden and forceful eccentric muscle contraction during the later swing phase of sprinting may directly induce hamstring injury, so does a fast change between eccentric and concentric actions in the foot contact phase. Based on the biomechanical analysis of the hamstring muscle activities during sprinting and the studies focused on hamstring strength training, the purpose of this study is to design a strength training machine specific for hamstring. The activity of hamstring muscles during training simulated the key phase of sprinting in terms of contraction modes and loads. The design principle and usage of the machine, as well as the points for attention, are illustrated in this paper. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90. h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Background: balance control is a major problem for older individuals with poor vision. There are limitations, however, for visually impaired elderly persons wishing to participate in exercise programmes. The benefits of Tai Chi for balance control, muscle strength and preventing falls have been demonstrated with sighted elderly subjects. This study was designed to extend those findings to elderly persons with visual impairment.Objective: to investigate the effects of Tai Chi on the balance control of elderly persons with visual impairment.Design: randomised clinical trial.Setting: residential care homes.Subjects: forty visually impaired persons aged 70 or over.Methods: the participants were randomly divided into Tai Chi and control groups and assessed pre- and post-intervention using three tests: (i) passive knee joint repositioning to test knee proprioception; (ii) concentric isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors and (iii) a sensory organisation test to quantify an individual's ability to maintain balance in a variety of complex sensory conditions.Results: after intervention, the Tai Chi participants showed significant improvements in knee proprioception and in their visual and vestibular ratios compared with the control group.Conclusion: practicing Tai Chi can improve the balance control of visually impaired elderly persons. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Groin injuries cause major problems in sports and particularly in football. Exercise is effective in treating adductor-related groin pain, but no trials have been published regarding the specific prevention of groin pain or prevention specifically targeting overuse injuries in sport using exercise programs. We performed a cluster-randomized trial including 55 football clubs representing 1211 players. The clubs were randomized to an exercise program aimed at preventing groin injuries (n=27) or to a control group training as usual (n=28). The intervention program consisted of six exercises including strengthening (concentric and eccentric), coordination, and core stability exercises for the muscles related to the pelvis. Physiotherapists assigned to each club registered all groin injuries. Twenty-two clubs in each group completed the study, represented by 977 players. There was no significant effect of the intervention (HR=0.69, 95% CI 0.40-1.19). The risk of a groin injury was reduced by 31%, but this reduction was not significant. A univariate analysis showed that having had a previous groin injury almost doubles the risk of developing a new groin injury and playing at a higher level almost triples the risk of developing a groin injury. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Measurement of neurotransmitters in the spinal dorsal horn in conscious animals remains a technical challenge. Here we applied concentric microdialysis to measure formalin-induced glutamate (Glu) release in the ipsilateral dorsal horn in conscious, freely-moving rats. Hind paw formalin injection induced flinching nociceptive behaviors accompanied by increased Glu in the dorsal horn (maximum = 294%). Both flinching and Glu increase were prevented by morphine (3 mg/kg, s.c.). Accordingly, concentric microdialysis is a sensitive technique for studying neurochemical modulation induced by pain and analgesics in the spinal dorsal horn of awake rats. Measurement of Glu provides information on modulation of excitatory signals. © 2012 The Japanese Pharmacological Society.

AB  - Surveys and excavations in 1980-1 confirmed Peak Camp as a Neolithic enclosure on a flat promontory of the Cotswold escarpment overlooking the Severn Valley just 1 km south of Crickley Hill. Although heavily eroded by quarrying the site can be reconstructed as having two concentric arcs of boundary earthworks forming an oval plan which was probably open to the north where a steep natural slope defined the edge of the site. A section through the outer boundary showed four main phases of ditch construction, at least one causewayed. An extensive series of radiocarbon dates shows construction began in the late 37th century cal BC and probably continued through successive remodellings into the 33rd century cal BC or beyond. An internal ditch or elongated pit situated in the area between the inner and outer boundary earthworks had a similar history. Where sampled, the ditch and internal feature were rich in material culture, including a substantial assemblage of plain bowl pottery; flint implements and working waste; animal remains dominated by cattle but including also the remains of a cat; human foot bones; slight traces of cereal production; a fragment of a Group VI axe; part of a sandstone disc; and a highly unusual shale arc pendant of continental type. It is suggested that the ditch fills represent selectively redeposited midden material from within the site that started to accumulate in the late 5th or early 4th millennium cal BC. The construction and use of Peak Camp is contemporary with activity on Crickley Hill, and the two sites probably formed components of a single complex. Its use was also contemporary with the deposition of burials at local long barrows in the Cotswold-Severn tradition which are linked by common ceramic traditions and the selective deposition of human body parts.

AB  - Caterpillar defenses have been researched extensively, and, although most studies focus on visually communicated signals, little is known about the role that sounds play in defense. We report on whistling, a novel form of sound production for caterpillars and rare for insects in general. The North American walnut sphinx (Amorpha juglandis) produces whistle 'trains' ranging from 44 to 2060.ms in duration and comprising one to eight whistles. Sounds were categorized into three types: broadband, pure whistles and multi-harmonic plus broadband, with mean dominant frequencies at 15.kHz, 9.kHz and 22.kHz, respectively. The mechanism of sound production was determined by selectively obstructing abdominal spiracles, monitoring air flow at different spiracles using a laser vibrometer and recording body movements associated with sound production using high-speed video. Contractions of the anterior body segments always accompanied sound production, forcing air through a pair of enlarged spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. We tested the hypothesis that sounds function in defense using simulated attacks with blunt forceps and natural attacks with an avian predator - the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia). In simulated attacks, 94% of caterpillars responded with whistle trains that were frequently accompanied by directed thrashing but no obvious chemical defense. In predator trials, all birds readily attacked the caterpillar, eliciting whistle trains each time. Birds responded to whistling by hesitating, jumping back or diving away from the sound source. We conclude that caterpillar whistles are defensive and propose that they function specifically as acoustic 'eye spots' to startle predators. © 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - The presence of subtle cues of being watched has been reported to make people behave altruistically, even when they are anonymous. Individual selection theory predicts that generosity in the presence of eyes is based on the providers' expectation of a future reward. On the other hand, as we are living in quite a large society in which altruistic punishment is effective, the eyes could elicit fear of punishment. However, no previous study has investigated whether people are concerned with their reputation when subtle social cues are present. We conducted the dictator game in the presence of, or without, a painting of stylized eyes. The participants were then asked to complete a post-experimental questionnaire designed to investigate what they were thinking when they decided the amount of money to offer the recipient and how they perceived the experimental situation. Participants in the eye condition allocated more money to the recipient than did those in the control condition. This effect was not mediated by fear of punishment but by the expectation of a reward. Moreover, the results suggested that the participants expected their actions would enhance their reputation in the eyes of a third party. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The mass transfer between immiscible two liquid phases can be greatly accelerated by bubbling gas through a reactor (Bird R. B., Stewart W. E. and Lightfoot E. N., Transport Phenomena, 2nd edition (John Wiley and Sons) 2002). Therefore, the physical phenomenon occurring during the passage of a rising bubble through an immiscible two-liquid interface is of particular interest. The passage of the bubble through the oil (upper phase)/water (lower phase) interface starts with an upward lifting of the interface, and the bubble attracts a column of the water phase upwards keeping a film of the water phase around itself. In the present study, a particular remark is given to the influence of different interface tensions retracting the water film, after the water film ruptured, which lays on the interface between air and silicone oil. Unlike the previous studies on the rupture of a single liquid film in a gas which is pulled due to the identical surface tension, this system can form concentric ripples on the outer interface of the water film (oil/water interface) around the bubble due to the weak interface tension. Then, numerous micro water droplets break out from the fully grown ripples. © Europhysics Letters Association 2010.

AB  - The processes governing the evolution of sexual dimorphism provided a foundation for sexual selection theory. Two alternative processes, originally proposed by Darwin and Wallace, differ primarily in the timing of events creating the dimorphism. In the process advocated by Darwin, a novel ornament arises in a single sex, with no temporal separation in the origin and sex-limitation of the novel trait. By contrast, Wallace proposed a process where novel ornaments appear simultaneously in both sexes, but are then converted into sex-limited expression by natural selection acting against showy coloration in one sex. Here, we investigate these alternative modes of sexual dimorphism evolution in a phylogenetic framework and demonstrate that both processes contribute to dimorphic wing patterns in the butterfly genera Bicyclus and Junonia. In some lineages, eyespots and bands arise in a single sex, whereas in other lineages they appear in both sexes but are then lost in one of the sexes. In addition, lineages displaying sexual dimorphism were more likely to become sexually monomorphic than they were to remain dimorphic. This derived monomorphism was either owing to a loss of the ornament ('drab monomorphism') or owing to a gain of the same ornament by the opposite sex ('mutual ornamentation'). Our results demonstrate the necessity of a plurality in theories explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism within and across taxa. The origins and evolutionary fate of sexual dimorphism are probably influenced by underlying genetic architecture responsible for sex-limited expression and the degree of intralocus sexual conflict. Future comparative and developmental work on sexual dimorphism within and among taxa will provide a better understanding of the biases and constraints governing the evolution of animal sexual dimorphism. © 2011 The Royal Society.

AB  - As a bare cay forms and increases in size, its vegetation goes through a predictable progression of successional stages: bare cay ! pioneer vegetation ! pioneer vegetation plus encirclement by shrubs ! herb meadow ! savannah (parkland) ! forest. Plants of the earliest stages tend to be sea-dispersed whereas later the vegetation consists mostly of bird-dispersed species. The vegetation becomes progressively organized into concentric zones with earlier successional stages located peripherally and later ones successively toward the center. This sequence can be altered, or reversed, by various destructive forces, including trampling by seabirds, uprooting of vegetation by sea turtles, drought, erosion of beaches, washover during storms, and human activities. © 2011, Springer Netherlands.

AB  - Enclosures around single-settlement sites are the products of the countryside rangeland contract system in China, and their recent establishment allows for the investigation of grazing gradients and corresponding rangeland degradation from single focal points. In the present study, which was conducted in an enclosure around a single settlement site in a semi-arid Leymus chinensis-dominated steppe area within the Xilingol Steppe, we analyzed vegetation changes at five distances (concentric half-circles at 250-m intervals that radiated out from the settlement). Our results show a clear trend in small-scale vegetation changes. Based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), the five stages of vegetative degradation from the least to the most degraded were identified in the following order: L. chinensis, L. chinensis + S. grandis, L. chinensis + C. squarrosa (A. cristatum), P. acaulis +A. frigida and A. frigida. Based on indicator species and their above-ground biomass changes, the decreasing rates of the total above-ground biomass in the five stages were 51.5, 50.9, 41.6, 30.2 and 35.9%, respectively, in comparison to the baseline biomasses of selected non-degraded communities. These data indicate that the degradation gradient attenuated from medium to slight as the distance from the settlement in the enclosure increased. This research provides deeper insight into grazing and degradation patterns and processes in enclosures around single settlement sites and reveals that herder-related participatory recovery measures need to be implemented by local rangeland management departments to prevent further land deterioration or an acceleration of currently observed degradation patterns.

AB  - This paper presents a new type of composites structural insulated panels (CSIPs) for structural wall applications. The proposed composite panel is made of low-cost thermoplastic orthotropic glass/poly-propylene (glass-PP) laminate as a facesheet and expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) as a core with very high facesheet/core moduli ratio. The proposed CSIP walls are intended to overcome problems of traditional Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) such as termite attack, mold buildups and poor penetration resistance against wind borne debris. This paper investigates the behavior of CSIPs under concentric and eccentric loading. CSIPs specimens failed by global buckling mode in which no debonding was observed. The eccentric specimens failed at load 35% lower than that of the concentric ones. Global buckling formulas for concentric and eccentric loading were presented and validated using the experimental results and were in a good agreement. An equivalent stiffness formula was also developed for sandwich wall under in-plane loading considering the shear deformations effect of the core. Design study for CSIP walls is also presented to help in designing this new type of composite panels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of fenoterol in the treatment of preterm labor is associated with the risk of many complications in the mother and the fetus. We present a case of a multipara treated with oral fenoterol due to threatening preterm labor 14 weeks. At 35 weeks of gestation the fetus was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe impairment of the right ventricle. The only factor that might have caused such a state of the fetal circulatory system was fenoterol, used from 21 weeks of gestation. After the withdrawal of the fenoterol the fetal right ventricular function improved gradually. However, fetal cardiac hypertrophy persisted until the birth at 39 weeks of gestation. Concentric hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall and interventricular septum were confirmed in the newborn. © Polskie Towarzystwo Ginekologiczne.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process of jamming of the hollow parts on the shaft and to derive a mathematical model for jamming in an assembly process. Design/methodology/approach - The mathematical model for jamming of parts on the shaft in an assembly process is based on the sizes, geometry, angular declination of part and shaft axes, and the frictional factor. Findings - The equation for angular positional tolerance of coaxial parts and shafts, based on their geometry and sizes and leading to jamming, was derived. Research limitations/implications - A mathematical model of parts jamming on the shaft is developed for assembly mechanisms. This research does not consider flexible deformations of components in assembly mechanisms, which results in the axis concentricity of part and shaft in the assembly process. Practical implications - The results presented in the form of angular positional tolerance for coaxial parts and shafts based on their geometry and sizes make it possible to avoid the jamming of the parts. The results allow for formulating the angular positional tolerance of the assembly mechanisms that clamp the parts. Originality/value - The proposed method for calculating the angular positional tolerance of coaxial parts and shafts for the assembly process should allow for increasing the reliability of the assembly process in the manufacturing industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the peer-to-peer video-on-demand (P2P VoD) streaming applications, providing VCR-like operations is important but much challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P scheme-Fibonacci ring overlay networks with distributed chunk storage, called FiRiNet, to reduce jump latency caused by VCR-like operations and avoid an adverse impact caused by VCR-like operations. In FiRiNet, video data is divided into chunks and stored at peers' local storage in a distributed manner. A peer can achieve fast neighbor discovery to reduce jump latency by maintaining some neighbors in a set of concentric rings with Fibonacci sequence radii. Moreover, FiRiNet constructs the overlay networks and distributes the video data based on the stored chunks, which can make FiRiNet avoid an adverse impact caused by VCR-like operations and make FiRiNet resilient to the peer churn caused by VCR-like operations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that FiRiNet is an efficient and resilient scheme with low control overhead, short jump latency, and high streaming quality. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum possesses one of the largest eyespots among the autotrophic dinoflagellates. Until now they were believed to be negatively phototactic using a non-opsin photopigment. Here we provide evidence that in newly established cultures they are positively phototactic and that the dynamic range of phototaxis is ∼ 2.5 log units. Additionally, we find that the spectral sensitivity of the phototaxis agrees reasonably well with the absorption curve of a theoretical opsin, with a peak sensitivity around 500?nm. The sensitivity in the short wavelength end of the tested spectrum is unexpectedly low, but this is probably due to selective filtering. Interestingly, the phototaxis could be temporarily overruled by tactile stimuli. After physical contact with the light guide, the cells escaped the area, and we suggest that this may serve as predator avoidance. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - A push-pull sampling system interfaced on-line to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for micro-volume real-time monitoring of reaction mixtures. The device consists of concentric tubes wherein sample was continuously withdrawn through the outer tube and reaction quenchant continuously delivered through a recessed inner tube. The device allowed sampling rates of 0.1-6.0 μL/min from a reaction vessel and stopped the reaction by passive mixing with quenchant to preserve the conditions observed in the reaction vessel. A finite element model of the system showed that reaction mixtures could be completely mixed with quenchant within 4.3. s at a flow rate of 1.0 μL/min. The model also showed that an offset distance of 1. mm between the push capillary and sample capillary tips is sufficient to avoid leakage of quenchant/diluent into the bulk sample for push flow rates up to 95% of the pull flow rate. The maximum relative push flow rate was determined to be 90% of the pull flow rate experimentally. Delay between sampling and delivery to the HPLC was from 111 ± 3. s to 317 ± 9. s for pull flow rates from 1.0 to 3.0 μL/min in agreement with expected delays based on tubing volume. Response times were from 27 ± 1. s to 52 ± 6. s over the same flow rate range. The sampler was tested to determine the effects of sample viscosity. The sampler was also used to demonstrate periodic sampling capabilities. As a test of the system, it was used to monitor the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of aspirin for 1.5. h, demonstrating its utility for monitoring an ongoing reaction. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The muscles of the back of the thigh with its particular role in movement of athletes and people in general and, therefore, the position of the musculoskeletal system require specific attention in the athlete's training planned procession. As a group of muscles, which has an impact on two joint systems performs multiple missions, it is susceptible to various injuries. They act on the hip joints and knees, which are very important in basic movements of football players. Stabilizing role during movement requires very good coordination among these muscles with the synchronized activity of other muscles. Concentric and especially eccentric movements are very prominent during the movement of the hamstring muscles. Eccentric movements of the muscles lengthen muscle that is contracted and thus require much greater force activity that contributes to a risk of injury. Football as a complex activity has acyclic interval that requires a high degree of development of physical abilities in the modern sport but nobody paid attention to this muscle group. For this reason and many other factors, muscles of the back of the thigh have been frequently injured. Identifying all factors of risk, and trying to remove them is concern of many sports doctors, which is only possible with care and active participation of athletes themselves. © Faculty of Education.

AB  - Background: Although peak torque has shown acceptable reproducibility, this may not be the case with two other often used parameters: time to peak torque (TPT) and the angle of peak torque (APT). Those two parameters should be used for the characterization of muscular adaptations in athletes. Methods: The isokinetic performance of the knee extensors and flexors in both limbs was measured in 29 male athletes. The experimental protocol consisted of three consecutive identical paradigms separated by 45. min breaks. Each test consisted of four maximal concentric efforts performed at 60 and 180°/s. Reproducibility was quantified by the standard error measurement (SEM), the coefficient of variation (CV) and by means of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) with the calculation of 6 forms of ICCs. Results: Using ICC as the indicator of reproducibility, the correlations for TPT of both limbs showed a range of 0.51-0.65 in extension and 0.50-0.63 in flexion. For APT, the values were 0.46-0.60 and 0.51-0.81, respectively. In addition, the calculated standard error of measurement (SEM) and CV scores confirmed the low level of absolute reproducibility. Conclusions: Due to their low reproducibility, neither TPT nor APT can serve as independent isokinetic parameters of knee flexor and extensor performance. So, given its reproducibility level, TPT and APT should not be used for the characterization of muscular adaptations in athletes. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - A spontaneous mutation, ‘Pseudozorro’, has arisen in 1998 in a captive brood of P. apollo maintained by the authors. It induces (i) the production of additional wing veins, (ii) the distortion and confluence of the black spots of the forewing discal cell and (iii) a reduction of the hindwing eyespots and, more generally, of all red components of the wing pattern. Various crosses demonstrated that ‘Pseudozorro’ is dominant and lethal when homozygote. Its expression is quite variable, probably due to epistatic interactions with other loci. When combined with the recessive mutation ‘wiskotti’, it rather attenuates its manifestations; the two loci are not linked. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the Ancient Greek world, textiles, especially decorative ones, were symbols for different kinds of human connections. The regional variance in customs of using textiles for covering and wrapping the dead, their urns and grave goods, is described in detail for Hallstatt, Frög, Bologna and Verucchio. A pendant from Frög corresponds in large part to pictures on Greek vessels that show textiles being made at a loom. By analogy, specific other pendants from male and female graves can therefore be interpreted as pictures of abstract miniature looms. All these objects can be considered as symbols for weaving (and human connections). Religious signs, such as concentric rings or birds, are usually marked on them. Moreover, some ornamented metal belts may have their origin in textile belts. Iron Age belts with pendants thus stand in a Europe-wide and age-old religious tradition. © 2011 Walter de Gruyter.

AB  - Knowledge of lower-extremity strength can be used in injury prevention, conditioning and rehabilitation of volleyball players. The goals were: (1) to describe the bilateral concentric and eccentric quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H) muscle function in volleyball players, (2) to evaluate the differences in Q and H strength, strength ratios and bilateral strength asymmetry among age groups, playing positions and playing levels, (3) to compare bilateral strength asymmetry in Q and H muscles in two different contraction modes. Ninety five professional male volleyball players were tested on an isokinetic machine at 60°/s to assess concentric and eccentric Q and H strength. We also calculated strength ratios and bilateral strength asymmetries. MANOVAs indicated significant main effect of playing level on relative PT (p =0.001) and strength ratios (p < 0.05). International-level players had significantly (p < 0.05) higher H strength and dynamic control ratio (DCR) of the right leg compared to the 1st and/or 2nd national division players. There were no signs of bilateral strength asymmetry regardless of muscle group tested and contraction mode. Our results suggest that right H strength and DCR could be important for successful volleyball performance. Descriptive data about Q and H muscle function can be used as guidelines for coaches and therapists during training and rehabilitation of male volleyball players. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - The use of elastic resistance or 'bands' are utilised in strength training to promote motor learning and improve power. The use of elastic resistance in combination with barbell weight influences force profiles and lifting speeds to enhance the rate of force development. Bands alter the kinetic profile of an exercise by applying greater degrees of force later into the movement, avoiding the deceleration phase at the end of the concentric motion. The force of the bands may also enhance the eccentric training stimulus. Greater force is required to decelerate the load at the end of the eccentric phase of the lift due to the speed effect the bands provide. These factors result in improved strength and functional performance. Pilot testing on the influence of bands on motor learning and corresponding strength was conducted in our gymnasium. The aim of the study was to establish a relationship between the development of motor patterns and transfer of learning to a performance based outcome. The hypothesis of the study was that the use of bands with weight training would develop motor learning patterns at an increased rate than the control group. The results demonstrated that the case group (n=2) had a 14% increase in their maximal squatting strength after only 4 weeks of training using the band resistance, while the control group (n=2) had a 3% increase in maximal strength with convention barbell training after the same amount of time. The aim of this chapter is to present the pilot testing results and methodology, review evidence from the scientific literature on the use of elastic resistance for strength training, and provide practical information on how bands can be used to enhance strength training. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This paper introduces a concentric underreamer incorporating a drop ball mechanism that allows the tool to be unlocked and relocked multiple times without tripping from the well. The rapid implementation strategy and field trials will be presented. Along with a general description of the new technology, new underreaming applications, significant gains in efficiency and increases in cost savings will be discussed. Concentric underreaming tools have been rapidly developed along with the industry-wide acceptance of closed loop rotary steerable systems. Enormous gains in reliability and performance have been made, allowing consistent shoe-to-shoe drilling and underreaming while executing complex trajectories. Well configurations that were actively avoided several years ago, like drilling long sections of salt, are now commonly drilled with rotary steerable tools and concentric underreamers. Most concentric underreamers in use today can be configured to reliably remain locked in the undergauge position until underreaming is required. Some tools can also be relocked after underreaming is completed. Once these tools are relocked they cannot be unlocked again while still in the hole. This is certainly beneficial for circulating at high flow rates, but locking a tool after underreaming has been completed does not allow a tight spot to be re-reamed during the trip out of the hole. Additionally, having a single unlock/lock cycle does not offer the opportunity to underream selected intervals in a hole section and drill with only the bit in others. To enable the well planner to achieve selective underreaming and to retain the ability to lock the tool at the end of the run, a multi-cycle locking/unlocking mechanism was required. There was also an operational need for rapid introduction into the industry with central focus on leveraging existing technology to minimize risk. Rather than starting with a clean sheet of paper and designing an entirely new tool, a field proven, hydraulically actuated, concentric underreamer was adapted to provide for full selectiveness. By adapting an established, field proven tool, the primary challenges involved the cycling mechanism itself. This allowed for more rapid introduction to the industry as the risk to the operator was significantly reduced when compared to running a completely new tool. The operating characteristics of the underreamer were already well understood and the emphasis was placed on the cycling system. The result was a fully selectable, concentric underreamer that offered the flexibility to underream selectively, lock the tool at the end of the run, and finally cycle the tool if necessary during the trip out of the hole.

AB  - Plasma-sprayed Al2O3 interlayer was prefabricated between the bondcoat and topcoat in thermal barrier coatings. It can prevent oxygen penetration through the interconnected porosity in the topcoat, so that the thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth and the failure can be suppressed. But, prefabricated Al2O3 interlayer will result in interfacial stress redistributing. The paper, basing on three-dimensional shape of thermal barrier coatings, using elastic sphere model, considering topcoat, interlayer, TGO and bondcoat, have developed a four-concentric-sphere model of three-dimensional, and produced the relevant analytical model. Furthermore, to verify the results by FEM. In this paper, the analysis of anti-oxidation layer for the concave and convex asperity, indicate that the method can simulate the effect of interlayer on the interfacial microstructure's stress distributing of thermal barrier coatings. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - Enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs) migrate along the intestine to form a highly organized network of ganglia that comprises the enteric nervous system (ENS). The signals driving the migration and patterning of these cells are largely unknown. Examining the spatiotemporal development of the intestinal neurovasculature in avian embryos, we find endothelial cells (ECs) present in the gut prior to the arrival of migrating ENCCs. These ECs are patterned in concentric rings that are predictive of the positioning of later arriving crest-derived cells, leading us to hypothesize that blood vessels may serve as a substrate to guide ENCC migration. Immunohistochemistry at multiple stages during ENS development reveals that ENCCs are positioned adjacent to vessels as they colonize the gut. A similar close anatomic relationship between vessels and enteric neurons was observed in zebrafish larvae. When EC development is inhibited in cultured avian intestine, ENCC migration is arrested and distal aganglionosis results, suggesting that ENCCs require the presence of vessels to colonize the gut. Neural tube and avian midgut were explanted onto a variety of substrates, including components of the extracellular matrix and various cell types, such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. We find that crest-derived cells from both the neural tube and the midgut migrate avidly onto cultured endothelial cells. This EC-induced migration is inhibited by the presence of CSAT antibody, which blocks binding to β1 integrins expressed on the surface of crest-derived cells. These results demonstrate that ECs provide a substrate for the migration of ENCCs via an interaction between β1 integrins on the ENCC surface and extracellular matrix proteins expressed by the intestinal vasculature. These interactions may play an important role in guiding migration and patterning in the developing ENS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are composed of anatomically identifiable pattern elements, whose positional relations are idealized in the "nymphalid groundplan". But the status of the parafocal element and submarginal band (which are collectively called "the peripheral elements" for convenience) in this groundplan has been ambiguous. Herein, I descriptively analyze homologous color-patterns of the parafocal elements in the representative nymphalid butterflies. Cases are presented where the distal and proximal peripheral elements are symmetric on the eyespot focal axis, they are continuous around eyespots, and a given parafocal element shows a concentric pattern. Multi-compartmental comparison of the consecutive parafocal elements on a given wing surface indicates that the relative locations of the parafocal elements can correlate with the eyespot size and that a peripheral part of an eyespot can be "disconnected" from its focal part. These cases suggest the fundamental difficulty in unequivocally distinguishing the parafocal element from the eyespot at least in some nymphalid species. Taken together, it appears that the parafocal element is developmentally regulated by the organizing activity of the prospective eyespot focus, and thus they are to be considered as a part of the border symmetry system. However, the parafocal element also seems to be organized by its own focus that acts as the secondary organizing center at least in some species. These conclusions based on the natural color-patterns are in good agreement with those based on the physiologically-induced color-pattern changes. © 2009 The Entomological Society of Japan.

AB  - Measurements and predictions are made of a short-cowl coflowing jet with a bypass ratio of 8:1. The Reynolds number is 300,000, and the inlet Mach numbers are representative of aeroengine conditions. The low Reynolds number of the measurements makes the case well suited to the assessment of large-eddy-simulation-related strategies. The nozzle concentricity is carefully controlled to deal with the emerging metastability issues of jets with coflow. Measurements of mean quantities and turbulence statistics are made using both laser Doppler anemometry and particle image velocimetry. The simulations are completed on 6× 106, 12× 106, and 50 × 106 cell meshes. To overcome near-wall modeling problems, a hybrid large-eddy-simulation-Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokesrelated method is used. The near-wall Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes layer is helpful in preventing nonphysical separation from the nozzle wall.Copyright © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

AB  - One of the challenges for a modern integrative biology is to more fully understand why assemblages of related species occupy morphospace in the way they do. An integration of analyses of both form and function is required to achieve this goal. The burgeoning understanding of development in emerging model species is providing evolutionary biologists with the potential to explore contributions to the evolution of patterns in morphospace by the processes involved in making variation in forms as well as those resulting from their performance in natural environments. Such an approach is illustrated here by drawing on work on butterfly eyespot patterns and scaling relationships. Relevant studies are being performed in some other groups of animals (see Brakefield 2006), and progress is also being made in plants (see Langlade et al. 2005; Niklas, ch. 3 in this volume). Patterns in morphospace have always fascinated biologists, especially when they are known to reflect adaptive radiation among new ecological niches. In such examples, while there can be no doubt that natural selection plays a major role in shaping the evolution of morphological diversity and disparity, it is by no means clear how much the processes involved in generating variation in the phenotype to be screened by the natural selection also contribute. Thus, the extent to which evolution by natural selection of adaptations to local environments is compromised or biased by the genetical and developmental origins of phenotypic variation remains an open issue. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

AB  - In order to investigate the stability behavior of channels with inclined simple edge stiffeners under axial compression, a total of 504 examples with two external flange dimensions (B=55 mm and B=80 mm), seven stiffener inclined angles (θ equals 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 135° and 150°, respectively), three different thicknesses (t equals 1.0 mm, 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm), six column lengths (L changes from 0.5 m to 3 m with a space of 0.5 m), pin-ended and fixed-ended boundary conditions were selected to be studied by nonlinear finite element analysis under concentric compression loading. The influence of the above parameters on stability behavior of channels with inclined simple edge stiffeners under axial compression was investigated. It is shown that θ has an obvious effect on distortional buckling critical load. For concentrically loaded pin-ended columns, the occurrence of distortional buckling can be avoided effectively if θ is an obtuse angle, and the column strength of channel with 30° slopping edge stiffeners will be the maximum if its failure mode is not controlled by distortional buckling. For concentrically loaded fixed-ended columns, distortional buckling happens easier than pin-ended columns, and most channels with inclined simple edge stiffeners have lower strength than channels with simple edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges under the same condition.

AB  - Drivers realize safety driving by iterating cognition, judgment, and operation sequences appropriately. Probability that the drivers have traffic accidents is increased when required visual information is missed in the phase of visual cognition that brings much important information. In this research, we focus on oversight of pedestrian and other objects while driving as an example of lack of visual information and clarify visual cognitive function relating to the oversight. Thus, we propose dynamic visual field (DVF) as a new measure to evaluate the cognition ability to detect a moving object in peripheral visual field. White solid circles are located concentrically on the black background and a subject gazes the center. One of the circles moves inside slightly and the subject answers the position of the moving circle while she/he notices its movement. First, the DVF is evaluated with a static condition corresponding to stopping driver as a fundamental condition. As a dynamic condition, a visual optical flow task corresponding to moving driver is added. In addition, a mental-arithmetic task is added to the DVF. From the experimental results, we show the validity of the proposed DVF method and some important characteristics of the cognition ability are shown by the method.

AB  - Aim. The lunge movement in fencing generates a different force to the two lower extremities. Knowledge of this difference holds importance for reducing the risk of injury, especially among young fencers. The aim of this study was to measure the forces generated to the lower limbs and to determine whether they differed by gender. Methods. The forces generated by the fencing lunge and the countermovement jump were measured using two force platforms and an accelerometer, supported by dedicated software for data analysis. Results. Statistically significant differences in peak concentric force and the ground reaction force emerged between the male and female fencers (P <0.05). Comparison of the values recorded for the two movements showed that values for the push leg differed on both the lunge (an asymmetrical movement) and the CMJ (a symmetrical movement). Conclusion. Fencing is an asymmetrical sport that produces differences in neuromuscular and functional adaptations in the lower limbs which can influence strength and control demanded by the lunge movement. With muscle conditioning and specific training, this functional asymmetry can be reduced in fencers.

AB  - Various conspicuous signals in nature promote initial and learned avoidance by predators. It is widely thought that such signals are most effective when highly symmetrical in features such as size and shape, supported by recent laboratory experiments with domestic chicks and artificial prey. However, no study has investigated the effect of asymmetry on conspicuous signals in a natural setting, where viewing distances, angles, predator species, and light conditions vary and where predators encounter prey sequentially rather than simultaneously. We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field. Experiment 1 had treatments with symmetrical spots or with spots asymmetrical in area between 5 and 50%. All marked treatments survived better than unmarked controls, but there was no benefit of being symmetrical. Experiment 2 tested the effect of possessing markings asymmetrical for shape or position and any additive effect of these 2 features. Again, symmetry conferred no benefit and targets with markings asymmetrical for position and/or shape survived equally well as those with symmetrical arrangements. These findings indicate that asymmetry in warning signals may not be costly to prey in nature or be of less importance compared with other features of the signal, such as color and overall size. © The Author 2008.

AB  - Animals utilise various strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including camouflage, warning colours and mimicry, and many of these protective signals promote avoidance behaviour in predators. For example, various species possess paired circular 'eyespots', which startle or intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. However, little is known of how the efficacy of such signals relates to the context in which they are found, and no studies have tested the relative effectiveness of anti-predator signals when on otherwise camouflaged and conspicuous prey. We find that the protective value of conspicuous wing spots, placed on artificial moth-like targets presented to wild birds in the field, is strongly affected by the attributes of the prey 'animal' on which they are found. Wing spots reduced predation when on conspicuous prey but were rendered ineffective when on otherwise camouflaged targets, indeed they increased the risk of predation compared to non-marked camouflaged controls. These results demonstrate how different anti-predator strategies may interact, and that protective signals can switch from being beneficial to costly under different contexts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper, the classification of five types of rubber leaf disease by using the spectrometer and SPSS are presented. There are five of leaf disease that have been used as samples which are Oidium secondary leaf fall, Fusicoccum Leaf Blight, Bird eye's spot and Anthracnose. The reflectance of the infected leaves sample is measured by using MCS600 Carl Zeiss spectrometer. Besides, Aspect Plus, a universal spectroscopy program from Zeiss manages to measure the spectral regions of the leaves sample. Further analysis and justification are completed by using approximate statistical tools from SPSS. The results obtained show that there are strong evidences that these diseases can be discriminated from each other using a spectrometer. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Ectoedemia argyropeza (Zeller, 1839) possesses a compound eye that exhibits features of both apposition and superposition type eyes. Like apposition eyes, the eye of E. argyropeza lacks a clear-zone, which in superposition eyes separates the distal dioptric from the proximal light-perceiving structures. On the other hand, a tracheal layer around the proximal ends of the rhabdom as well as a well-developed corneal nipple array on the corneal surfaces are features that E. argyropeza shares with the larger moths. Unique, and so far only seen to this extreme degree in any insect, is the hourglass-shape of E. argyropeza's rhabdom, in which two almost equally voluminous regions (one distal, one proximal and formed in both cases by seven rhabdomeres) are connected by a narrow waist-like region of the retinula. An eighth retinula cell, not participating in rhabdom formation, is developed as a basal cell, just above the basement membrane. The eye responds with photomechanical changes to dark/light adaptation, but while the proximal rhabdom moiety slightly expands (as expected) in the dark, the distal rhabdom increases its diameter only upon light-adaptation. Owing to the tandem position of the two rhabdom moities, it is in the light-adapted state that the distally-placed rhabdom is favoured, while the proximal rhabdom plays a more important role at low ambient light levels. With screening pigments withdrawn, tracheal tapetum exposed, and distal rhabdom diameters reduced, the proximal and in the dark enlarged rhabdom is then in a position to capture photons that have entered the eye through not only the ommatidial window above, but other facets as well even in the absence of a clear-zone and superposition optics.

AB  - Development and diversification of directional-drilling tools continues, as do the applications in which they operate. As a result, there is continual demand for development and refinement of drill bits and string tools to meet the latest challenges and issues faced. One such challenge is the ability to reliably deliver consistent directional performance in very soft formation applications. Issues such as hole washout, inappropriate drilling parameters, stabilization, and hole quality can all contribute to poor directional-drilling performance. Several commercial projects are reviewed where technical merit has justified use of rotary steerable systems (RSSs), but because of the very soft lithologies, these systems have been unable to deliver the required directional control. In each example, a separate engineered solution is introduced. These include • An innovative concentric string reamer (CSR), featuring a mid reamer section that enables effective stabilization of the reamer even if the pilot borehole is of poor quality or is over gauge. •A soft formation fixed-cutter drill-bit design with an engineered hydraulic configuration to avoid hole washout and extended circumferential gauge geometry. • A near-bit stabilizer incorporating a full ring gauge that delivers 360° circumferential coverage, thus providing greater contact with the wellbore and higher potential for deviation. • A specific bicenter design that uses a secondary component configuration on the face of the pilot to enable appropriate drilling parameters to be used for efficient directional control. The gauge geometry and profile is also tailored to suit soft formation drilling. Global case studies document where these solutions, in combination with both push and point RSSs, have proven extremely successful. These have provided greater flexibility with regard to tool selection, well planning options, and delivering lower cost per foot in rotary-steerable projects.

AB  - Video fingerprints can help us identify a large amount of video on the Internet and enable interesting services to the end user. One of the main challenges for video fingerprints is for them to be robust against intentional/ unintentional geometric modifications on the content such as scaling, aspect ratio conversion, rotation and cropping. In this paper, we review a number of fingerprinting methods proposed in literature that are particularly designed to be robust against such modifications. We also present two approaches that we adopted. One that is based on estimation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) bases from a window of past video frames (Approach 1) and another that is based on extraction of moment invariant features from concentric circular regions and doesn't require any specific transform (Approach 2). While both approaches provide the desired robustness against geometric modifications, Approach 1 is computationally more intensive than Approach 2 as the SVD bases are updated for every input frame at 12fps. It also requires a longer query clip than Approach 2 for reliable identification. We present results comparing the performance of both of these approaches for a 150hr video database. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

AB  - Animals often respond to attacks from predators with behaviors directed at the predator that increase the probability of escape. Some animals also respond to attacks with behaviors that release signals or cues that are detected by conspecifics and enhance escape. Cephalopods, with their complex nervous systems, produce many behaviors, one of which is ejecting ink when attacked by predators. Ink is thought to enhance the ability of the inking cephalopod to escape from the predator, which is a reasonable idea but is lacking experimental support and description of mechanisms. Inking might also serve as an alarm cue, evoking alarm responses in conspecifics. The aim of our study was to determine if ink of the Caribbean reef squid, Sepioteuthis sepioidea, is a conspecific alarm cue. We studied freely behaving animals in the laboratory to determine if they produced alarm or escape behavior in response to ink. We observed that squid responded to conspecific ink introduced into their aquarium with deimatic behaviors containing chromatophore elements ('eye spots', 'all brown', and 'flashing'), cryptic behaviors with chromatophore elements ('clear', 'plaid', 'dark arms'), cryptic behaviors with postural responses ('sargassum', 'bad hair'), and protean behavior ('fin movement', 'inking', 'jetting'). Squid also responded to ink introduced into an adjacent aquarium within view, thus demonstrating that vision can contribute to the alarm response. Melanin-free ink did not evoke a significant alarm response. This is the first experimental demonstration that squid respond to ink of conspecifics as a visual alarm cue. Ink may also provide a chemical alarm cue for S. sepioidea, though further behavioral studies are needed to explore this. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some of the significant ceramic works of Oiva Toikka, the Finnish designer of ceramic products, are presented. He started his career during the Golden Age of Finnish design, navigating the confusions of postmodernism, and won several prizes. He was trained in ceramics at the Institute of Industrial Arts, Helsinki, and also worked in the art department at Arabia. He developed many sculptural ceramics and heavily grogged stoneware with rich textured surfaces for Birger Kaipiainen, a ceramic manufacturing company. He resigned from Arabia in 1959 and joined the Nuutajärvi glass factory, where he worked for rest of his career. Toikka also designed the Dewdrop series, a group o molded bowls and plates with a dense and elegant patterns of concentric circles. He also developed the Lollipop series, a brightly colored-free-standing sculptures.

AB  - In this paper, we propose two video fingerprinting methods that are robust to both geometric and non-geometric modifications on content. Both of the proposed methods are based on computation of moment invariants as features from concentric circular regions. The two methods differ in the way they capture appearance and motion information from video. In one method, we capture motion information by computing a difference image between the current video frame and a temporal average video frame computed from a past window of video frames. This method captures appearance by computing moment invariants from concentric circular regions of a video frame. In the second method, we capture appearance and motion by projecting features onto two sets of basis functions and explicitly capture how the moment invariants change over the regions and over time. We present experimental results on both of these video fingerprinting comparing their performance in terms of robustness against attacks and sensitivity to content. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is one of the most important commercial crops in many countries of the world. It contributes nearly 70% of world sugar and provides the base materials essential for many other industries. Sugarcane crop is attacked by numerous foliar and root pathogens. Some of these diseases cause serious quantitative and qualitative losses which have negative effects on sugarcane production, as well as in the sugar industry. About 56 diseases of sugarcane have been reported so far from different parts of the world. Of these, 40 are caused by fungi, several of which can cause economic losses. The major sugarcane fungal diseases in different tropical and subtropical regions are: smut disease (Ustilago scitaminea); rust disease (Puccinia melanocephela); red rot (Glomerella tucumanensis [Colletotrichum falcatum]); eye spot disease (Bipolaris sacchari), pokkah boeng disease (Fusarium moniliforme); and pineapple disease (Ceratocystis paradoxa). This chapter includes the major fungal diseases of sugarcane and the various control practices used against them. © CAB International 2010.

AB  - Most cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) can produce the neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). Dietary exposure to BMAA has been suggested to be involved in the etiology of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ Parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC). Little is known about BMAA-induced neurotoxicity following neonatal administration. Our previous studies have revealed an uptake of BMAA in the hippocampus and striatum of neonatal mice. Furthermore, rats treated with BMAA during the neonatal period displayed acute but transient motoric disturbances and failed to show habituation at juvenile age suggesting impairments in learning functions. In the present study, the aim was to investigate long-term behavioral effects of BMAA administration in neonatal rats. BMAA was administered on postnatal days 9-10 (200 or 600 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection). Spatial learning and memory was investigated in adulthood using the radial arm maze test. The results revealed impaired learning but not memory in BMAA-treated animals. The observed impairments were not due to alterations in motoric capacity, general activity, or behavioral profiles, as assessed in the multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) and open field tests. An aversive stimulus in the MCSF test revealed impairments in avoidance learning and/ or memory. There was no difference in basal serum corticosterone levels in BMAA-treated animals, indicating that the observed long-term effects were not secondary to an altered basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The present data demonstrated long-term learning impairments following neonatal BMAA administration. Further studies on biochemical effects in various brain regions and subsequent behavioral alterations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of BMAA-induced developmental neurotoxicity. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Samaria field in southern Mexico is one of the oldest light oil producers. Reservoir pressures can be classified as highly depleted in cretaceous, the use of nitrogen injection thru the drill pipe to lighten the mud column is a common practice to reach low equivalent circulating densities and avoid massive loss circulation and related hole cleaning problems. Large amounts of nitrogen injection rates are also a common scenario in this specific field many times reaching the technical limit of a multiphase Managed Pressure Drilling application avoiding the friction dominated side of pressure curves. Natural tendency to achieve more production is to drill horizontal wells as demonstrated by the production results of a number of attempts made in the past. However, the presence of high N2 injection rates thru the drill pipe represents a serious challenge for measuring and logging while drilling pulse type downhole tools frustrating the possibility of achieving a full directional control in the reservoir section. Dowhole temperatures are also higher than conventional drilling because of the presence of high gas vs liquid ratios, reaching very fast the technology limits. This document presents the engineering process, planning and design for the drilling with concentric casing nitrogen injection technique in a horizontal well with directional control in real time, into a low pressure reservoir. The technique allowed building up and correcting the well trajectory successfully reaching the proposed targets. (Horizontal length, Drain Area) The steady stable and transient simulations to validate stabilization are also presented along with the final results in terms of production and skin damage.

AB  - Conventional special concentrically braced frames (SCBF) have been widely used due to their efficiency in resisting lateral forces. Under severe lateral loading, braces will buckle, laterally and locally, leading to a deterioration of the strength and stiffness of the SCBF and under repeated excursions of cyclic inelastic deformation to fracture of braces. On the other hand, buckling restrained braced frames (BRBF) provide more stable hysteretic behavior. The collapse resistance of SCBF and BRBF systems is examined. A series of 2, 3, 6, 12 and 16 story tall, double story X braced frame archetypes designed using the provisions of ASCE-7/05 for seismic design category Dmin and D max are analyzed using the ATC-63 methodology. The paper examines modeling of steel braced frames, including brace buckling and rupture due to low cycle fatigue, as well as the application of the ATC 63 methodology. Results of representative static pushover and dynamic analyses are presented. For the assumptions in the ATC 63 methodology and the current ability to model braced frame behavior, it was found that, except for low-rise SCBF structures, a high confidence of achieving the collapse prevention limit state was provided. Reasons for the behavior predicted are presented, along with recommendations for improved design and evaluation methods. © 2010 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Today, the farming community is very dependent on effective fungicides being available in order to stabilize yields and reduce the losses from the development of disease epidemics in cereals. Common practice in many countries is to spray winter wheat two to three times per season and barley crops one to two times depending on the cultivar and disease severity. Currently, wheat often responds by between 1 to 2 t ha-1 for fungicide control measures and barley by 0.5-1.0 t ha-1 depending on weather and disease pressure. Intensive use of fungicides for control of major diseases in wheat like septoria leaf blotch, (Mycosphaerella graminicola), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and eyespot (Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis) has over the years been found to give rise to development of fungicide resistance in relation to benzimidazols, DMIs and strobilurins. In barley, changes have been seen for powdery mildew, scald (Rhynchosporium secalis) and net blotch (Pyrenophora teres). Today, the main fungicides for disease control in cereals are triazols, strobilurins, morpholines and carboxamides and chlorothalonil. The major changes seen in sensitivity to fungicides make it highly relevant and essential to follow the development of fungicide resistance in order to be able to adjust recommendations and avoid unnecessary use of fungicides which are no longer effective.

AB  - A favorite wing pattern element in butterflies that has been the focus of intense study in evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as in behavioral ecology, is the eyespot. Because the pace of research on these bull's eye patterns is accelerating we sought to develop a tool to automatically detect and measure butterfly eyespot patterns in digital images of the wings. We used a machine learning algorithm with features based on circularity and symmetry to detect eyespots on the images. The algorithm is first trained with examples from a database of images with two different labels (eyespot and non-eyespot), and subsequently is able to provide classification for a new image. After an eyespot is detected the radius measurements of its color rings are performed by a 1D Hough Transform which corresponds to histogramming. We trained software to recognize eyespot patterns of the nymphalid butterfly Bicyclus anynana but eyespots of other butterfly species were also successfully detected by the software. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Many animals are marked with conspicuous circular features often called 'eyespots', which intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. It has long been assumed that eyespots work by mimicking the eyes of larger animals, but recent experiments have indicated that conspicuousness and contrast is important in eyespot function, and not eye mimicry. We undertake two further experiments to distinguish between the conspicuousness and mimicry hypotheses, by using artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field. In experiment 1, we test if eyespot effectiveness depends on the marking shape (bar or circle) and arrangement (eye-like and non- eye-like positions). We find no difference between shapes or arrangement; all spots were equally effective in scaring birds. In experiment 2, we test if the often yellow and black colors of eyespots mimic the eyes of birds of prey. We find no effect of shape, and no advantage to yellow and black spots over non-eye-like but equally conspicuous colors. The consistent finding is that eyespot function lies in being a conspicuous signal to predators, and not necessarily due to eye mimicry. © 2009 Current Zoology.

AB  - Visual patterns in animals may serve different functions, such as attracting mates and deceiving predators. If a signal is used for multiple functions, the opportunity arises for conflict among the different functions, preventing optimization for any one visual signal. Here we investigate the hypothesis that spatial separation of different visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. Using phylogenetic reconstructions of character evolution and comparisons of evolutionary rates, we found dorsal surface characters to evolve at higher rates than ventral characters. Dorsal characters also displayed sex-based differences in evolutionary rates more often than did ventral characters. Thus, dorsal characters corresponded to our predictions of mate signalling while ventral characters appear to play an important role in predator avoidance. Forewing characters also fit a model of mate signalling, and displayed higher rates of evolution than hindwing characters. Our results, as well as the behavioural and developmental data from previous studies of Bicyclus species, support the hypothesis that spatial separation of visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. This study is the first to demonstrate, in a phylogenetic framework, that spatial separation of signals used for mate signalling and those used for predator avoidance is a viable strategy to accommodate multiple signal functions. This signalling strategy has important ramifications on the developmental evolution of wing pattern elements and diversification of butterfly species. © 2009 The Royal Society.

AB  - With the rapid growth of networked data communications in size and complexity, network administrators today are facing more challenges to protect their networked computers and devices from all kinds of attacks. This paper proposes a new concentric-circle visualization method for visualizing multi-dimensional network data. This method can be used to identify the main features of network attacks, such as DDoS attack, by displaying their recognizable visual patterns. To reduce the edge overlaps and crossings, we arrange multiple axes displayed as concentric circles rather than the traditional parallel lines. In our method, we use polycurves to link values (vertexes) rather than polylines used in parallel coordinate approach. Some heuristics are applied in our new method in order to improve the readability of views. We discuss the advantages as well as the limitations of our new method. In comparison with the parallel coordinate visualization, our approach can reduce more than 15% of the edge overlaps and crossings. In the second stage of the method, we have further enhanced the readability of views by increasing the edge crossing angle. Finally, we introduce our prototype system: a visual interactive network scan detection system called CCScanViewer. It is based on our new visualization approach and the experiments have showed that the new approach is effective in detecting attack features from a variety of networking patterns, such as the features of network scans and DDoS attacks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using a convective plume model and a ray trace model, we investigate the effects of winds on concentric rings of gravity waves (GWs) excited from a convective plume on "11 May 2004, near Fort Collins, Colorado. We find that winds can shift the apparent center of the concentric rings at z = 87 km from the plume location. We also find that critical level filtering (for GWs with small phase speeds propagating in the same direction as the wind) and wave reflection (for high-frequency GWs with small horizontal wavelengths propagating in the opposite direction to the wind) prevent many GWs from reaching the OH airglow layer. Additionally, we find that strong winds disrupt the concentric ring patterns, causing distorted "squashed" ring and arc-like patterns instead. Using a zero wind profile and a representative April mean zonal wind profile, we compare, our model results with observations of concentric rings at the Yucca Ridge Field Station (40.7°N, 104.9°W). We find that the model horizontal wavelengths and periods agree reasonably well with the observed data. We also compare the model temperature perturbations with the temperature perturbations calculated from the intensity perturbations. Because the observations show less critical level filtering than from the April wind profile and more critical level filtering than from the zero wind profile, we conclude that the winds on 11 May were likely somewhat smaller than the April zonal wind profile assumed here.

AB  - As companies shift focus towards cutting budgets and finding ways to lower operating costs, their efforts can sometimes have the reverse effect. Understanding coatings and utilizing good block maintenance is very important as it can rdeuce wire breaks, encourage longer wear life for drawing blocks, and reduce production down time. The single most important process in block maintenance is grinding, which is the process that controls concentricity, radius, taper and ultimately finish. The most crucial of all block parameters is taper, which is required to keep each successive wire wrap climbing smoothly, so as to avoid overlapping, and wire shooting up scenarios. The industry standard for taper is the measurement of the angle with a centerline or straight edge, not the included angle. The restore and grind process represents a significant advancement in the cost reduction associated with the repair and coating of wiredrawing blocks.

AB  - Breast cancer is a very common disease and the cause of death of many people. It has been proven that prevention decreases the death rate, but the costs of diagnosis and image processing are very high when applied to all the population with potential risk. This paper studies an existent computer aided diagnosis method using neural network and improves its detection success rate from 60% to 73%. This improvement is achieved due to the use of image and statistical operators over concentric regions around the tumor boundaries. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder causing mucosal inflammation of the colorectum with crypt abnormality on biopsy. It affects the rectum and a variable extent of the colon in continuity. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. It arises from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, but the precise etiology is unknown. The incidence and prevalence in Korea are still low compared with those of Western countries, but have increased in recent years. There are many challenging issues on the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, and sometimes these lead to differences in practice between clinicians. Therefore, IBD Study Group of KASID set out the Korean diagnostic guideline of ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis is based on clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic criteria. The symptoms are dependent upon the extent and severity of disease and most commonly include bloody diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and/or urgency. The systemic symptoms of malaise, tachycardia, fever, or weight loss are features of a severe attack. The laboratory findings may reveal leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein indicating severe disease activity or chronicity. For the elimination of infectious causes, microbial investigation with stool specimens should be performed for common enteric pathogens including assays for Clostridium difficile toxin, and sometimes for amoeba or other parasites. The most typical endoscopic features are continuous, confluent, and concentric colonic involvement proximal to the anal verge. Endoscopic severity may be best well reflected by the presence of mucosal friability, spontaneous bleeding, and deep ulcerations. Typical pathologic findings are composed of widespread crypt architectural distortion (cryptitis, crypt abscess, and crypt atrophy), heavy, diffuse lamina propria cell infiltration, and basal plasmacytosis.

AB  - The function of anti-predator signalling is a complex, and often-overlooked, area of animal communication. The goal of this study was to examine the behavioural function of an antipredator acoustic signal in the ocean. We observed the acoustic and defensive behaviours of California spiny lobsters (Palinuridae: Panulirus interruptus) to a model predator, model conspecific and blank pole, both in the tank and in the field. We found that P. interruptus make a 'rasp' sound once physically contacted by an aggressor, rather than during the approach. The model predator and conspecific elicited no discernable changes in defensive behaviour, but the responses by the lobsters to aggressors in the tank versus field were distinct. Our results indicate that the spiny lobster's rasp is used as a startle or aposematic signal, which may be coupled with visual aposematism of their spines. Alternatively, the rasp may function as a vibratory escape mechanism or as an acoustic analogue to eye-spots. This study offers insights into the role of acoustic signalling in the marine environment and demonstrates a central role for sound production in spiny lobster ecology. © 2009 Brill.

AB  - The purpose of this note is to introduce an experimental technique to overcome ductile failure in uniaxial extensional flow and show a simple illustration of its effectiveness. Ductile failure prevents the rheological measurement of transient stress growth at higher strains for certain strain-hardening materials. This reduces the accuracy of nonlinear parameters for constitutive equations fit from transient stress growth data, as well as their effectiveness in modeling extensionally driven processes such as film casting. We propose an experimental technique to overcome ductile failure called encapsulation in which the material that undergoes ductile failure is surrounded by a resin that readily deforms homogeneously at higher strains. The materials are arranged in concentric cylinders and are deformed in parallel. A simple parallel model is shown to calculate the viscosity of the core material and is tested for its robustness in a linear low-density polyethylene/low- density polyethylene system in which the viscosities of each resin are known at all strains, strain rates, and temperatures investigated. Agreement is found at each strain rate investigated across all strains studied. The method is then extended to measure the viscosity of a sparsely branched high-density polyethylene (HDPE) system that undergoes ductile failure at higher strain rates. The technique shows good agreement with experimental results up to the onset of ductile failure in the pure resin and predicts viscosity growth of the HDPE resin well beyond the critical strain for the onset of failure seen in experimental measurements of the pure HDPE. Repeatability of the technique is also illustrated. © 2009 The Society of Rheology.

AB  - Background: A Q-fever outbreak occurred in an urban area in the south of the Netherlands in May 2008. The distribution and timing of cases suggested a common source. We studied the spatial relationship between the residence locations of human cases and nearby small ruminant farms, of which one dairy goat farm had experienced abortions due to Q-fever since mid April 2008. A generic geographic information system (GIS) was used to develop a method for source detection in the still evolving major epidemic of Q-fever in the Netherlands.Methods: All notified Q-fever cases in the area were interviewed. Postal codes of cases and of small ruminant farms (size >40 animals) located within 5 kilometres of the cluster area were geo-referenced as point locations in a GIS-model. For each farm, attack rates and relative risks were calculated for 5 concentric zones adding 1 kilometre at a time, using the 5-10 kilometres zone as reference. These data were linked to the results of veterinary investigations.Results: Persons living within 2 kilometres of an affected dairy goat farm (>400 animals) had a much higher risk for Q-fever than those living more than 5 kilometres away (Relative risk 31.1 [95% CI 16.4-59.1]).Conclusions: The study supported the hypothesis that a single dairy goat farm was the source of the human outbreak. GIS-based attack rate analysis is a promising tool for source detection in outbreaks of human Q-fever. © 2010 Schimmer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This study was undertaken to examine the role of interset stretching on the time course of acceleration portion AP and mean velocity profile during the concentric phase of 2 bench-press sets with a submaximal load (60% of the 1 repetition maximum). Twentyfive college students carried out, in 3 different days, 2 consecutive bench-press sets leading to failure, performing between sets static stretching, ballistic stretching, or no stretching. Acceleration portion and lifting velocity patterns of the concentric phase were not altered during the second set, regardless of the stretching treatment performed. However, when velocity was expressed in absolute terms, static stretching reduced significantly (p <0.05) the average lifting velocity during the second set compared to the first one. Therefore, if maintenance of a high absolute velocity over consecutive sets is important for training-related adaptations, static stretching should be avoided or replaced by ballistic stretching. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - The incidence and heat resistance of conidiospores produced by dermatophytes isolated from athlete's kits (canvasses, stockings and spike shoes) stored in Nigerian University Sport's Centre were investigated. Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum oudouinii, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton concentricum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum were isolated and their incidence on the athlete's kits varied with the species and type of kits. Among the isolates T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum and E. floccosum with 25%, 23% and 20% prevalence rates respectively, were the most common isolates, and are often associated with tinea pedis (athletes foot). Canvasses with the highest incidence of dermatophytes (25 out of 34 fungal isolates) were the most contaminated kits and could serve as effective articles for the transmission of tinea pedis among athletes in Nigeria. The common etiological agents screened, produced asexual spores (conidiospores) that exhibited high resistance to heat treatment at 80 °C. Of the three isolates, E. floccosum, with a decimal reduction time (D-value) of D 80 = 4.4 min was the most resistant followed by T. mentagrophytes with D 80= 4.0 min and then T. rubrum with D 80= 3.2 min. The spores elimination pattern indicates that increasing the heating duration would decrease the decimal reduction time and possibly denature the fungal propagules but may damage the skin during treatment with hot water compresses. The findings have shown that the use of hot water compresses is palliative but heat treatment especially vapour-heat treatment offers adequate preventive measures if applied for periodic treatment of contaminated kits. However, determining the correct condition for effective decontamination will require detailed understanding of the heat resistance of fungal spores. Otherwise treatment of kits with detergent and chaotropic agent such as urea and guanidinium salt is preferred to heat treatment. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó.

AB  - Introduction and purpose: The shoulder complex muscles play an important role in force, power and endurance production in volleyball, allowing the accomplishment of movement in a coordinated manner. The objective written account produced by isokinetic evaluations assists in the diagnosis and prevention of shoulder complex injuries. In addition, it is a useful tool in promoting safe and fast return of the injured athlete to sports practice. The purpose of this study was to analyze the isokinetic muscle performance of the lateral and medial rotators of the glenohumeral joint in Brazilian male volleyball teams (under-19 and under-21). Methods: The protocol used during the test included five maximum repetitions of shoulder lateral and medial rotation in concentric-concentric mode at 60°/s and 30 repetitions at 360°/s. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the dependent variables: maximum work and maximum torque of shoul- der lateral and medial rotators normalized by body mass, antagonist/agonist ratio at the two speeds and muscular fatigue index. Results: Data analysis demonstrated an imbalance between the shoulder lateral and medial rotators (antagonist/agonist ratio) in the under-21 category of the Brazilian volleyball athletes, demonstrating relative weakness of the lateral rotators. Conclusion: It was possible to identify changes in volleyball players, which added to specific demands of the sport, can lead to symptoms in the shoulder complex and/or decrease of performance.

AB  - The optical configurations of off-axis spherical lens and off-axis correcting lens imaging spectrometer are designed. Based on the optical system of off-axis spherical lens imaging spectrometer, the spectrometer with off-axis lens is designed. This system adopts an off-axis lens in order to adjust large field aberration and avoids large diameter concentric lens. One prism corrects nonlinear dispersion and meets the request of spectral resolution. Distortion is controlled through adjusting off-axis angle and mirrors' focus, which compensate spectral curve and decrease residual aberration. It is easy to reduce production difficulty. The characteristic of two systems is discussed from the aspects of engineering layout, production difficulty and image quality. And the result of spectral nonlinear and slit curve is shown. The minimum modulated transfer of off-axis spherical lens system is 75 percent better than the value 60 percent of off-axis correcting lens. The front system uses a silica lens which diameter is larger than 200 mm. The material uniformity and surface precision of the latter system is far better than the front system, and the production difficulty is decreased. The latter system considers the matching with mechanical structure, and it is more feasible for the distance between slit and the first mirror of latter system. The spectral resolution of front system is close to the latter, and the slit curve of the front system is slightly better than the latter system. The comparison shows that the latter is optimal optical layout, and it can be applied to remote sensing working at short wavelength.

AB  - A quasisteady multimode heat-transfer model for boiler concentric-tube overfire air ports has been developed that predicts the effect of geometry, furnace heat source and heat sink temperatures, axial injector wall conduction, and coolant flow rate on the tube wall temperature distributions. The model imposes a radiation boundary condition at the outlet tip of the ports, which acts as a heat source. The model was validated using field data and showed that both the airflow distribution in the ports and tube diameter can be used to control the maximum tube wall temperature. This helps avoid tube overheating and thermal degradation. For nominal operating conditions, highly nonlinear axial temperature distributions were observed in both tubes near the hot outlet end of the port. © 2009 by ASME.

AB  - In April 2007, Piton de la Fournaise volcano experienced a caldera collapse during its largest historical eruption. We present here a structural analysis both of the caldera and the surrounding area, and precise GPS data recorded with a dense GPS network specifically dedicated to the analysis of deformation related to the summit collapse structures. Despite a collapse of more than 300 m in the central zone, the geometry of the new caldera is similar in map view to that of the pre-existing collapsed structure, which was formed from the coalescence of several pit craters. The caldera shows an asymmetric inner geometry with sub-vertical walls in the NW quadrant and steep scarps composed of inward tilted blocks in the southern half. The presence of preserved polished surfaces on the lower part of the sub-vertical scarp indicates that it corresponds to the caldera north-western ring fault. The April 2007 caldera collapse led to the development and the reactivation of concentric fractures on the caldera rim, mostly along the southern limit of the caldera. GPS data show that fractures result from radial extensional stresses that are restricted within the first tens of meters of the caldera edge. GPS data also reveal that the caldera collapse was coeval with a centripetal deflation, whose magnitude is largest along the southern half of the caldera. The displacements recorded by GPS result from both a general deflation, due to magma withdrawal from Piton de la Fournaise's summit magma chamber, and additional local effects related to the caldera collapse. Comparison of the caldera collapses at Piton de la Fournaise, Miyakejima and Fernandina reveals striking similarities, with cyclic seismic signals accompanying small-scale deflation-inflation cycles. This strongly suggests a common mode of collapse. Hence, we propose a unifying model of caldera collapse in basaltic setting, in which the inward deflation due to magma withdrawal from the magma chamber prevents the collapse of the caldera roof until the gravitational stress acting on the rock column above the magma chamber exceeds the shear strength along pre-existing ring faults. The downward displacement stops when the pressure increase into the magma chamber is able to again sustain the rock column. The succession of (1) inward deflation that prevents the collapse, (2) collapse due to gravitational stress and (3) stopping of the downward motion is repeated many times. The frequency of the cycles is influenced by the rate of magma withdrawal and by the amount of intrusion of magma along the ring faults. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managed Pressure Drilling has been proven to be a tool for extending access to previously unattainable drilling targets in many deepwater areas across the world, such as deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 21'' Low-Pressure risers do not allow for application of Constant Bottom Hole Pressure (CBHP) technique by floaters. Since it is not designed to hole the pressure, it prevents setting up a closed circulation loop in our drilling system which is an essential tool for MPD. A high-pressure riser along with a surface Rotating Control Device is required to perform CBHP drilling technique. However, we know that deployment of such high pressure risers in long lengths and harsh environments has not come to be An alternative drilling method from floaters at any water depth proves to be Reelwell Drilling Method (RDM). Reelwell AS Shell StatoilHydro, and the Research Council of Norway launched a JIP in 2005 to develop RDM, which is a riserless drilling method based on concentric drill pipe. Mud is circulated in a closed loop in this system. The pressure and flow of mud is dynamically controlled by a computer system on the return path on the surface. Many tests including the latest pilot test in March 2009 has proven that the downhole pressure can be controlled precisely and that the system fits perfectly for CBHP. Deployment of this technology by smaller floating rigs is possible with no limitation on water depth as huge and long 21'' LP riser is eliminated from the system. The volume of mud is limited to bring about even more cost and rig space savings. Copyright 2009, SPE/IADC Middle East Drilling Technology Conference & Exhibition.

AB  - During November 2000, a collection of acanthocephalans from birds in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, included a new genus and species in a new family and order. Pyrirhynchus heterospinus n. gen., n. sp. (Pyrirhynchidae n. fam.: Heteramorphida: new order) is described from Actitis hypoleucos (Linnaeus, 1758) (common sandpiper). The new family combines characters from Polymorphidae and Heteracanthocephalidae, and it includes new features. Specimens of the new species are distinguished from those of Heteracanthocephalidae and/or Polymorphidae by their long cylindrical trunk with anterior swelling, pyriform proboscis with hooks much larger ventrally, brain at the anterior end of the receptacle, specialized tubular cement glands, and elliptoid eggs with concentric shells. A detailed analysis of proboscis and trunk armature is included, and specimens of several species of Arhythmorhynchus Lühe, 1911 (Polymorphidae) were studied for comparative purposes. The proboscis of P. heterospinus is armed with 17 to 20 rows of 17 to 19 hooks each, with anterior 9-11 hooks rooted and posterior 6-10 spines rootless. © American Society of Parasitologists 2008.

AB  - Well-preserved pillow lavas in the uppermost part of the Early Archean volcanic sequence of the Hooggenoeg Formation in the Barberton Greenstone Belt exhibit pronounced flow banding. The banding is defined by mm to several cm thick alternations of pale green and a dark green, conspicuously variolitic variety of aphyric metabasalt. Concentrations of relatively immobile TiO2, Al2O3 and Cr in both varieties of lava are basaltic. Compositional differences between bands and variations in the lavas in general have been modified by alteration, but indicate mingling of two different basalts, one richer in TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, FeOt and probably Ni and Cr than the other, as the cause of the banding. The occurrence in certain pillows of blebs of dark metabasalt enclosed in pale green metabasalt, as well as cores of faintly banded or massive dark metabasalt, suggest that breakup into drops and slugs in the feeder channel to the lava flow initiated mingling. The inhomogeneous mixture was subsequently stretched and folded together during laminar shear flow through tubular pillows, while diffusion between bands led to partial homogenisation. The most common internal pattern defined by the flow banding in pillows is concentric. In some pillows the banding defines curious mushroom-like structures, commonly cored by dark, variolitic metabasalt, which we interpret as the result of secondary lateral flow due to counter-rotating, transverse (Dean) vortices induced by the axial flow of lava towards the flow front through bends, generally downward, in the tubular pillows. Other pillows exhibit weakly-banded or massive, dark, variolitic cores that are continuous with wedge-shaped apophyses and veins that intrude the flow banded carapace. These cores represent the flow of hotter and less viscous slugs of the dark lava type into cooled and stiffened pillows. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Adult life spans of insects are part of supposedly adaptive life-history syndromes, which involve a variety of reproductive strategies with regard to mating, egg maturation and egg laying. Contingencies of life span with many other morphological, behavioural, and ecological traits are to be expected. We used a data-mining approach, incorporating controls for phylogeny, to uncover broad patterns of trait contingencies in a literature-derived data set of adult life spans for 350 butterfly species. We found that adult feeding habit has strong links with life spans, with pollen-feeders living longer than fruit feeders, which in turn live longer than nectar feeders. Furthermore, traits reducing susceptibility to predators (i.e. aposematism, eye-spots) are associated with longer life. Mud-puddling behaviour as a means of gaining access to minerals, and possibly nitrogen, was generally associated with a short life. We also found strong impacts of the region of occurrence of species (i.e. whether they were tropical or temperate taxa), but received conflicting results depending on whether we analysed field data (longer life in the tropics) or data from caged individuals (shorter life in the tropics). Adult longevity was associated with the growth form of larval host plants (higher on lianas as opposed to herbs, shrubs, or trees), whereas other larval host plant traits did not have strong links with species' life spans. We discuss the hypothetical evolutionary mechanisms explaining those patterns and suggest predictions that could be tested in further research. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.

J Strength Cond Res 23(4): 1077-1083, 2009-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a field-based injury prevention exercise on eccentric hamstring strength during simulated soccer match play. Sixteen semiprofessional soccer players (age 21.3 ± 2.9 years; height 185.0 ± 8.7 cm; body mass 81.6 ± 6.7 kg) completed the Soccer-specific Aerobic Field Test (SAFT90), a multidirectional 90-minute exercise protocol representative of soccer match play. Subjects performed 3 maximal dominant-limb isokinetic contractions at 120°·s-1 for concentric knee extensors (conQ) and flexors (conH), and eccentric knee flexors (eccH) before SAFT90 (t 0), at half-time (t45), and immediately after the SAFT90 (t105). After baseline testing, subjects were divided into 2 groups, either performing Nordic hamstring eccentric strengthening exercises during the cool-down (CD) or warm-up (WU) of twice-weekly training sessions. After an 8-week intervention program, the baseline testing was repeated. The WU group displayed a significant increase postintervention in eccH gravity-corrected peak torque (PT) and the functional eccH:conQ ratio at t0 (p < 0.01), a significantly greater improvement compared with CD group (p < 0.05). Conversely, the CD group displayed a significant increase in both eccH PT and the functional eccH:conQ ratio postintervention at t45 (p < 0.05) and at t105 (p < 0.05), which were significantly greater increases compared with the WU group (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that the training intervention had a time-dependent beneficial effect on eccentric hamstring strength and that strength training conducted posttraining significantly reduced the negative influence of fatigue. © 2009 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - An engraved block from the cave of Abauntz is interpreted as a Magdalenian map in which the actual surrounding landscape, including mountains, rivers, and ponds, is represented. Some possible routes or avenues of access to different parts of the geography are also engraved on the landscape. The engraving seems to reproduce the meandering course of a river crossing the upper part of side A of the block, joined by two tributaries near two mountains. One of these is identical to the mountain that can be seen from the cave, with herds of ibex depicted on its hillsides, on both sides of the gorge in front of which the cave of Abauntz is strategically located. In the southern part of the gorge, there is a completely flat area where the watercourses slow down, forming meanders and flooding in springtime. The following elements are also represented on the block: tangles of concentric strokes and bundles of lines forming very marked meanders. In short, all of these engravings could be a sketch or a simple map of the area around the cave. It could represent the plan for a coming hunt or perhaps a narrative story of one that had already happened.

AB  - Endoluminal therapy is indicated in lower extremity ischaemia with Fontaine grades IIb, III and IV. In the presence of significant limitations, interventions are carried out even in grade IIa claudicants. In addition to the TASC A and B lesions, TASC C and D lesions are increasingly being treated endoluminally as well. Presently, technical success rates of revascularization procedures are above 90% in the iliac vessels and between 79% and 95% in the femoro-popliteal segments. Concentric, non-calcified iliac stenoses are primarily treated with balloon angioplasty (PTA) followed by optional stenting when necessary. For occlusions and heavily calcified lesions, primary stenting is recommended. Primary PTA is the mainstay of treatment in femoro-popliteal vessels with stents being used as a "bail-out" option in case of suboptimal PTA. However, initial reports proving the superiority of primary stenting over PTA with optional stenting have already appeared. Results of PTA with drug-coated balloons for prevention of early restenosis are promising. In the near future, primary PTA with optional stenting in the femoro-popliteal segments may give way to drug-coated balloon angioplasty or primary stenting. © 2010 Springer Medizin Verlag.

AB  - Background: Hamstring injuries are common in sprinters. Identifying preseason risk factors is essential to target injury-prone athletes and develop injury preventive measures. Objective: To investigate the incidence of hamstring muscle injury in sprinters over an athletic season and to explore the preseason predictor of this injury. Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants: 44 sprinters from the Hong Kong Sports Institute, the Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association and intercollegiate athletic teams were recruited. Methods: Preseason assessment of hamstring flexibility, concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque and peak torque angle were obtained at the beginning of an athletic season. The athletes were followed over 12 months and were asked to report all injuries resulting from training and competition. Results: Eight athletes sustained hamstring injuries over the season. The injury rate was 0.87 per 1000 h of exposure. The incidence of injuries was higher at the beginning of the season, with 58.3% injuries occurring in the first 100 h of exposure. Cox regression analysis revealed that athletes with a decrease in the hamstring : quadriceps peak torque ratio of less than 0.60 at an angular velocity of 180°/s have a 17-fold increased risk of hamstring injury. Conclusion: Performing preseason hamstring : quadriceps peak torque ratio assessments may be useful to identify sprinters susceptible to hamstring injury.

AB  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are a phenotypically coordinated array of scales whose color is determined as cellular interpretation outputs for morphogenic signals. Here we investigated distribution patterns of scale shape and size in relation to position and coloration on the hindwings of a nymphalid butterfly Junonia orithya. Most scales had a smooth edge but scales at and near the natural and ectopic eyespot foci and in the postbasal area were jagged. Scale size decreased regularly from the postbasal to distal areas, and eyespots occasionally had larger scales than the background. Reasonable correlations were obtained between the eyespot size and focal scale size in females. Histological and real-time individual observations of the color-pattern developmental sequence showed that the background brown and blue colors expanded from the postbasal to distal areas independently from the color-pattern elements such as eyespots. These data suggest that morphogenic signals for coloration directly or indirectly influence the scale shape and size and that the blue "background" is organized by a long-range signal from an unidentified organizing center in J. orithya. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In strong earthquake events, multi-story concentrically braced steel frames (CBFs) are prone to form a story-collapse mechanism after buckling and yielding of the braces in a story. With the addition of continuous gravity columns and the increased lateral stiffness and strength they provide, however, it becomes possible to reduce the concentration of story drift and prevent the story collapse. Nonlinear dynamic analysis is implemented for a three-story CBF, and it is demonstrated that a drift concentration is inevitable, particularly in the first story, when the CBF is subjected to a set of large ground motions with a probability of exceedance of 2% in 50 years. A simplified theoretical formulation is presented to characterize the effect of gravity columns. Two cases are considered: gravity columns perfectly fixed, and gravity columns pinned at the base. It is noted that significant mitigation of drift concentration can be achieved, particularly when gravity columns are fixed at the base. Nonlinear time-history analysis is further performed to validate the theoretical observations and quantify the stiffness/strength demands of gravity columns to avoid drift concentration. The analysis results support the trends and observations obtained from the theoretical formulation. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented with the seismic force reduction factor D s, slenderness ratio of braces λ, and number of stories, as major analysis variables. The results demonstrate that a few (e.g. four) fixed-base gravity columns can lead to collapse prevention for reasonably designed low-rise CFBs under the set of large ground motions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an ongoing research project on the seismic performance of concentrically braced steel frames of the Conventional Construction category designed according to NBCC 2005 and CSA-S16 seismic provisions. These structures are expected to remain essentially elastic during strong ground motions. Linear time history analyses were performed on typical braced steel frames of this category to assess the force demand on brace connections. Different building heights were considered. The structures were assumed to be located in both eastern and western Canada to reflect two different seismic conditions. Two local soil conditions were also examined: site classes C and E. The computed force demand varied with the building height, the location and the site class. In several cases, it exceeded the predictions from multi-modal response spectrum analysis, which is mainly attributed to the assumptions made on damping and higher mode response. Recommendations on design forces are given to prevent brittle failure of brace connections. © 2010 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper describes the design and development of a new specific RF probe dedicated for the MRI of both proton (1H) and hyperpolarized Xenon-129 (HP 129Xe) in the rat brain. This probe consists of a double-tuned (100 MHz-27 MHz) volume coil, that could be used for both transmitting and receiving, and of a receive-only simple-tuned (27 MHz). The receive-only coil is a surface coil which is decoupled form the volume coil by an active decoupling circuitry based on the use of PIN diodes. The double-tuned volume coil consists of two concentric birdcage resonators. The inner one is of type low-pass and tuned to 27 MHz, while the outer one, tuned to 100 MHz, is of type high-pass. A transmit/Receive (T/R) driver was realized to bias the PIN diodes in both volume and surface coils. The developed prototype was validated at 100 MHz and at 264 MHz. Fist obtained MRI images show the feasibility of our approach. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions-in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities. © 2010 Olofsson et al.

AB  - Transformation acoustics opens a new avenue towards the design of acoustic metamaterials, which are materials engineered at the subwavelength scale in order to mimic the parameters in wave equations. The design of the acoustic cloaking is based on the property of equations being invariant under a coordinate transformation, i.e. a specific spatial compression is equivalent to a variation of the material parameters in the original space. In this paper, the sound invisibility performance is discussed for spherical cloaks. The original domain consists of alternating concentric layers made from piezoelectric ceramics and epoxy resin, following a triadic Cantor sequence. The spatial compression, obtained by applying the concave-down transformation, leads to an equivalent domain with an inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of the material parameters. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

AB  - In animal eyes of the camera type longitudinal chromatic aberration causes defocus that is particularly severe in species with short depth of focus. In a variety of vertebrates, multifocal optical systems compensate for longitudinal chromatic aberration by concentric zones of different refractive powers. Since a constricting circular pupil blocks peripheral zones, eyes with multifocal optical systems often have slit pupils that allow light to pass through all zones, irrespective of the state of pupil constriction. Birds have circular pupils and were therefore assumed to have monofocal optical systems. We examined the eyes of 45 species (12 orders) of bird using videorefractometry, and the results are surprising: 29 species (10 orders) have multifocal systems, and only five species (five orders) have monofocal systems. The results from 11 species (four orders) are inconclusive. We propose that pupils 'switching' between being fully opened (multifocal principle) to maximally closed (pinhole principle) can make multifocal optical systems useful for animals with circular pupils. Previous results indicate that mice have both multifocal optical systems and switching pupils. Our results suggest that parrots may use a similar mechanism. By contrast, owl pupils responded weakly to changes in illumination and stayed remarkably wide even in full daylight. Moreover, the parrots opened their pupils at higher light levels than owls, which correlates with the differences in sensitivity between diurnal and nocturnal eyes.

AB  - In this work a novel type of high temperature solar collector is designed: the rotating solar boiler. This rotating solar boiler consists of two concentric tubes. The inner tube, called absorber, absorbs sunlight and boils water. The outer transparent tube, called cover, is filled with air. The boiler rotates to completely prevent convection in the insulating air layer in between the tubes. In this way, the heat loss is reduced considerably resulting in a solar collector that is more efficient than conventional flat plate solar collectors. The prototype built measured 1.20 m length and 0.50 m diameter (illuminated area is 0.60 m2) for the copper absorber with high performance sputtered coating. The cover with a diameter of 0.90 m was made of transparent polyvinylchloride film. The rotation speed was 60 rpm. The efficiency was 61% and the boiler delivered 0.34 kW of 100 o°C steam at an ambient temperature of 7 o°C. A model was developed to predict the performance of the prototype. The model predicts an efficiency of 62%, which is in agreement with the measured experimental efficiency. An economical analysis was performed as well. The rotating solar boiler is much cheaper than conventional evacuated tube collectors, especially because the rotating solar boiler is lightweight. © 2009 by ASME.

AB  - A novel three-dimensional Cartesian cut cell algorithm, referred to as 6+N, is proposed to describe and treat arbitrary three-dimensional Kitta Cube. This method can avoid the enumeration for millions of cutting patterns and implement the discretization and solution of the N-S equations in a unified form. The present method is applied to simulate natural convection heat transfer in an annular tunnel between two concentric or eccentric spheres. The numerical results show that Kitta Cube can express curve surfaces accurately with an error of less than 1.0%. The accuracy of solutions obtained by the present method is approximately equivalent to that by the body-fitted method. In addition, higher overall heat transfer coefficients can be achieved by lowering the position of the inner sphere for eccentric arrangement.

AB  - Background. The orthoreoviruses are infectious agents that possess a genome comprised of 10 double-stranded RNA segments encased in two concentric protein capsids. Like virtually all RNA viruses, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme is required for viral propagation. RdRp sequences have been determined for the prototype mammalian orthoreoviruses and for several other closely-related reoviruses, including aquareoviruses, but have not yet been reported for any avian orthoreoviruses. Results. We determined the L2 genome segment nucleotide sequences, which encode the RdRp proteins, of two different avian reoviruses, strains ARV138 and ARV176 in order to define conserved and variable regions within reovirus RdRp proteins and to better delineate structure/function of this important enzyme. The ARV138 L2 genome segment was 3829 base pairs long, whereas the ARV176 L2 segment was 3830 nucleotides long. Both segments were predicted to encode B RdRp proteins 1259 amino acids in length. Alignments of these newly-determined ARV genome segments, and their corresponding proteins, were performed with all currently available homologous mammalian reovirus (MRV) and aquareovirus (AqRV) genome segment and protein sequences. There was ∼55% amino acid identity between ARV B and MRV 3 proteins, making the RdRp protein the most highly conserved of currently known orthoreovirus proteins, and there was ∼28% identity between ARV B and homologous MRV and AqRV RdRp proteins. Predictive structure/function mapping of identical and conserved residues within the known MRV 3 atomic structure indicated most identical amino acids and conservative substitutions were located near and within predicted catalytic domains and lining RdRp channels, whereas non-identical amino acids were generally located on the molecule's surfaces. Conclusion. The ARV B and MRV 3 proteins showed the highest ARV:MRV identity values (∼55%) amongst all currently known ARV and MRV proteins. This implies significant evolutionary constraints are placed on dsRNA RdRp molecules, particularly in regions comprising the canonical polymerase motifs and residues thought to interact directly with template and nascent mRNA. This may point the way to improved design of anti-viral agents specifically targeting this enzyme.

AB  - This chapter presents several measures that need to be taken to avoid vibration problems, focuses on troubleshooting excessive vibration, and introduces vibration analysis and noise analysis. It is required to adequately balance all rotating components of diameter equal to at least one-third of the pump impeller diameter to avoid vibration problems. The entire rotor system should be check-balanced in the assembled condition. Accurate alignment is necessary to make the centerline of the driving and driven equipment coincide as closely as possible both in concentricity and parallelism. Design piping and pump supporting structures (including floors) should have natural frequencies that are at least 25% less or 25% more than the operating range of the key excitation frequencies in the pump. Rotordynamic analysis of the pump, compressor, or fan rotating system should be performed by the manufacturer or a third-party consultant. In performing vibration troubleshooting, generalized charts for matching symptoms to possible causes could be useful for many typical or simple problems but it is recommended not to rely too heavily on such lists, especially if their initial application does not lead to an immediate resolution of the problem. Vibration test data are usually plotted in three different forms that include a Cartesian plot of vibration amplitude versus frequency, a Cartesian plot of vibration amplitude versus time, similar to a typical oscilloscope trace, and a polar plot of vibration versus time in a plane perpendicular to the shaft axis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes an efficient technique for the rendering of large terrain surfaces. The technique is based on a simple rings structure: a sequence of concentric rings at different resolutions andcenteredon the viewer's position. Each ring is represented by a set of patches at identical resolutions. Rings near the viewer have a finer resolution than the rings further from the viewer. At runtime, the patches within the rings change resolution based on the viewer's position. The GPU decodes in real time height maps encoded by a fractal compressor from which sample the height component of the terrain. Since adjacent patches of different rings can disagree on the resolution of common edge GPU stitches the meshes in order to avoid any cracks or degenerate triangles. The rendered meshes ensure the absence of cracks that may cause the appearance of visual artifacts. In addition, a tile manager support is evaluated in order to maintain terrain datasets on disk storage avoiding a costly load of the entire datasets into the memory. © The Eurographics Association 2008.

AB  - Sammon mapping is an approach of nonlinear dimension reduction and can be used for visualization. To avoid numerical complexity of the algorithm of traditional Sammon mapping, Kovacs and Abonyi (2004) proposed a modified Sammon mapping method. However, this improvement can only be applied to fuzzy clustering results. By using the property of Fermat point, we develop a new method in this article that can be applied to any clustering results. Different from other methods of visualization, we transfer information of clustering results into concentric circles around the Fermat points. So our procedure can demonstrate the data structure in a more informative way and the clustering results become easier to understand, especially for nonprofessionals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is studied by application to a real data in this article. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the world, bone tuberculosis is still very difficult to treat and presents a challenge to clinicians. In this study, we utilized 3D printing technology to fabricate a programmed release multi-drug implant for bone tuberculosis therapy. The construction of the drug implant was a multi-layered concentric cylinder divided into four layers from the center to the periphery. Isoniazid and rifampicin were distributed individually into the different layers in a specific sequence of isoniazid-rifampicin-isoniazid-rifampicin. The drug release assays in vitro and in vivo showed that isoniazid and rifampicin were released orderly from the outside to the center to form the multi-drug therapeutic alliance, and the peak concentrations of drugs were detected in sequence at 8 to 12 day intervals. In addition, no negative effect on the proliferation of rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was detected during the cytocompatibility assay. Due to its ideal pharmacologic action and cytocompatibility, the programmed release multi-drug implant with a complex construction fabricated by 3D printing technology could be of interest in prevention and treatment of bone tuberculosis. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) for the synthesis of the low sidelobe concentric ring arrays. The MPSO has been utilized to optimize the element placement in a concentric ring array to obtain the lowest peak sidelobe level (PSLL). And here the multiple optimization constraints include the array aperture, the minimum ring spacing and the element spacing in each ring. Unlike standard PSO using fixed corresponding relationship between the optimal variables and their coding, the MPSO utilized the coding resetting of optimal variables to avoid infeasible solution during the optimization process. Also, the proposed approach has reduced the size of the searching area of the PSO by means of indirect description of individual. The simulated results confirming the great efficiency and robustness of this algorithm are provided in this paper. © 2009 VSP.

AB  - This chapter broadly covers the sensory photoreceptors and light control of flagellar activity wherein behavioral light responses, light signaling elements, rhodopsins as photoreceptors and blue light sensitive flavin-based photoreceptors are elaborated. Chlamydomonas displays distinct behavioral responses to light. The most basic responses are directional changes of swimming upon absorption of single photons. The first part defines the behavioral light responses and introduces the strains. It also includes various methods of studying the behavioral light responses. The rhodopsins absorb red photons of the intensive monitoring light with significant efficiency. In bright-field microscopy, the eyespot is seen peripherally near the cell's equator as a conspicuous, single orange-red spot. The study of sensory photoreceptors in Chlamydomonas is especially appealing because the reactions can be triggered both in vivo and in vitro with unparalleled precision. Seven rhodopsins, two cryptochromes, and one phototropin have been identified as sensory photoreceptors in Chlamydomonas. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe a method to establish chronologies of ancient ribosomal evolution. The method uses structure-based and sequence-based comparison of the large subunits (LSUs) of Haloarcula marismortui and Thermus thermophilus. These are the highest resolution ribosome structures available and represent disparate regions of the evolutionary tree. We have sectioned the superimposed LSUs into concentric shells, like an onion, using the site of peptidyl transfer as the origin (the PT-origin). This spherical approximation combined with a shell-by-shell comparison captures significant information along the evolutionary time line revealing, for example, that sequence and conformational similarity of the 23S rRNAs are greatest near the PT-origin and diverge smoothly with distance from it. The results suggest that the conformation and interactions of both RNA and protein can be described as changing, in an observable manner, over evolutionary time. The tendency of macromolecules to assume regular secondary structural elements such as A-form helices with Watson-Crick base pairs (RNA) and α-helices and β-sheets (protein) is low at early time points but increases as time progresses. The conformations of ribosomal protein components near the PT-origin suggest that they may be molecular fossils of the peptide ancestors of ribosomal proteins. Their abbreviated length may have proscribed formation of secondary structure, which is indeed nearly absent from the region of the LSU nearest the PT-origin. Formation and evolution of the early PT center may have involved Mg 2+-mediated assembly of at least partially single-stranded RNA oligomers or polymers. As one moves from center to periphery, proteins appear to replace magnesium ions. The LSU is known to have undergone large-scale conformation changes upon assembly. The T. thermophilus LSU analyzed here is part of a fully assembled ribosome, whereas the H. marismortui LSU analyzed here is dissociated from other ribosomal components. Large-scale conformational differences in the 23S rRNAs are evident from superimposition and prevent structural alignment of some portions of the rRNAs, including the L1 stalk.

AB  - The beautiful color patterns decorating butterfly wings have been and continue to be inspirational for studies of a variety of biological issues, ranging from systematics and evolution to developmental genetics and biochemistry of pigmentation. The amazing diversity of these patterns, together with knowledge on their adaptive value and underlying developmental basis, make them a favorite system in the relatively new field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo (Nijhout 1991; Beldade and Brakefield 2002; McMillan, Monteiro, and Kapan 2002; Joron et al. 2006; Parchem, Perry, and Patel 2007; Wittkopp and Beldade 2009). © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - During the Late Middle Ages, faction formation in Flemish cities was largely determined by both international and local political and socio-economic relationships or oppositions and conflicts concerning honour and interests between rivalling elite networks. The 'factions' of the Flemish patricians often had a concentric pattern, with a core - usually closely interconnected by means of family ties - and a sympathising periphery, supporting the core for economic, political, or ideological reasons. The reasons why corporative middle groups supported factions are sometimes hard to fathom. The sources show that patrician factions often feared the middle classes and manual workers. These were able to punish newly elected leaders severely if they did not live up to their - sometimes great - expectations. The stakes of such conflicts were high, which probably explains their intensity as well as the increasingly frequent interventions by the state. Although the growing political influence of the Burgundian dynasty in the urban faction struggle in Flanders must be recognized, it can be disputed whether growing state power ensured less 'private violence'. On the contrary, it seems that the Dukes often consciously 'participated' in faction struggles in order to reinforce sovereign power in the city.

AB  - In this study, non-symmetric flow problems are modeled by selecting subdomains and shifting them in such a way that the symmetry is recovered. As a result, the domains are made of simple grid structures and re-generation of mesh is avoided. Three test problems with various decomposition characteristics, namely, translation, rotation and deformation are selected, and they are analyzed in different flow regimes. To study the internal flow between eccentric cylinders, two cylindrical concentric subdomains are considered, one translated relative to the other. Hence, a simple polar-coordinates mesh can be utilized instead of generating a mesh for the solution domain between the eccentric cylinders of the original problem. External flow around a curvature tube is studied shifting the subdomain around the object in rotation, relative to the outer domain thus avoiding a re-generation of the mesh as the angle-of-attack changes. A third example involves deformation of an object exposed to natural convection, and the shifting of the domain facilitates the iteration process as the object deflects. Systems of nonlinear equations are solved within Newton-Krylov framework using the matrix-free approach. Geometrical and physical parameters are used to improve the solution process. Several results are provided to show the applicability of proposed method. © Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, 2010.

AB  - In this paper, a digital watermarking system based on vector quantization is presented. Each vector containing N samples is mapped on the surface of the hyperspheres each of which are associated with a message to embed the digital watermark. We called this method Vector Quantization Index Modulation (VQIM) since it is conventional QIM in the N-dimensional space. The performance of the method and its comparison to orthogonal code-based watermarking is investigated. Furthermore, we implemented the VQIM method on a real audio watermarking system and adopted it with the human auditory system. The experimental results show the robustness of this scheme against common attacks in audio watermarking such as MP3 compression, lowpass filtering, resampling etc. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - A simple and commercial readily-available approach that enables the direct use of ionic liquid (IL)-based single-drop microextraction (SDME) prior to gas chromatography (GC) is presented. The approach is based on thermal desorption (TD) of the analytes from the IL droplet to the GC system, by using a robust and commercially-available thermodesorption system. For this purpose, a two-glass-tube concentrically disposed system was designed. The inner tube is a laboratory-cut Pyrex tube (20 mm length) that houses the ionic liquid droplet from the SDME process, and the outer tube is a commercially-available TD glass tube (187 mm length) commonly employed for stir-bar sorptive extractions (SBSE). In this way, the proposed device prevents IL from entering the GC system, as this could dirty the inlet or even block the column. The determination of 10 chlorobenzenes in water samples by GC coupled with mass spectrometric (MS) detection has been chosen as model analytical application, showing the feasibility of the proposed approach. The SDME process consists of a 5 μL droplet of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C6MIM][PF6]) suspended in the headspace (HS) of a 10 mL stirred sample. After extracting for 37 min at room temperature, the IL droplet is directly placed into the small inner tube, which is placed into the TD tube. The whole device is placed inside the TD unit, where desorption of the analytes is performed at 240 °C for 5 min with a helium flow rate of 100 mL min-1. The analytical figures of merit of the proposed IL-(HS)-SDME-TD-GC-MS approach are very suitable for the determination of chlorobenzenes at ultratrace levels, with relative standard deviation values ranging between 2% and 17%, and limits of detection ranging between 1 and 4 ng L-1, showing the potential offered by the IL-based SDME process with GC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Original omnidirectional images usually need to be unwrapped to cylindrical panoramic images according to human visual habits because of concentric annular distortion. According to the characteristics of catadioptric omnidirectional imaging, an interpolation method for panoramic unwrapping based on bidirectional mapping was proposed. The coordinate mapping relationships were obtained by tracking optical path. Firstly, each pixel in the target cylindrical panoramic image was projected backward onto the original omnidirectional image, and the neighboring pixels for interpolation were located. Then, all the neighboring pixels were projected forward onto the cylindrical panoramic image, and the color value of the target pixel was interpolated by using inverse distance weighted method or 3D-plane interpolation method due to the scattered distribution of the neighboring pixels in cylindrical panoramic images. The proposed method avoids the adverse effect on computing the interpolation weight of neighboring pixels caused by the nonlinear distortion, and the neighboring pixels for interpolation are also accurately located. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective for enhancing the precision of interpolation and the image quality of unwrapped panoramic images.

AB  - According to the most modern trend, performance-based seismic design is aimed at the evaluation of the seismic performance of structures in terms of mean annual frequency of exceeding a threshold level of damage, i.e. a limit state. A procedure for performance-based seismic assessment is herein briefly summarised and applied to concentrically "V" braced steel frames, designed according to different criteria. In particular, two design approaches are examined. The first one corresponds to the provisions suggested by Eurocode 8, while the second approach, proposed by the authors, is based on a rigorous application of the capacity design criteria aiming at the control of the failure mode. In addition in this work a new conception of bracing members is developed and applied with reference to V-braced frames designed according to the methodology proposed by the authors. It is well known that aiming at the safeguard of brace connections, Eurocode 8 provides a limitation to the brace slenderness. The drawback of this limitation is the oversizing of brace diagonals at the upper storeys, which prevents the development of a collapse mechanism of global type. This is the starting design issue for the conception of new bracing members. In fact, by introducing in the brace members a zone characterized by a reduction of the cross sectional area (Reduced Section Solution), it is possible to calibrate the yield strength leaving substantially unchanged the slenderness, so that the limits provided for the normalized slenderness can be still satisfied without brace oversizing. The aim of this work is to focus on the seismic performance of V-braced frames designed according to both Eurocode provisions and the proposed methodology. For the structures dimensioned according to the proposed criteria, the Reduction Section Solution is also applied with the aim to safeguard the connection without increasing the structural weight. Finally, a probabilistic approach based on the combination of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) and probabilistic seismic capacity analysis (PSCA) is applied aiming to investigate the seismic performance of the designed structures. It is pointed out how the proposed design method leads to a very important improvement of the seismic performances with a negligible increase of the overall building cost.

AB  - Morphological defenses against predators range from cryptic coloration, which minimizes the probability of detection, to weaponry used to fight back when attacked. These defenses may be fixed traits or inducible ones. Inducible defenses are expected to evolve when the cost of having the morphological defense in the absence of predators is high, when predator presence is variable through space or time, and when predator presence can be detected via a reliable cue. Morphological defenses typically work in conjunction with behavioral responses, often leading to correlated evolution of traits. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Variation of eye-spots in the wing pattern of Coenonympha pamphilus (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied in the Urals with adjacent territories and in Dzhelal-Abad Province of Kyrgyzstan. Discriminant analysis of the wing length and eye-spot diameter and the phenetic distances calculated by the Hartman's method revealed clinal variation of the characters. The butterflies in the northern parts of the range (Sverdlovsk and Kurgan Provinces) are smaller than those in the south (Orenburg and Chelyabinsk Provinces) and have fewer eye-spots which themselves are smaller. The Kyrgyzstan specimens differ significantly from the Ural ones (the nominotypical subspecies) in both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the wing pattern, and should probably be assigned to the subspecies C. pamphilus marginata Heyne, 1894. As in most Satyridae, females of C. pamphilus are larger than males and on the average possess more eye-spots on the wings. The degree of phenotypic variation in natural populations was studied using the method of variation spectra (Kovalenko, 1996a, 1996b, 2007, etc.). The arrangement of phenotypic combinations within the theoretical spectrum (St) matrix allows one to describe the actual (Sr) and potential (Sp) spectra for either sex and for the species as a whole. The actual spectrum was found to be considerably broader in males than in females. With minor variations, Sr and Sp showed the same general trends in different samples of both sexes. In all the samples, phenetic combinations with one spot on the fore wing (in cell M 1-M 2) were predominant. The hind wing had either no spots (which was typical of males, especially in the northern parts of the range) or the maximum possible number, six (mostly in females, more often in the southern parts of the range). The phenetic combinations with the maximum (4) number of spots on the fore wing and the minimum number (0) on the hind wing are prohibited for C. pamphilus. © 2008 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - In the context of its responsibilities as a Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for the Southwest Indian Ocean, Météo-France operates a tropical cyclone warning centre which sends advisories to all the concerned countries in the area. In assistance to the forecasters and as part of the operational suite for the short-range forecasts, a limited-area model (ALADIN Réunion) is run with four daily analyses. Assimilated observations include conventional observations - radiosondes, buoys, surface stations, aircraft reports, upper-wind reports - and satellite observations. The latter include QuikSCAT surface winds, atmospheric motion vectors from geostationary satellites, and radiances from polar-orbiting satellites. Assimilation of satellite radiance data is done in clear-sky conditions, and thus cannot be used in the vicinity of tropical cyclones. Two new sources of pseudo-observations are investigated that can bring new information content to those regions: Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) pseudo-observations deduced from cloudy/rainy SSM/I data, as well as a 3D wind bogus. The TCWV algorithm is obtained from SSM/I brightness temperatures through a simple statistical regression from the 1D-Var analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which are derived from complex inversion methods using moist physics and radiative transfer models. The 3D wind bogus is derived from structural information contained in the tropical cyclone advisories issued by the RSMC and contains a low-level vortex composed of two concentric rings of eight winds each, at each of the surface, 850, 700 and 500 hPa levels. Forecast scores and fit of the model to the observations are improved and indicate a positive impact of those new datasets. Structural validation is investigated through the comparison of model and TMI 'observed' rain rates: it is found that assimilating and cycling cloudy/ rainy TCWV helps achieve more realistic cyclonic features.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish the isokinetic profile of shoulder rotator muscles strength in female handball players. Twenty-seven handball players performed concentric and eccentric strength tests of both dominant and non-dominant upper limbs on an isokinetic dynamometer. Internal and external rotator muscles peak torque was assessed at 1.05, 3.14, and 5.23 rad · s-1 in concentric mode and at 3.14 and 5.23 rad · s-1 in eccentric mode. Concentric balance ratio and functional ratio were obtained. Bi-lateral deficiency was compared. Concentric strength for internal and external rotation was significantly greater for the dominant than for the non-dominant limb for all speeds (P ≤ 0.0001). For eccentric actions, internal rotator muscles were stronger in the dominant than the non-dominant limb (P ≤ 0.0001) at both speeds. Concentric balance and functional balance ratios did not differ between sides at 3.14 rad · s-1 (P = 0.1631), but at 5.23 rad · s-1 the functional balance ratio in the dominant limb was lower than for the non-dominant limb (P = 0.0500). Although the dominant side was stronger than the non-dominant side, balance concentric ratios remained the same, with only the functional strength ratio different at 5.23 rad · s-1. Our results suggest that concentric strength exercises be used for internal and external rotators on the non-dominant side, and functional exercise that improves eccentric rotation strength for prevention programmes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We have measured high-precision Hf, Nd, and Pb isotope compositions for 40 samples from the final leg of the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP) core using solution chemistry and MC-ICP-MS. The new isotope data are indistinguishable from those higher up in the Mauna Kea part of the core. The Pb isotope data define three linear trends with a common intersection. Principal component analysis recognizes no more than three geochemical end-members among these trends. When all the Pb isotope data acquired so far for the HSDP core are pooled, two contrasting groups stand out. A first coherent, prevalent group represents the Kea main eruptive sequence. This group combines the Kea-mid8 and Kea-lo8 subgroups of Eisele et al. (Eisele, J., Abouchami, W., Galer, S.J.G., Hofmann, A.W., 2003. The 320 kyr Pb isotope evolution of Mauna Kea lavas recorded in the HSDP-2 drill core. Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 4, doi: 10.1029/2002GC000339): although defining two separate trends in Pb-Pb isotope space, they follow each other smoothly in time. A second group of 14 flows below 2000 mbsl is characterized by distinctly higher source Th/U and high 3He/4He. These samples belong to the Kea-hi8 group and are about 0.4 (Hf) and 0.5 (Nd) ε units below the main sequence Kea values. The toggle between these two groups is so sharp and repetitive and the gap between the values so conspicuous that the alternation must reflect eruptions from distinct volcanic centers, those of Mauna Kea and an unknown volcano, the latter of which bears isotopic resemblance to Kilauea for Nd and Hf and to Loihi for He. This 'lost' volcano stopped erupting about 550 ka ago, i.e., 200 ka before the oldest known ages for Kilauea, and is presently buried under 2000-3000 m of Kea flows. Periodograms show no wavelengths exceeding the 95% significance level (white spectrum). Except for a few minor wiggles in Hf at shallow depth, the isotopic signals display overall smooth up-core variations with little short-distance variability. Analysis of the flow regime within the plume conduit shows that temperature dependence of viscosity makes the conduit narrow and sharply bound. The hot core is highly mobile with minimum shear rates and a regime of pipe (Poiseuille) flow. The core is rimmed by a sheath of colder, strongly stretched material (filaments). A broadly concentric zoning of the plume is expected. The white spectra suggest, however, that, at any given depth within the plume conduit, lateral mixing results from the rheological variability across the plume conduit. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Healing wounds are commonly examined by pathologists at the time of reexcision of skin tumors to ensure complete removal of the lesion. In addition to searching for residual tumor, possible perineural invasion must be assessed. During routine examination of reexcision specimens, 10 cases of prominent perineural proliferation were seen associated with fine nerves in the mid or deep dermis. The process showed a concentric cellular proliferation with no, or only limited, nuclear hyperchromasia or pleomorphism. In a number of cases, immunohistochemistry was essential to exclude the possibility of malignant perineural invasion or other mimics of this process such as reexcision perineural invasion. The term reparative perineural hyperplasia is proposed for this entity, which is important for pathologists to be aware of to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - We study the fully three-dimensional Stokes flow within a geometry consisting of two infinite cones with coincident apices. The Stokes approximation is valid near the apex and we consider the dominant flow features as it is approached. The cones are assumed to be stationary and the flow to be driven by an arbitrary far-field disturbance. We express the flow quantities in terms of eigenfunction expansions and allow for the first time for nonaxisymmetric flow regimes through an azimuthal wave number. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for successive wave numbers. Both real and complex sequences of eigenvalues are found, their relative dominance affecting the flow features observed. The implications for the presence of eddy-like structures (analogous to those found in other corner geometries) are discussed and we find that these flow features depend not only upon the internal angles of the two cones but also upon the symmetry of the driving mechanism. For an arbitrary disturbance, the dominant flow mode is not axisymmetric but rather is associated with wave number one and, by breaking axisymmetry, eddies can be avoided in this geometry. © The author 2009.

AB  - he prescription of eccentric loading is considered as a mainstay of non-operative rehabilitation programmes for mid-substance chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Such exercises have some degree of clinical utility in comparison with concentric training and are often referred to as a strengthening programme. Yet the dose parameters of the eccentric loading do not reflect an optimal strengthening programme and specifically avoid the normal eccentric-concentric coupling typical of the stretch shortening cycle. This manuscript identifies the arguments and counterarguments for why eccentric loading rehabilitation is not an optimal strengthening programme. It is proposed that such exercises reflect a specific stretching programme directed at the passive structures. This has two important clinical implications. Firstly, this reinterpretation of the role of eccentric exercises may direct future research into the underlying mechanisms of tendinopathy and, secondly, it may reinforce the importance of adjunct sports specific strengthening programmes.

AB  - This study aimed to analyse the effect of age on muscle peak torque (PT), and Hamstring (H): Quadricep (Q) ratio in elite youth footballers. To date, no study has considered age-group playing level and pubertal development in this population. One hundred and fifty-seven elite youth footballers in the age groups U12 to U18 volunteered to participate in this study, 133 of these were further grouped for pubertal development. Prior to testing subjects completed separate familiarisation, a three minute cycle ergometer warm up (resistance 5060W), and two sub-maximal repetitions. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic PT measures for reps 24 of H and Q muscle action were taken at 60°s(1). From this, conventional and functional H: Q ratio was calculated along with dominant: non dominant ratio for the concentric Q and H, and eccentric H conditions. Significant main effects were observed for the age/pubertal development group and PT in all muscles and conditions (P<0.05). Of particular interest was a significant main effect for age and Functional H: Q (P<0.05), which suggested a move away from equality at U18. Our study provides normative data for coaches, trainers and clinicians working with youth footballers and may also have connotations for injury prevention and performance.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of taping and preventive bracing on functional balance, jumping performance, multi-joint coordination and proprioception on comparison to barefoot and each other. Design: Controlled trial as an experiment with the independent variable testing in 3 trials: control (barefooted), preventive bracing, and taping. Setting: The sports physiotherapy research laboratory. Participants: Twenty physically active male university students aged between 20 and 28 who had been free from lower extremity pathology for 12 months and had no previous history of ankle sprain served as participants. Main outcome measures: Single leg balance (s), jumping performance (cm), coordination and proprioception assessments by the Functional Squat System. The software automatically calculated the absolute average error (cm) and the standard deviation (SD) of the average error. Average errors were independently quantified as a function of the action mode (concentric versus eccentric) and of the lower limb (dominant versus non-dominant). Results: There was no significant difference among the groups for balance tests (p > 0.05). For vertical jump performance of bilateral and the dominant leg there were significant differences that the barefoot group had better results compared to the other groups (p = 0.059; 0.017). According to the coordination results of Functional Squat System participants were better in brace and tape situations since the deviations were less for all concentric and eccentric positions. Deviation results for the proprioception test were different for first visual and non-visual deviations for dominant leg (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, bracing and taping may play an important role in preventing injury or rehabilitation of the injured ankle by improving concentric and eccentric coordination, proprioception with the ability of reproducing motion in closed kinetic chain while decreasing vertical jump performance. No superiority of brace over tape or vice versa was found in this study. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - This paper proposes a frequency compounding method to reduce speckle interferences, where a concentric annular type high-frequency dual element transducer is used to broaden the bandwidth of an imaging system. In frequency compounding methods, frequency division is carried out to obtain sub-band images containing uncorrelated speckles, which sacrifices axial resolution. Therefore, frequency compounding often deteriorates the target-detecting capability, quantified by the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), when the speckle's SNR (SSNR) is not improved as much as the degraded axial resolution. However, this could be avoided if the effective bandwidth required for frequency compounding is increased. The primary goal of the proposed approach, hence, is to improve SSNR by a factor of two under the condition where axial resolution is degraded by a factor of less than two, which indicates the total SNR improvement to higher than 40% compared to that of an original image. Since the method here employs a dual element transducer operating at 20 and 40 MHz, the effective bandwidth necessary for frequency compounding becomes broadened. By dividing each spectrum of RF samples from both elements into two sub-bands, this method eventually enables four sets of the sub-band samples to contain uncorrelated speckles. This causes the axial resolution to be reduced by a factor of as low as 1.85, which means that this method would improve total SNR by at least 47%. An in vitro experiment on an excised pig eye was performed to validate the proposed approach, and the results showed that the SSNR was improved from 2.081 ± 0.365 in the original image to 4.206 ± 0.635 in the final compounding image. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article explores the nightmares of Cambodian refugees in a cultural context, and the role of nightmares in the trauma ontology of this population, including their role in generating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among Cambodian refugees attending a psychiatric clinic, we found that having a nightmare was strongly associated with having PTSD (χ2 = 61.7, P < 0.001, odds ratio = 126); that nightmares caused much distress upon awakening, including panic attacks, fear of bodily dysfunction, flashbacks and difficulty returning to sleep; that nightmare content was frequently related to traumatic events; that nightmares resulted in a decrease in the sense of "concentric ontology security" (i.e., in an increased sense of physical and spiritual vulnerability in a culture that conceives of the self in terms of concentric, protective layers), including fears of being attacked by ghosts; and that nightmares frequently led to the performance of specific practices and rituals aiming to extrude and repel attacking forces and to create "protective layers." Cases are presented to illustrate these findings. The Discussion considers some treatment implications of the study. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Ocean circulation plays an important role in global climate change. In an effort to monitor ocean circulation an infrastructure of more than 3,000 buoys have been deployed in the open water to measure ocean salinity and temperature variations. Some of these data are made freely available by Argo. The focus of this study is extracting previously unknown patterns of abnormal ocean salinity and temperature variations from Argo data that can be further applied to predict ocean current variations. First, Argo data are converted to market-basket type data that are used to find temporal-spatial association rules. The discovered rules reveal the associations of abnormal ocean salinity and temperature variations. Next, the discovered temporal and spatial variation patterns are used to predict future ocean salinity and temperature variations surrounding Taiwan. A 3-D visualization model is developed to present a) the interactions between events at different dates, concentric circles and ocean depths, and b) relationships between ocean temperature and salinity variations. The proposed 3-D visualization model help researchers determine whether the ocean temperature and salinity variations occurred in the same water mass and the relative importance of each attribute. Having established the informative relationships among different attributes an early warning system for climate changes can be established such that their impact on property and loss of life is reduced. The discovered association rules are compared with traditional association rules to illustrate their strength in analyzing global climate change. Copyright © 2009 ACM.

AB  - Plasma-sprayed Al2O3 interlayer was prefabricated between the bondcoat and topcoat in thermal barrier coatings. It can prevent oxygen penetration through the interconnected porosity in the topcoat, so that the TGO (thermally grown oxide) growth and the failure can be suppressed. But, prefabricated Al2O3 interlayer will result in interfacial stress redistributing. Basing on three-dimensional shape of thermal barrier coatings, using elastic sphere model, considering topcoat, interlayer, TGO and bondcoat, have developed a four-concentric-sphere model of three-dimensional, and produced the relevant analytical model. The analysis of anti-oxidation layer for the concave and convex asperity, indicate that the method can simulate the effect of interlayer on the interfacial microstructure's stress distributing of thermal barrier coatings.

AB  - The emissions reduction in diesel and kerosene flames using a novel fuel injector called as flow-blurring in combustion system was tested in a swirl-stabilized combustor operated at atmospheric pressure. The test apparatus consisted of a combustor assembly and the injector assembly where the air enters through a plenum filled with marbles to break down the large vertical structures. The liquid fuel is supplied to the injector with separate concentric tube inlets for fuel and atomization air, equipped with an O-ring within a sleeve to prevent leakage. The experiment kept the fuel rate and total air as constant, and employed diesel and kerosene thereof. The results presented an increase in the atomization airflow rate that further reduce the CO emissions as the premixed mode of combustion becomes more prevalent. Reduction in emission can be attributed to the smaller droplets produced by injector creating an effervescent effect at the nozzle exit.

AB  - The ecosystem of wetlands has precious natural environment to be preserved in the world. In order to sustain valuable wetlands ecosystems for a long time, it is very important to frequently monitor the state of wetland ecosystems, to carefully watch the environment, and to earlier warn the environmental change. In this research, using high spatial resolution of color photographs taken with a 35 mm non-metric camera mounted on the cabled balloon flown over the high moor near Akanuma in Kushiro wetland, characteristics of spatial distribution of wetland plant communities are studied in terms of application and interpretation of remote sensing data for wetland environment monitoring using geostatistics, texture analysis, and landscape metrics. Outcomes of this research are summarized as follows. 1. An ultra fine and reliable vegetation map, of which nominal spatial resolution is 2cm by 2cm, with 40 plant community types at the time of the summer in 1998 was originally created, which is covering about 15ha of the high moor, for the baseline map for ecological studies near Akanuma. 2. The optimal spatial resolution for monitoring vegetation in this area by remote sensing is smaller than a half meter. 3. Concentric spatial distribution of typical wetland plant community groups is clearly distinguished and confirmed in the ultra fine vegetation map through visual interpretation and spatial analysis using GIS application tools. 4. Results of this research show that remote sensing of high spatial resolution greatly serves for wetland environment monitoring and wetland studies.

AB  - Experiments in humans have shown that changes in emotional (affective) state cause adaptive changes in the processing of incoming information, termed "cognitive bias". For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with "pessimistic" judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling "threat call" (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds' behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enigmatic structures in the shape of invetted rounded cones are very common in a discrete horizon of the upper Stoner Limestone Member (Stanton Limestone Formation, Lansing Group, Upper Pennsylvanian) in southeastern Nebraska. These structures are 100-300 mm in diameter, but rare, very large examples attain 1300 mm in diameter. On bedding planes, individual structures are conspicuously expressed as groups of concentric rings, some of which appear as low ridges (rugae). At least some of these rings correspond to concentric cone sheets (hollow cones) extending downward into the rock mass; these cone sheets are sometimes separated clearly from each other by discontinuous mud linings or drapes. The largest structures usually have smaller ones nested within them. The Stoner Limestone structures differ from described types of nonbiologlcal and biological conelike structures, yet they must have formed in soft sediment prior to burial. Although they have a superficial similarity to such plug-shaped trace fossils as Conichnus and Conostichus, the purported dwelling traces left by cnidarians, several salient points with respect to shape, structure, and occurrence distinguish the Stoner Limestone structures from such traces. A trace-fossil hypothesis for the origin of the structures remains plausible - possible feeding structures - albeit problematic. Study of the Stoner Limestone concentric-conelike structures indicates that careful reexamination of trace fossils and sedimentary structures in Midconinent Pennsylvanian limestones is in order, as well as a reconsideration of how unique physical and diagenetic properties of carbonate sediments in general might affect the preservation of such features.

AB  - Butterfly wing color patterns can be changed by the application of a temperature shock or pharmacological agents such as tungstate, producing a distinctive type of elemental modification called the TS (temperature shock) type. Heterochronic uncoupling between the signaling and reception steps during the color-pattern determination process has been proposed as a mechanism for TS-type changes. As an extension of this hypothesis, both the parafocal element (PFE) and the eyespot in the same wing compartment are considered to be determined by morphogenic signal(s) emitted from the same eyespot focus. However, these models need to be examined with additional experimental data. Furthermore, there is controversy as to whether the action of tungstate on wing color patterns is direct or indirect. Using a species of nymphalid butterfly (Junonia orithya), we have devised a simple method for the local application of pharmacological agents directly on developing wings of pupae. Local tungstate application resulted in reduced eyespots and circular dislocated PFEs in the eyespot-less compartments only on the treated wing, demonstrating that tungstate directly induces color-pattern changes on wings. We further examined the eyespot-PFE relationship in normal and cold-shocked individuals, showing that an eyespot can be superimposed on a PFE and vice versa, probably depending on the timing of their fate determination. Taken together, we propose a two-morphogen model for the normal color-pattern determination, in which the morphogenic signals for the eyespot and PFE are different from each other despite their identical origin. This two-morphogen model is compatible with the heterochronic uncoupling model for TS-type changes. © 2009 Zoological Society of Japan.

AB  - Fungicides are routinely used to prevent yield losses in winter wheat in southern Sweden. Yield and 1000 grain weight (TGW) data from 432 trials in farmers' fields were evaluated to review long-term yields (1977-2005) and control of eyespot and Leaf Blotch Diseases (LBDs, including Septoria tritici blotch, Stagonospora nodorum blotch and tan spot), powdery mildew, brown rust and yellow rust. Regression analyses revealed that control of LBDs explained 74% of the yield increase achieved by fungicide treatment at GS 45-61, followed by powdery mildew (20%), brown rust (5%) and yellow rust (1%). Yield of both untreated and fungicide-treated plots increased from approx. 6000 to 12 000 kg ha-1 over the period 1983-2005. Single eyespot treatment improved yield by ∼320 kg ha-1 yr-1 during the period 1977-2002, mainly due to occasional years with severe eyespot. Single leaf disease treatment at GS 45-61 increased mean yield by 10.3% or 810 kg ha-1 yr-1 (9.9% or 660 kg ha-1 yr-1 for 1983-1994 and 10.7% or 970 kg ha-1 yr-1 for 1995-2005) due to increased TGW and grain numbers, especially in high-yielding stands. Additional extra early treatment at GS 30-40 against LBDs increased yield by ∼250 kg ha-1 yr-1. Estimated variance in yield and TGW was higher between years than within years, while that in yield increase and plant diseases was lower between years than within. The results confirm potential and limits of fungicides and the need for supervised control strategies including factors affecting disease, yield and interactions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This chapter presents several measures that need to be taken to avoid vibration problems, focuses on troubleshooting excessive vibration, and introduces vibration analysis and noise analysis. It is required to adequately balance all rotating components of diameter equal to at least one-third of the pump impeller diameter to avoid vibration problems. The entire rotor system should be check-balanced in the assembled condition. Accurate alignment is necessary to make the centerline of the driving and driven equipment coincide as closely as possible both in concentricity and parallelism. Design piping and pump supporting structures (including floors) should have natural frequencies that are at least 25% less or 25% more than the operating range of the key excitation frequencies in the pump. Rotordynamic analysis of the pump, compressor, or fan rotating system should be performed by the manufacturer or a third-party consultant. In performing vibration troubleshooting, generalized charts for matching symptoms to possible causes could be useful for many typical or simple problems but it is recommended not to rely too heavily on such lists, especially if their initial application does not lead to an immediate resolution of the problem. Vibration test data are usually plotted in three different forms that include a Cartesian plot of vibration amplitude versus frequency, a Cartesian plot of vibration amplitude versus time, similar to a typical oscilloscope trace, and a polar plot of vibration versus time in a plane perpendicular to the shaft axis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Under the compressive load on the manual hip joint prosthesis, when the femur and prosthesis were considered as concentric cylinders with perfectly bonded interface, a relatively perfect theoretical model simulating the interfacial stress transfer was established, and distributions of the interfacial shear and radial stresses with the axial positions were obtained. The maximum interfacial shear stress occurs at the position of z = 0, namely, the cross section of the femur neck. The interfacial shear stress decreases exponentially with the increasing of z. It is important to keep the interfacial shear stress of the prosthesis/femur interface along the axial direction of the prosthesis constant and balanced with the pressure load at the position of z = 0 on the prosthesis, thus local stress concentration and prosthesis sink can be avoided. When the shear stress values within the region of 0<z< 0.1 m were assumed to be equal to that at the position of z = 0.1 m,distributions of the prosthesis radius a with the axial positions were calculated, providing a theoretical reference for the design of the surface size of the prosthesis.

AB  - Objective: The agonist-antagonist strength relationship for shoulder external rotation and internal rotation was formerly described by the relatively more functional ratios of eccentric external rotator to concentric internal rotator moments, and eccentric internal rotator to concentric external rotator moments for the entire range of motion. The aim of this study was to provide descriptive data for terminal range eccentric antagonist/concentric agonist rotator cuff strength in overhead athletes. Method: The dominant and non-dominant shoulders of 40 asymptomatic military overhead athletes were tested through a range of 20° of external rotation to 90° of internal rotation using the Cybex NORM isokinetic dynamometer at a speed of 90°/s. Differences between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders were assessed using the paired samples t-test. Results: The terminal range ratios during external rotation (20° of internal rotation - 10° of external rotation) were found to be 2.09 and 1.58 for the dominant and non-dominant shoulders, respectively, whereas the terminal range ratios during internal rotation (60-90° of internal rotation) were 1.03 and 1.19 for the dominant and non-dominant shoulders, respectively. These ratio differences between the dominant and non-dominant shoulders were significant (P<0.01 for external and internal rotation). Conclusion: The muscle torque ratios of eccentric antagonist/concentric agonist are different between dominant and non-dominant shoulders of skilled overhead athletes at terminal ranges. This functional assessment of strength testing that reflects dynamic shoulder joint stability during the throwing activity at these specific ranges may provide valuable information either during preventive exercise programs or in the evaluation of the injured shoulder of the overhead athlete. We recommended functional exercises that improve eccentric external rotation strength on the dominant shoulder during the rehabilitation and prevention programs in overhead athletes.

AB  - Silicon (Si) affects the susceptibility of plants to fungal attack. In plants with low Si accumulation, disease-control mechanisms involve the accumulation of phenolic compounds and Si. This study compared the effects of calcium silicate and carbonate doses on the control of soybean (Glycine max) diseases. A sandy soil was collected from Santa Vitória, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, of which 200 kg was placed in plastic drums in a protected, uncovered area. Calcium carbonate or silicate was applied superficially in amounts equivalent to 0, 1500, 3000, 6000, or 12,000 kg ha-1, and soybean was cultivated for 120 d. Leaf Si concentration and incidence of Cercospora sojina (Frog's eye spot), Peronospora manshurica (downy mildew), and Phakopsora pachyrhizi (Asian rust) were evaluated. Calcium carbonate did not reduce disease incidence; however, calcium silicate was effective in the reduction of downy mildew at 47 and 66 d after soybean seeding, and of frog's eye spot incidence at all dates evaluated. Asian rust was observed only at 79 d after seeding and calcium silicate was not effective in its reduction. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Previous algorithms for recovering 3D geometry from uncalibrated circular motion image sequences of unknown rotation angles are mostly for constant intrinsic parameters. In this paper, a new and simple method for recovering circular motion geometry in spite of varying intrinsic parameters is proposed. It is shown that the movement of the camera forms two concentric circles on the motion plane. By identifying the concentric conic loci in 3D projective frame, the geometry of circular motion can be recovered. Compared with existing rotation angle recovery methods, the new method is (i) more flexible in that it allows the intrinsic parameters to vary from image to image; (ii) simpler by avoiding the calculation of the intersection points of two conies which is notoriously complicated. Experimental results for real images are provided to show the performance of the proposed method. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Economic segregation, or residential inequalities based on income, is a complex spatial process. It is associated with structures which arise at certain scales and which evolve in time. In this paper, we analyse the evolution of economic segregation in Montréal from 1980 to 2000. This analysis is based on household's income and on their distribution within the residential space from four scales: households, census tracts, municipalities and some radio-concentric zones. Results confirm that the spatial organisation of economic segregation is scale dependent. More precisely, local inequalities are growing more rapidly but this trend does not prevent the consolidation of metropolitan-sized clusters. Moreover, results confirm that Montréal's economic segregation follows North American trends like the growth of economic disparities (spatial or not) or the fact that the enrichment of central and ex-urban neighbourhoods is compensated by the impoverishment of inner-ring suburbs. © / Canadian Association of Geographers.

AB  - According to the characteristics of the iris image, a new algorithm, which takes the center of the pupil as a reference point to sample the special region of interest (ROI) of iris image is proposed. This algorithm also designs the radius parameters of Hough transform based on the physiological character of iris, and it chooses the best matching result that was achieved from Hough transform, for the inner and outer circles of an iris are approximately concentric. This algorithm is helpful to avoid the interference of eyelid and eyelash and reduce the calculation of Hough transform remarkably. The 108 groups iris location test by using the images of CASIA was finished. The result shows that the average location time is 0.83 s, and the location accuracy rate is as high as 98.9%.

AB  - Eyespots are repeated elements in the wing pattern of butterflies. In the speciesrich genus of Bicyclus, all eyespots are formed by the same developmental process. Artificial selection in B. anynana has explored how readily two of the eyespots can become different to each other. There is sufficient standing genetic and developmental variation in a single stock of this species for high flexibility in the responses for eyespot size; indeed selection over 25 generations in several directions of morphospace yielded phenotypes far beyond the variability found in the whole genus. In contrast, experiments on another eyespot trait, their colour composition, indicate that comparable flexibility occurs only along the axis of least resistance in which both eyespots change in the same direction. This result is reflected in both a clear difference in the developmental regulation of eyespot size and colour composition, and in the patterns of variability among species. Such research that integrates evolutionary genetics and Evo-Devo will eventually reveal how evolutionary tinkering occurs in both genetical and developmental terms, and will also explore the consequences of differences in evolvability for patterns of diversity. © Novartis Foundation 2007.

AB  - The Orinoco Oil Belt is the largest heavy oil accumulation in the world with 1.2 trillion of in situ reserves in an area of 54.000 square kilometers covering the southern portions of three states in the Eastern Venezuela Basin. Carabobo is one of its more prospectives areas with very thick sands with excellent petrophysical properties. The study area has 120 square kilometers corresponding to the Extraheavy Oil Unit of the Morichal District, Monagas State. In the early 80s explotation began in this area with drilling of 150-300 meters spaced vertical wells. Further secondary recovery method (including alternate vapor injection) evaluations were conducted in order to enhance a more commercial production. In late 80s and early 90s the new uprising drilling technology was used in the area, with 400 meters spaced deviated and inclined wells where further alternate vapor injection was applied. In the late 90s and 2000s drilling campaigns of horizontal wells and multilateral wells, respectively, were performed in the study area, with very dense drilling of heavy and extra-heavy oil sand reservoirs with horizontal wells of extended section that generated a very problematic large sand production. Thus, reaconditioning and cleaning up of these wells was needed in order to optimize oil and sand production within desired levels avoiding the damage of equipments after completion. Cleaning up of horizontal wells gets difficult due to circulation loss, high permeabilities and low reservoir pressure; therefore use of the 2 3/8" tail tubing was substituted by the new Concentric Coiled Tubing (CCT) technology and a Vacuum pump. CCT was tested in selected wells where it was used; evaluating parameters such as oil sand petrophysics, production behavior, cleaning up services conditions and associated costs during productive life of wells. The main results of using CCT are prolonging recurrent sanding that implies short term recurrent cleaning up services, avoiding additional expenses in repair services, equipment replacements or well closure among other disadvantages. Repair services result in money waste, disturbance of routine operational field activities and subsequent costs increase of produced barrel due to restrictions in production. Economic indicators have shown evident rentability of using this tool in horizontal wells of Extraheavy Oil Unit of Morichal District. Copyright 2006, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The effectiveness of a visual birdscarer, the Peaceful Pyramid®, relative to a much‐cheaper eye‐spot balloon was investigated experimentally in two vineyards in Canterbury, New Zealand. Monitoring of bird damage to natural bunches of Riesling grapes within vineyard blocks showed that the rate of starling (Sturnus vulgaris) damage to the crop was reduced significantly by the balloon relative to pyramid and control plots. Nevertheless, after 24 days of monitoring, birds in the balloon plot had damaged 75% of the grapes, respectively (cf. 84% in the pyramid plot). In a second trial, clusters of table grapes were attached to vineyard wire at a Lincoln vineyard. The balloon and pyramid both reduced bird damage to clusters within 15 m of the device, but had no measurable effect on clusters further away. We conclude that neither device would provide growers with any economically significant reduction in grape damage. This study highlights the importance of undertaking quantitative assessments of the numerous bird‐scaring technologies presently available to growers. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2008.

AB  - The spatial FFT processing used in Near-field Acoustical Holography (NAH) makes the method computationally efficient, but it introduces severe spatial windowing effects, unless the measurement area is significantly larger than the source. To avoid the need for these very extended measurement areas, Patch Holography techniques have been developed to provide acceptable accuracy based on measurements that only partially cover the source area. Calculation and mapping is then performed over a corresponding concentric patch, typically on the source surface. One such method performs an iterative analytic continuation of the measured pressure beyond the measurement area, followed by the use of standard NAH procedures. Two other methods completely avoid the use of spatial FFT, and instead they perform a least squares fit of a local sound field model to the measured sound pressure data. Statistically Optimized Near-field Acoustical Holography (SONAH) uses a local plane wave model, whereas the Helmholtz Equation Least Squares (HELS) method applies a local spherical wave model. The present paper gives first a short introduction to the HELS and the SONAH methods, with the aim of highlighting similarities and differences between the two methods. Then, the accuracy of the two methods is compared through a set of simulated measurements.

AB  - Use of the word"popular"attached to the term"religion" or"Catholicism"is quite current in the area of the social sciences. Those terms tend to introduce a dichotomy in the field of religion. Despite all the warnings and recognition of the fact that it is a problematic epithet, most researchers still use it. Yet, and in opposition to that position, this work intends to show that a dichotomic view of Brazilian Catholicism fails to grasp all its dynamics and the tension between its plurality and its universality. Based on ethnographic experience among Catholics of the Casa Amarela neighbourhood (Recife-Brazil), and in establishing a dialogue with the literature produced on this subject, we herein propose a model of comprehension that aims to go beyond the usual dichotomic approach to this religion. This is done on the basis of an outlook wherein Brazilian Catholicism is seen as a concentric Catholicism. © 2007 Social Compass.

AB  - Intergenerational relations among in-laws are involuntary ties emerging as a consequence of marriage. As such, these relations provide a window through which the dynamics involved in restructuring social networks following life transitions may be observed. A questionnaire, based on the social convoy model, was given to an ethnically diverse sample of adults with living in-laws (N =170), married 2-15 years. About half of the respondents included in-laws in a concentric circle network diagram of persons close and important to them. The strongest unique predictors of convoy placement for the mother-in-law were support, frequency of contact, relationship quality, and length of marriage, and for the father-in-law were support, relationship quality, and value similarity. This study sheds light on the dynamics of an intergenerational relationship that has been largely ignored in the literature, laying the groundwork for conceptualizing ways to foster positive in-law relationships as a necessary tool in managing the care of the growing numbers of elderly in the new millennium. © 2007 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.

AB  - Chromatic dispersion of dual-concentric-core photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), which have an inner low-index core and an outer high-index core, is investigated based on a full vector finite-element method. Large negative dispersion can be obtained by introducing avoided crossing between modes of the two asymmetric cores. While increasing the negative dispersion, larger effective mode area is also possible by choosing a higher order mode in the outer core to couple with the fundamental inner core mode. During the analysis, a dual-core PCF with a dispersion peak value of -36000 ps/(nm · km) and effective mode area of 34.8 μm2 is presented. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - To analyze severe acute occupational poisoning accidents related to irritating gases reported in China between 1989 and 2003, and to study the characteristics of severe acute occupational poisoning accidents and provide scientific evidences for prevention and control strategies. The data from the national occupational poisoning case reporting system were analyzed with descriptive methods. (1) There were 92 severe acute occupational poisoning accidents related to asphyxiating gases during 15 years, which showed that there were 14.5 accidents occurred each year. Forty types of chemicals were reported to cause poisoning accidents directly. On average, there were 14.5 persons poisoned and 0.8 persons died of poisoning in each event. The number of death of poisoning reached 7 in most of the severe accidents. Chlorine was the main irritating gas resulting in poisoning accidents according to the number of accidents, cases and death. (1) The severe acute occupational poisoning related to irritating gases are more dangerous than others because of it is involved in more cases in each accident. (2) The accidents have concentricity in the certain types of chemicals, industries and jobs, and should be focused on control. (3) It is important to develop the program about early warning and forecast and the first aid.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac transplantation is a recognized therapy for end-stage heart failure. Graft coronary artery disease is a chief determinant of long-term survival following cardiac transplantation. There are multiple purported etiologies for graft coronary artery disease including both immunologic and nonimmunologic factors. Immunologic factors include human leukocyte antigen mismatching, cytokine production, and activation of the cellular immune system. Nonimmunologic factors include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cytomegalovirus infection, just to name a few. There are also donor and recipient factors including age, prior coronary artery disease in the donor heart, and mode of donor brain death. RECENT FINDINGS: The diagnosis of graft coronary artery disease is especially difficult, partially due to the de-innervated allograft, as well as to its inherent predilection to affect the medium-sized and smaller arteries in a concentric and diffuse nature. Conventional angiography can overlook this condition because of the lack of eccentric plaques in larger epicardial arteries. Intravascular ultrasonography, by contrast, is more sensitive in detecting graft coronary artery disease but is unable to visualize the entire arterial system. Treatment is challenging and often unrewarding, leading to re-transplantation. Prevention is therefore ideal and involves protection against endothelial injury before and during transplantation as well as after transplantation, with decreased ischemic time, aggressive attention to early rejection, risk factor modification, and close follow-up. SUMMARY: This review will look at the pathophysiology of graft coronary artery disease, current diagnostic and therapeutic choices, as well as existing and future directions. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - This paper summarizes a three-night observing campaign aimed at achieving millimagnitude-precision photometry of bright stars (V < 9.0 mag) with the 1 m Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. The test targets were the main-sequence stars HD 205739 and HD 135446. The results show that by placing a concentric diaphragm in front of the aperture of the telescope, it is possible to avoid saturation and achieve a photometric precision of 0.0008-0.0010 mag per data point, with a cadence of less than 4 minutes. It is also possible to reach an overall precision of less that 0.0015 mag for time series of 6 hr or more. The photometric precision of this setup is only limited by scintillation. Scintillation could be reduced, and therefore the photometric precision further improved, by using a neutral-density filter instead of the aperture stop. Given the expected median depth of about 0.01 mag for extrasolar-planet transits, plus their typical duration of several hours, the results of this paper show that 1 m telescopes equipped with standard CCDs can be used to detect planet transits as shallow as 0.002 mag around bright stars. © 2006.

AB  - Aim. Delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) often results from unaccustomed exercise or exercise that involves heavy eccentric loading of skeletal muscle. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and has been used widely in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Based on these findings, the investigators sought to determine whether CS supplementation might reduce DOMS symptoms associated with eccentric arm exercise. Methods. Sixteen non-resistance-trained males participated in a double-blind protocol. Subjects consumed 3 600 mg·day-1 of encapsulated CS or placebo for 14 days preceding the exercise protocol and during 48 hours of follow-up measurements. Subjects performed a maximum of 50 eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors against a resistance that was 120% of the concentric one-repetition maximum. Results. Significant time effects were present for soreness, relaxed elbow extension (joint angle), and creatine kinase; all measures were significantly altered 48 hours after the exercise session. No effects were present for complement system fragment C3a and prostaglandin E2. No significant treatment or interaction effects were detected for any of the variables. Conclusion. CS supplementation was not found to be effective in the prevention of DOMS, nor did it influence biochemical indices of inflammation and muscle damage following heavy eccentric loading of the arm flexors.

AB  - Thick layers of gallium nitride have been deposited on 1μm thick MOVPE GaN(0001) thin film substrates using a novel vertical iodine vapor phase epitaxy system. The system features three concentric flow zones that separate the reactant gasses until they reached the substrate. Nitrogen flows through the innermost zone and delivers iodine vapor from an external bubbler to the molten Ga maintained at ∼1040°C and Gal to the substrate; high-purity ammonia flows through the outermost zone; and nitrogen flows through the middle zone to prevent reaction between the growth species at the Gal nozzle. Growth rates greater than 75 μm/hr have been achieved at a V/III ratio of 75. The use of higher V/III ratios resulted in lower growth rates. Optical microscopy of the final growth surfaces revealed spiral hillocks with base diameters as large as 1mm. Increased Ga in the vapor phase resulted in a duplex microstructure containing both hillocks and faceted, oriented crystals overgrowing the hillocks. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Large eyespots on the wings of butterflies and moths have been ascribed generally intimidating qualities by creating a frightening image of a bird or mammal much larger than the insect bearing the eyespots. However, evidence for this anti-predator adaptation has been largely anecdotal and only recently were peacock butterflies, Inachis io, shown to effectively thwart attacks from blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Here, we test whether large eyespots on lepidopterans are generally effective in preventing attacks from small passerines and whether the size of insect or bird can influence the outcome of interactions. We staged experiments between the larger eyed hawkmoths, Smerinthus ocellatus, and the smaller peacock butterflies, I. io, and the larger great tits, Parus major, and the smaller blue tits, P. caeruleus. Survival differed substantially between the insect species with 21 of 24 peacock butterflies, but only 6 of 27 eyed hawkmoths, surviving attacks from the birds. Thus, surprisingly, the smaller prey survived to a higher extent, suggesting that factors other than insect size may be important. However, great tits were less easily intimidated by the insects' eyespots and deimatic behaviour and consumed 16 of 26, but the blue tits only 8 of 25, of the butterflies and hawkmoths. Our results demonstrate that eyespots per se do not guarantee survival and that these two insects bearing equally large eyespots are not equally well protected against predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Organisms are inherently modular, yet modules also evolve in response to selection for functional integration or functional specialization of traits. For serially repeated homologous traits, there is a clear expectation that selection on the function of individual traits will reduce the integration between traits and subdivide a single ancestral module. The eyespots on butterfly wings are one example of serially repeated morphological traits that share a common developmental mechanism but are subject to natural and sexual selection for divergent functions. Here, I test two hypotheses about the organization of the eyespot pattern into independent dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior modules, using a graphical modeling technique to examine patterns of eyespot covariation among and within wing surfaces in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Although there is a hierarchical and complex pattern of integration among eyespots, the results show a surprising mismatch between patterns of eyespot integration and the developmental and evolutionary eyespot units identified in previous empirical studies. These results are discussed in light of the relationships between developmental, functional, and evolutionary modules, and they suggest that developmental sources of independent trait variation are often masked by developmental sources of trait integration. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) plays an important role in vascular remodeling. This study was designed to determine whether uPA deficiency (KO) affects carotid artery ligation-induced vessel remodeling and the interaction with angiotensin II (Ang II). Ligation of the left common carotid artery in 6-month-old wild-type (C57 black/6J) mice for 4 weeks induced a concentric remodeling with vessel wall thickening, characterized by cell proliferation in neointima, media, and adventitia, and with lumen narrowing without a significant enlargement of overall vessel dimension. Intima lesions were characterized by α-actin positive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in a matrix background. No detectable presence of MAC-3 positive macrophages existed in the vascular wall. The ligation-induced vascular neointimal formation and adventitial proliferation, but not lumen narrowing and media expansion, were completely prevented in age-matched uPA-KO mice. Chronic infusion of Ang II (1.44 mg/kg per day) via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump did not significantly affect the gross morphology of the nonligated carotid artery from both wild-type and uPA-KO mice, but it enhanced ligation-induced vascular remodeling. However, in the presence of Ang II, uPA deficiency had no effects on ligation-induced mophermetric change, but it partially and significantly reduced cell proliferation. These data indicate that uPA may play a critical role in ligation-induced vessel remodeling. Ang II may activate other mechanisms independent of uPA to exacerbate ligation-induced vascular remodeling. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plasma-sprayed Al2O3 interlayer which was prefabricated can prevent oxygen penetration through the interconnected porosity in the topcoat, so that the thermally grown oxidation (TGO) growth and the failure can be suppressed, however, the prefabricated Al2O3 interlayer will result in interfacial stress redistribution. A four-concentric-sphere geometrical model, made up of topcoat, interlayer, TGO, and bondcoat, was developed based on three-dimensional shape of thermal barrier coatings. And the behavior of relevant interfacial residual stress depending on Al2O3 interlayer thickness for models of concave and convex morphology respectively was studied. The results show that the thickness of Al2O3 interlayer has a great effect on the interfacial residual stress distribution of thermal barrier coatings.

AB  - Behavioural stresses such as crowding are thought to incur a metabolic cost to insect larvae, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been shown to be a possible indicator of this stress. A study of a Madeiran population of the butterfly Pararge aegeria L. (Lepidoptera: Satyrinae) shows that larval crowding affects larval development and growth, with female larvae being more adversely affected than males. It was predicted that if larval crowding increases FA, male and female P. aegeria adults may show different responses to this stress. The FA of five different wing pattern elements on the dorsal hindwings of adult male and female P. aegeria that had been reared at different larval densities was measured. Crowding in P. aegeria resulted in a trait-specific and sex-specific increase in FA. Although a significant correlation between FA and longevity was not observed, there was a significant correlation with egg-laying rate. Stressed females increased their egg-laying rate. An increased egg-laying rate may carry a further fitness cost through the offspring of stressed females, because high egg-laying rates are associated with a decline in oviposition site quality. © 2006 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

AB  - Extrusion dies with up to nine concentric spiral mandrel manifolds have been developed for multilayer products and for pipe dies as this deign principle offers unique advantages. Layout and design are supported by computer simulations, which are similar to the conventional spiral mandrel systems. Computer-aided design tries to optimize uniform volume flow and low pressure drop with shear velocities, ensuring short material and color change times and, on the other hand, avoiding excessive heat generation and/or excessive pressure buildup. The system, besides compact size and economy in manufacturing, offers several advantages, including short flow passages and small melt volume, low shear rate at walls, and low pressure drop. Other advantages also include great flexibility regarding layered structure, thermal insulation and individual temperature control for each block, special design of individual modules, and ease of handling for cleaning and assembling.

AB  - Foraging habitat selection of nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) was investigated within an estuary with extensive impounded salt marsh habitat. Using a geographic information system, available habitat was partitioned into concentric bands at five, ten, and 15 km radius from nesting colonies to assess the relative effects of habitat composition and distance on habitat selection. Snowy Egrets were more likely than Great Egrets to depart colonies and travel to foraging sites in groups, but both species usually arrived at sites that were occupied by other wading birds. Mean flight distances were 6.2 km (SE = 0.4, N = 28, range 1.8-10.7 km) for Great Egrets and 4.7 km (SE = 0.48, N = 31, range 0.7-12.5 km) for Snowy Egrets. At the broadest spatial scale both species used impounded (mostly salt marsh) and estuarine edge habitat more than expected based on availability while avoiding unimpounded (mostly fresh water wetland) habitat. At more local scales habitat use matched availability. Interpretation of habitat preference differed with the types of habitat that were included and the maximum distance that habitat was considered available. These results illustrate that caution is needed when interpreting the results of habitat preference studies when individuals are constrained in their choice of habitats, such as for central place foragers.

AB  - In order to avoid the formation of normal cracks in the external layer of multilayered ceramic coatings during cooling, determination of the residual thermal stress field is essential. Concerning the effect of the intermediate layers (transition zone) on a possible reduction of stress in the external layer, it has been shown that in the case of a symmetrical (or constrained in-plane strain) system, reduction only occurs over a critical substrate thickness. In order to investigate the effect of the substrate geometry, the residual thermal stress field has also been determined in other configurations such as an asymmetrical arrangement (one side coating) allowing bending and a concentric-cylinder structure. In these last two configurations, a strong stress reduction is obtained. For practical applications such as gas turbine ceramic components, these results may provide guidelines for an optimum design of the geometry of substrate and intermediate layers of multilayered ceramic coatings. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Object detection is a critical step of many image recognition systems. In this paper, we discussed the circular shape object detection problem in still color images. The proposed method has an important feature of integrating color image edge extraction result with a novel circle parameter determination algorithm efficiently. First, an accurate isotropic edge detector is introduced to extract color image edge and calculate precise gradient direction of each potential edge pixel, which assures the high accuracy of subsequent circle detection. Then the detected potential edge results are verified by integrating them with spatial information and the result of region based analysis. Second we utilize just only one 2-dimensional accumulator array and one 1-dimensional accumulator array, which greatly reduce storage requirement and time complexity, to detect circles of any radius. Furthermore, the validity of detected potential circle centers is checked to avoid detecting false circles. Experimental results show that our method is robust and effective in locating objects with complete or incomplete or concentric circle boundary in real color images without any prior knowledge. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The ability of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to penetrate and grow within punctures, fresh-cut surfaces, and calyces of Golden Delicious apples was investigated. A three-strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7 resistant to ampicillin was used to inoculate fresh and 48-h-old punctures, fresh-cut surfaces, and open or closed calyces. A concentric cutting procedure was used to evaluate depth of penetration within punctures and prevent cross contamination during sampling. Within 2 h, E. coli O157: H7 penetrated vertically through the fresh punctures and 3.4 mm within the underlying parenchyma. After 48 h, E. coli O157: H7 cells penetrated up to 5.5 mm within the punctures and >2.6 mm horizontally away from fresh punctures. However, 48-h-old punctures did not permit penetration beyond their boundaries. Fresh-cut surfaces permitted up to 2.8 mm penetration after 24 h. Onset of growth of E. coli O157:H7 occurred 4 to 8 h postinoculation on fresh punctures and fresh-cut surfaces with populations increasing by 3 logs after 48 h. E. coli O157:H7 penetrated within calyces regardless of the extent of opening or method of inoculation. However, E. coli O157:H7 was never recovered from the inner core of apples. Computed tomography scan imaging revealed that closed calyces effectively prevented penetration of sodium iodide solutions within the calyx cavity. Lack of solution penetration may explain why sanitizing treatments are ineffective in inactivating microbial cells within the calyx. Understanding the role of morphological differences in permitting or restricting bacterial penetration may lead to development of more effective strategies to enhance the safety of fresh horticultural products.

AB  - A general closed-form analytical solution is derived for the lapping tracks with its kinematics for the concentric V-groove lapping system. Based on the kinematics, the theoretical prediction in the prediction of the ball-spin angle β is in very good agreement with the experimental results from the observation of the contact track, where a small slip ratio occurs at the contact points. The lapping tracks on the ball surface for the three contact points are fixed circles, and their lengths of the lapping tracks are linearly proportional to |sin(θ1+β)|, |sin(θ2+β)|, and |cos β|, respectively. To understand the generation mechanism of spherical surface, the ball is enforced to rotate a certain degree of δ with respect to its previous orientation when it enters the lap again. Results show that the lapped area ratio, Lr, is significantly influenced by the angular speed ratio, wb/Ωb, and δ. When the angular speed ratio is integer and δ is small enough or randomized, the lapped area ratios at the contact points of A, B, and C are linearly proportional to [sin θ+sin(θ+2β)], [sin θ+sin(θ-2β)], and (1+cos 2β), respectively. In practice, if the orientation is randomized as the ball enters the lap again, then the distribution of the lapping tracks are dense after many cycles, and the larger the lapping length in each cycle, the smaller is the number of cycles required to achieve the maximum lapped area ratio. In the geometry design of ball lapping, the V-groove half-angle should be larger than 45°, but to prevent the splash of abrasives, it should be less than 75°. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Eyespots are found in a variety of animals, in particular lepidopterans. The role of eyespots as antipredator mechanisms has been discussed since the 19th Century, with two main hypotheses invoked to explain their occurrence. The first is that large, centrally located eyespots intimidate predators by resembling the eyes of the predators' own enemies; the second, though not necessarily conflicting, hypothesis is that small, peripherally located eyespots function as markers to deflect the attacks of predators to non-vital regions of the body. A third possibility is also proposed; that eyespots intimidate predators merely because they are novel or rarely encountered salient features. These hypotheses are reviewed, with special reference given to avian predators, since these are likely to be the principal visually hunting predators of the lepidopterans considered. Also highlighted is the necessity to consider the potential influence of sexual selection on lepidopteran wing patterns, and the genetics and development of eyespot formation. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - The design of brace connections for concentrically braced steel frames detailed for ductile inelastic seismic response is examined. The study focuses on bracing members made of square hollow structural steel shapes with welded slotted connections. Different design strategies are investigated to prevent net section fracture and develop the full tensile capacity of the braces. Connections designs for out-of-plane and in-plane buckling of the braces are also proposed and discussed. The response of a brace sample subjected to monotonic loading as well as under quasi-static cyclic displacement history is examined through detailed finite element analysis. Un-reinforced brace connections are found to be prone to premature fracture under tension, especially when defects are present along the slots cut in the tube walls. Connections designed for out-of-plane and in-plane brace buckling resulted in nearly identical cyclic inelastic brace response. For the out-of-plane buckling design, satisfactory brace end rotation response was achieved without the free length gusset plate detail proposed in codes.

AB  - Sabre Defense Industries of UK has adopted the HTB-2000, developed by Sunnen Products Co., St. Louis, to produce .50-caliber barrel for the M2 Browning machine gun and M3 aircraft machine gun. The HTB-2000 uses Borazon CBN stones, a traveling steady rest, and whip-guide bushings. Whip-guide bushings support the long hone tool and prevent it from whipping around as it enters a barrel. An automatic-gaging system checks the bore after every stroke, giving operators hands-off control of hole size, roundness, and straightness to∓ 0.0005 in. It also offsets small variations introduced by later button-rifling and chrome-plating operations. A load-sensing system in the HTB-2000 eliminates costly tool crashes by automatically adjusting stone feed for optimum stock removal. The round hole prevents high and low spots in the rifling and keeps the grooves concentric with the bore, which helps to improve accuracy.

AB  - Coronary artery vasculopathy (CAV), characterized by diffuse concentric coronary artery intimal thickening with fibrosis, remains a significant complication impeding long term engraftment in heart transplantation. The pathophysiologic processes driving CAV are not well understood, however T cell mediated cellular immunity and cytokines have been implicated. The inability to prevent CAV may be related in part to a limited spectrum of inhibition that that current immunosuppressive therapies exhibit against second messenger pathways elicited by T cell receptor (TCR) activation and dose limiting toxicities. Therefore, considering that antigen specific T cell activation is initiated at the TCR, including alloresponses involving direct and indirect antigen presentation, targeting the proximal kinases involved in this process may provide novel therapeutic options for controlling rejection. Src family kinases (SFK), particularly p56lck (Lck) and p59fyn (Fyn), are intimately associated with the earliest signaling events through the TCR and could provide targets for immunomodulatory agents. Such targeted inhibition of TCR signaling may institute a novel approach for diminishing the T cell mediated response associated with CAV. In this review we discuss therapeutic agents that have been shown to inhibit SFK and the rationale for investigating the potential application of these agents in heart transplantation. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - For bracings in braced steel frames, Hollow Structural Sections (HSS) represent an ideal solution due to their excellent structural properties in compression. Nevertheless, their use has been compromised for seismic applications mainly due to a lack of simplified connection details that avoid brittle failures. At present, slotted HSS connections are popular in seismic zones but the hollow section is typically reinforced with steel cover plates to increase the net area at the critical location to avoid premature fracture under tension loading cycles. Using finite element analysis, it is shown that this reinforcing practice can be avoided, for Circular Hollow Sections (CHS), if both the tube and the plate are slotted such that the weld terminates at the tube gross cross-section. The validity of this innovative detail is demonstrated by means of three large-scale specimen tests under pseudo-dynamic concentric loading.

AB  - Stromatoporoids grew on both soft and hard substrates, and recent work revealed primary cavities in Devonian reef systems. We present evidence that stromatoporoids also developed primary cavities in muddy sediments. Stromatoporoids initiated on two categories of material: (1) fine-grained sediment, usually covering large bioclasts; (2) uncovered bioclasts, forming a small area of clean substrate. In both, subsequent growth was previously usually interpreted to be across, and in direct contact with, adjacent fine-grained sediment, itself presumed to be unlithified in most cases. However, stromatoporoid basal surfaces show two types of morphology: (A) smooth, generally curved and flat, and (B) corrugated, with concentric growth rings as minor ridges projecting downwards. Both may be present in different stromatoporoid individuals of the same species. Smooth bases are interpreted in most cases to indicate growth on unlithified sediment, and are common in category 1 above. For corrugated bases, rings are interpreted to result from growth to form minor primary cavities by the stromatoporoid skeleton growing laterally a few mm above the substrate. The base then likely settled into the soft sediment as skeletal mass increased. Primary cavities are interpreted to be similar to those in muddy Devonian facies, but both differ from those in Devonian reefs (e.g. Canning Basin) where cavities may be tens of cm high, and were permanent. In the Silurian samples, a third morphology of concentric basal ring arrangement containing sediment wedges is interpreted as due to episodic sedimentation. Also, stromatoporoids grew on lithified and eroded intraclasts, indicating patchy early lithification of the sea floor in these open shelf settings. Evidence presented from the Silurian examples emphasises the dynamic response of stromatoporoids to their substrate, consistent with sediment-avoiding habits of modern calcified sponges. © 2006 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association).

AB  - Recent researches point to the great potential of the sandwich pipe conception for ultra deepwater exploitation and production of oil and natural gas. Its configuration is very simple and comprises two concentric metallic pipes with a core material, polymeric or ceramic, in the annulus. The main functions of the annular layer are: to provide satisfactory thermal insulation so as to avoid the formation of wax and hydrates along the pipeline during production shutdown; to improve the overall structural strength of the system. Polypropylene and cement have been recently proposed for these applications. The reason for the choice of these materials was the low cost and the extensive availability in industry. Here a systematic material selection approach is employed in order to assess the applicability of other polymeric materials. The attributes of materials needed to meet the design specification are thoroughly studied. The list of possible materials was enlarged and the modified digital logic approach is used with the purpose to define a top group of materials for further numerical comparative study. Finite element analyses are carried out to assess the structural strength of the sandwich pipe under pure external pressure or longitudinal bending and combined external pressure and bending. Additionally, the effect of thermal gradient is included to the numerical analyses to evaluate each pre-selected material of the top group. Results indicate that other potential materials such as PEEK and polycarbonate can improve the structural performance of the sandwich pipe conception and yet meet other several design criteria.

AB  - Several species of raptors have two ocelli (eye-like patches) in the back of their head, giving them the appearance of a false face, although this trait has rarely been reported. According to our observations, these markings may be widespread in the family Falconidae, some Accipiter hawks, and some owls (e.g. Glaucidium, and some Athene, Aegolius, and Surnia). In this study, we outline general classes of hypotheses that may account for ocelli on the heads of raptors. The most frequently evoked general hypothesis is that ocelli offer protection against attackers. For example, a predator may abort the effort, be deflected by the ocelli, or be warned that the bearer will retaliate if attacked. We propose two alternatives. Most raptors with ocelli typically include a large proportion of passerine birds in their diets. The false faces may have evolved to aid in the hunting of small birds by actually provoking, or manipulating the nature of, a mobbing response. The benefit of doing so may either be immediate because there are numerous accounts of mobbers being killed, or the benefit may be postponed if the predator is using mobbing as a means of evaluating hunting prospects in a given area. An analysis of the pygmy-owls of the genus Glaucidium indicates that species displaying ocelli in the nape tend to have a high proportion of small birds in their diets and live in open habitats, whereas the opposite is true for species without ocelli. Pygmy-owls with ocelli are also considerably smaller and, collectively, these findings are most consistent with false faces being a conspicuous visual signal to deceive mobbing birds so they can be preyed upon. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Coralloid-shaped speleothems samples were collected from a small cave in a mountain of the Roraima massif, Brazil. They were mineralogically identified as opal-A and show two concentric growth zones: A massive light colored inner one, and a darker outer zone with a spongy texture. On the surface the presence of some filaments probably of algae suggest biomineralisation. Chemically the outer zone shows impurities with high values of Cl and P. The leaching of bird nest guano may be the source of P. The two zones were probably formed in two different climatic conditions, the outer one in the current wet and vegetated period, and the inner zone during a former drier period.

AB  - Phenomenal transparency is commonly studied by using a stimulus configuration introduced by Metelli: a bipartite patch, divided into equal left and right halves is overlaid with a smaller, concentric bipartite patch, divided along the same line. Observers are instructed to report either a transparent patch over an opaque bipartite field or a mosaic of four opaque patches. We show theoretically and empirically that these are only two of five generic perceptual categories, namely, transparent patch, transparent annulus (hole), mosaic, partial transparency, and multiple transparency (ambiguous) cases. Thus Gestalt factors complicate the interpretation "phenomenal transparency." We propose a framework that avoids this complication. There is excellent agreement between predictions and results. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Age-related decline in maximal concentric muscle power is associated with frailty and functional impairments in the elderly. Compared to concentric contraction, mechanical muscle output is generally enhanced when muscles are rapidly pre-stretched (eccentric contraction), albeit less pronounced with increasing age. Exercise has been recommended to prevent loss of muscle power and function and recent guidelines indicate training program for increasing muscle power highly relevant for elderly subjects. This study examined the differences in muscle power, force and movement pattern during concentric-alone and coupled eccentric-concentric contraction and selected functional motor performances before and after 36-week multicomponent training including aerobic, strength, balance, flexibility and coordination components in elderly males. Vertical force, excursion, velocity, power and acceleration of the body center of mass were measured in two standardised vertical jumps (squatting jump, SQJ; countermovement jump, CMJ). Pre-stretch enhancement during CMJ did not improve performance [i.e., no enhanced maximal muscle power (Ppeak) and jump height (JH)] compared to concentric-alone muscle contraction (SQJ). Nevertheless, pre-stretch enhancement occurred as for similar SQJ and CMJ maximal performance, elderly people employed lower mechanical work, higher mean muscle power (Pmean), shorter concentric phase duration and shorter body center of mass displacement during CMJ. Post training, CMJ Ppeak, Pmean and JH increased in training group (P < 0.05) while Ppeak and JH decreased in control group during the CMJ and SQJ (P < 0.05). In conclusion, long-term training counteracted the age-related decline in muscle power and functional performance observed in the control subjects, while substantial gains in muscular performance were observed in the trained elderly. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to apply image processing technology and neural network to the defective detection of array panel. Firstly, two-dimensional Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform are utilized and then let defects be even conspicuous by the use of binary image segmentation technology. By the help of pixel labeling, defective breach detection and dilation and some other processing techniques have the defective spots return to the original condition. According to the image characteristics, we identify six graphic features: Area, perimeter, roundness, length and width of the least rectangle covering whole spot, four-directional areas of defective spot and four-directional areas of defective spot after thinning, serving as feature values of that defective spot. All the six image characteristics are served as the characteristic values for that defected spot detection. In conclusion, the features values can be employed as input training and testing data for neural network paradigms. The recognition process can then conducted by the application of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network, ant-based SOM, BPN and supervised SOM for three common metal residue defects, i.e. round metal residue, concentric residue, irregular residue and scrape. Samples without defects are also added to do recognition. Experimental findings clearly show that these four neural network paradigms are capable of recognizing five kinds of defects in the array panel. The recognition correctness rate can achieve 100%. We may apply this research result to the online recognition system for defective detections of the array panel to reduce human detection errors.

AB  - Introduction: We report an in vitro study comparing the effectiveness of clot removal and clot fragmentation of five embolectomy systems. Methods: A flow model was embolized with fresh and old thrombi, occluding an inner diameter of 2-5 mm simulating internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) branch occlusion. Embolectomy was performed using five retrieval systems: CATCH (Balt), Merci retriever (Concentric), InTime and Attracter (Boston Scientific), and the Phenox Clot Retriever (Phenox). Clot removal and evidence and type of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization were recorded. Results: There were no observable differences attributable to thrombus age. The Merci, CATCH and Phenox Clot Retriever were equally able to mobilize and remove thrombi with the exception of one particularly firm clot. There were marked differences in terms of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization. All devices produced micro- and macrofragments during penetration and retrieval. The Phenox Clot Retriever was able to filter fragments. The InTime and Attracter devices failed to retrieve thrombi in this model and achieved partial removal at best with a tendency towards thrombus displacement and fragmentation. Conclusion: Within limits, the experimental setup was appropriate for generating occlusions of diameter 2-5 mm of various lengths, simulating ICA, BA and MCA thromboembolism. In this model, thrombus mobilization appeared to be less dependent upon the individual design of the retrieval system than on thrombus fragmentation. The ability to prevent distal embolization is, however, strongly dependent on the ability of a thrombectomy device to capture fragments that are generated during removal of the device. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Although several studies have investigated the acute effect of static stretching exercises, the duration of exercises that negatively affects performance has not been ascertained. This study was conducted to determine the acute effect of different static stretching durations on quadriceps isometric and isokinetic peak torque production. The 50 participants were randomly allocated into five equivalent sized groups and were asked to perform a stretching exercise of different duration (no stretch, 10-second stretch, 20-second stretch, 30-second stretch, and 60-second stretch). The knee flexion range of motion and the isometric and concentric isokinetic peak torques of the quadriceps were measured before and after a static stretching exercise in the four experimental groups. The same parameters were examined in the control group (no stretch) without stretching, before and after a 5-minute passive rest. There were no significant differences among groups before the experimentation regarding their physical characteristics and performances (P > 0.05). These results reflect the different groups' homogeneity. Significant knee joint flexibility increases (P < 0.001) and significant isometric and isokinetic peak torque reductions (P < 0.05-0.001) have been shown to occur only after 30 and 60 seconds of quadriceps static stretching. Stretching reduced isometric peak torque by 8.5% and 16.0%, respectively. Concerning isokinetic peak torque after 30 and 60 seconds of stretching, it was reduced by 5.5% vs. 11.6% at 60°/s and by 5.8% vs. 10.0% at 180°/s. We suggest that torque decrements are related to changes of muscle neuromechanical properties. It is recommended that static stretching exercises of a muscle group for more than 30 seconds of duration be avoided before performances requiring maximal strength. © 2008, National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - Submarine lavas recovered from the Hilina bench region, offshore Kilauea, Hawaii Island provide information on ancient Kilauea volcano and the geochemical components of the Hawaiian hotspot. Alkalic lavas, including nephelinite, basanite, hawaiite, and alkali basalt, dominate the earliest stage of Kilauea magmatism. Transitional basalt pillow lavas are an intermediate phase, preceding development of the voluminous tholeiitic subaerial shield and submarine Puna Ridge. Most alkalic through transitional lavas are quite uniform in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, supporting the interpretation that variable extent partial melting of a relatively homogeneous source was responsible for much of the geochemical diversity of early Kilauea magmas (Sisson et al., 2002). These samples are among the highest 206Pb/204Pb known from Hawaii and may represent melts from a distinct geochemical and isotopic end-member involved in the generation of most Hawaiian tholeiites. This end-member is similar to the postulated literature Kea component, but we propose that it should be renamed Hilina, to avoid confusion with the geographically defined Kea-trend volcanoes. Isotopic compositions of some shield-stage Kilauea tholeiites overlap the Hilina end-member but most deviate far into the interior of the isotopic field defined by magmas from other Hawaiian volcanoes, reflecting the introduction of melt contributions from both "Koolau" (high 87Sr/86Sr, low 206Pb/204Pb) and depleted (low 87Sr/86Sr, intermediate 206Pb/204Pb) source materials. This shift in isotopic character from nearly uniform, end-member, and alkalic, to diverse and tholeiitic corresponds with the major increase in Kilauea's magmatic productivity. Two popular geodynamic models can account for these relations: (1) The upwelling mantle source could be concentrically zoned in both chemical/isotopic composition, and in speed/extent of upwelling, with Hilina (and Loihi) components situated in the weakly ascending margins and the Koolau component in the interior. The depleted component could be refractory and spread throughout or scavenged from the overlying lithosphere. (2) The Hilina (and Loihi) components could be a more fertile material (lower melting temperature) spread irregularly throughout the Hawaiian source in a matrix of more refractory depleted and Koolau compositions. Modest upwelling along the leading hotspot margin melts the fertile domains predominantly, while the refractory matrix also partially melts in the more vigorously upwelling hotspot interior, diluting the Hilina and Loihi components and yielding voluminous isotopically diverse tholeiitic magmas. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper analyses the carrying capacity of edge-cracked columns with different boundary conditions and cross sections subjected to concentric vertical loads. The transfer matrix method, combined with fundamental solutions of the intact columns (e.g. columns with no cracks) is used to obtain the capacity of slender prismatic columns. The stiffness of the cracked section is modeled by a massless rotational spring whose flexibility depends on the local flexibility induced by the crack. Eigenvalue equations are obtained explicitly for columns with various end conditions, from second-order determinants. Numerical examples show that the effects of a crack on the buckling load of a column depend strongly on the depth and the location of the crack. In other words, the capacity of the column strongly depends on the flexibility due to the crack. As expected, the buckling load decreases conspicuously as the flexibility of the column increases. However, the flexibility is a very important factor for controlling the buckling load capacity of a cracked column. In this study an attempt was made to calculate the column flexibility based on two different approaches, finite element and J-Integral approaches. It was found that there was very good agreement between the flexibility results obtained by these two different methods (maximum discrepancy less than 2%). It was found that for constant column flexibility a crack located in the section of the maximum bending moment causes the largest decrease in the buckling load. On the other hand, if the crack is located just in the inflexion point at the corresponding intact column, it has no effect on the buckling load capacity. This study showed that the transfer matrix method could be a simple and efficient method to analyze cracked columns components. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Enigmatic discoidal fossils are common in Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences and in the stratigraphic record pre-date the first appearance of diverse Ediacaran fossil assemblages. Termed 'medusoids', these Neoproterozoic discoidal fossils have generally been interpreted as coelenterate-grade organisms implying a radially symmetrical body plan for ancestral eumetazoans. Analysis of exceptionally preserved discoidal fossils from the White Sea area, however, indicates that most of these discoidal forms represent colonial microbes. Localized pyritization, for example, reveals the presence of a conspicuous filamentous substructure in Ediacaria, whereas concentric rings, radial sectors and central structures in Cyclomedusa and Paliella compare directly with Recent microbial colonies growing in a nutritionally heterogeneous environment. At least some Ediacaran discoids can be compared with extant concentric ring-shaped microbial colonies that grow in hypersaline microbial mats. Insofar as most of the remaining record of Ediacaran discoids can be attributed to the holdfast structures of non-radiate modular organisms, there is no support from the fossil record for identifying a radiate ancestry for the Metazoa. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation © 2007 The Lethaia Foundation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION As a historiographer of the Americas, I have sought to illuminate the facts through the employment of comparisons and statistical surveys and, thus, provide proof to my ideas. With these words, Alexander von Humboldt began the chapter on slavery in his Political Essay (Essai politique) on the island of Cuba, published in 1826. The chapter represented the most important argument made by a liberal thinker against slavery in the Atlantic world in the first half of the nineteenth century. Understandably, when John Thrasher omitted it from his 1856 translation of the Essai politique into English, Humboldt protested openly and forcefully against the omission. The origins of systematic comparison between slave systems, however, can be traced back to earlier than the publication of Humboldt's Essai politique and can be linked directly to the Haitian revolution. Already by 21 August 1791, immediately after the outbreak of the rebellion in the Acul region's plantations, in the north of Saint Domingue, terror struck throughout the world of slaveholders in the Americas. A powerful fear travelled through the Atlantic world in a pattern of concentric rings; one could appropriately describe this phenomenon by saying that ‘a spectre wandered through the Americas’. It was, thus, the ‘suspicion of an analogy between the contemporaneous shocks experienced by all the American slave systems’ that was to trigger scientific comparison. © Cambridge University Press 2008.

AB  - Fire statistics and investigations from Taiwan and other countries were studied to determine the fire characteristics of warehouse type buildings. Twelve real domestic cases were chosen for detailed examination to determine the common fire safety problems of warehouses in Taiwan. Further, by referring to the most-used international fire safety assessments and conclusions from symposiums, a local fire safety assessment system consisting of five circle-concentric layers was constructed. The content of each layer and the relation between them are detailed in this article. In addition, the weighted values of each fire safety assessment attribute were acquired through the questionnaires sent out to the domain experts. It is expected that these statistics and weighted values will be used to indicate the risk level of warehouse fires, and to encourage building owners to use extra diligence in fire prevention and fire safety management. As a result, the most pervasive fire safety issues affecting warehouses can be resolved. © 2009, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

AB  - National Forest Inventories (NFI) are a basic tool for forestry planning at the National level. A new two-step system for predicting ingrowth compatible with NFI data is presented in order to improve long-term estimation of stand condition. In growth and yield models, an ingrowth submodel is a key feature for long-term estimation. An accurate projection of ingrowth is needed to avoid model projection bias and inaccuracy. A two-step approach was used, which consisted of (I) estimating the probability of ingrowth occurrence on a sample plot and (II) quantifying the ingrowth in terms of basal area. Logistic regression was used for step I, while linear regression was used for step II. A good performance of the joint ingrowth model for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Mediterranean Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait. Ssp mesogeensis) stands was observed. Logistic model include quadratic mean diameter as independent variables for both species while basal area is only included for Mediterranean Maritime. Quadratic mean diameter is the only independent variable in linear model for both species. The presented two-step modeling methodology for ingrowth is applicable to data from National Forest Inventories with concentric plots.

AB  - We present the development and demonstration of a novel technique for microscopic analysis of urine particles. Casts and crystals in urine are indicative of clinically important abnormalities. Current urinalysis techniques using flow cytometry and image analysis are limited by their inability to detect, identify and classify crystals and casts. Casts, crystals and yeast cells reported by current automated urine particle analyzers must be confirmed by a second microscopic review involving a human operator to prevent false positives. Human examination of suspect urine samples is resource intensive and time consuming. We introduce a new imaging method to add functionality for recognition of casts and crystals in urine. Our approach uses a polarization microscopy technique to aid classification of crystals, casts and other urine particles. Crystals and casts in urine exhibit unique interference patterns when imaged using a fixed polarizer and analyzer in a crossed configuration. These interference patterns are a measure of birefringence (retardation angle) of the cast or crystal being imaged. Preliminary experiments indicate that uric acid shows a polarization color, and larger crystals exhibit a series of concentric black lines. We show that these unique 'signatures' when used in conjunction with a hierarchical pattern recognition technique can reliably classify the analytes with improved accuracy. The new imaging technique combined with the classification algorithm can address the shortcomings of current urinalysis techniques; and provide quicker and more accurate results.

AB  - A fundamental issue of collective intelligence is whether the collective pattern or process is based on environmental information that explicitly codes for it or arises through self-organization of the individuals. Sometimes, these alternatives occur together. Adaptive systems may also be capable of utilizing different types of mechanism under different conditions. Sendova-Franks et al. (Anim Behav 68:1095-1106, 2004) demonstrated evidence for a self-organization mechanism of brood sorting in the ant Temnothorax albipennis, where the brood are sorted in a series of bands or concentric annuli that increase in size with distance from the colony centre. The work by Cox and Blanchard (J Theor Biol 204:223-238, 2000) suggests an alternative or complementary mechanism whereby the brood pattern is specified by the template of a CO2 gradient. Here, we test for a gaseous template as a necessary condition for brood sorting. Under the experimental condition, we pumped the air out of the nest continuously to prevent the accumulation of any gaseous substances. We compared the brood pattern between the experimental and control conditions according to four characteristics: mean distance from centre, mean nearest-neighbour distance, shape and area. Under the experimental condition, the order of brood types according to the first two characteristics was the same as in the control. The area of the brood pattern was smaller, and its shape elongated under the experimental condition. As expected on the basis of these differences, mean distance from centre was greater and mean nearest-neighbour distance was smaller under the experimental condition (although not statistically significantly) and by the expected amount. We found evidence that ants avoid placing brood in the strongest airflow stream. This could explain the reduced area and elongated shape of the brood pattern under the experimental condition. We conclude that a gaseous template is not a necessary condition for brood sorting. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - Frictional drag reduction due to the presence of small bubbles is investigated experimentally using a Couette-Taylor flow system; i.e., shear flow between concentric cylinders. Torque and bubble behavior are measured as a function of Reynolds number up to Re=5000 while air bubbles are injected constantly and rise through an array of vortical cells. Silicone oil is used to avoid the uncertain interfacial property of bubbles and to produce nearly monosized bubble distributions. The effect of drag reduction on sensitivity and power gain are assessed. The sensitivity exceeds unity at Re<2000, proving that the effect of the reduction in drag is greater than that of the reduction in mixture density. This is due to the accumulation of bubbles toward the rotating inner cylinder, which is little affected by turbulence. The power gain, which is defined by the power saving from the drag reduction per the pumping power of bubble injection, has a maximum value of O(10) at higher Re numbers around 2500. An image processing measurement shows this is because of the disappearance of azimuthal waves when the organized bubble distribution transforms from toroidal to spiral modes. Moreover, the axial spacing of bubble clouds expands during the transition, which results in an effective reduction in the momentum exchange. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - We investigated both the phenotypic and developmental integration of eyespots on the fore- and hindwings of speckled wood butterflies Pararge aegeria. Eyespots develop within a framework of wing veins, which may not only separate eyespots developmentally, but may at the same time also integrate them by virtue of being both signalling sources and barriers during eyespot development. We therefore specifically investigated the interaction between wing venation patterns and eyespot integration. Phenotypic covariation among eyespots was very high, but only eyespots in neighbouring wing cells and in homologous wing cells on different wing surfaces were developmentally integrated. This can be explained by the fact that the wing cells of these eyespots share one or more wing veins. The wing venation patterns of fore- and hindwings were highly integrated, both phenotypically and developmentally. This did not affect overall developmental integration of the eyespots. The adaptive significance of integration patterns is discussed and more specifically we stress the need to conduct studies on phenotypic plasticity of integration. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We have developed a tubular type fuel assembly design as one of candidates for fuel to be used in the Advanced HANARO Reactor (AHR). The tubular type fuel has several merits over a rod type fuel with respect to the thermal-hydraulic and structural safety; the larger ratio of surface area to volume makes the surface temperature of a fuel element become lower, and curved plate is stronger against longitudinal bending and vibration. In the other side, a disadvantage is expected such that the flow velocity can be distributed unevenly channel by channel because the flow channels are isolated from each other in a tubular type fuel assembly. In addition to the design development, we also investigated the flow characteristics of the tubular fuel experimentally. To examine the flow velocity distribution and pressure drop, we made an experiment facility and a mockup of the tubular fuel assembly. The fuel assembly consists of 6 concentric fuel tubes so that 7 layers are made between fuel tubes. Since each layer is divided into three sections by stiffeners, 21 isolated flow channels are made in total. We employed pilot-tubes to measure the coolant velocity in each channel. The maximum velocity was measured as large as about 28% of the average velocity. It was observed in the innermost channel contrarily to the expectation from the hydraulic diameter. A change in the total flow rate did not affect the flow distribution. Meanwhile, the pressure drop was measured as about 70% of the drop in the rod type fuel assembly in use in HANARO.

AB  - A mechanistic understanding of the butterfly wing color-pattern determination can be facilitated by experimental pattern changes. Here I review physiologically induced color-pattern changes in nymphalid butterflies and their mechanistic and evolutionary implications. A type of color-pattern change can be elicited by elemental changes in size and position throughout the wing, as suggested by the nymphalid groundplan. These changes of pattern elements are bi-directional and bi-sided dislocation toward or away from eyespot foci and in both proximal and distal sides of the foci. The peripheral elements are dislocated even in the eyespot-less compartments. Anterior spots are more severely modified, suggesting the existence of an anterior-posterior gradient. In one species, eyespots are transformed into white spots with remnant-like orange scales, and such patterns emerge even at the eyespot-less "imaginary" foci. A series of these color-pattern modifications probably reveal "snap-shots" of a dynamic morphogenic signal due to heterochronic uncoupling between the signaling and reception steps. The conventional gradient model can be revised to account for these observed color-pattern changes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle Dendroctonus micans is a major pest of spruce which is expanding its range in France, Turkey, England and Wales. Its monospecific predator Rhizophagus grandis has followed its prey naturally into most areas and since the 1960s has also been mass-produced and released within newly infested locations. Assessing bark-beetle presence at previously uninfested sites, or predator establishment after release or natural spread, currently depends on direct observation of D. micans brood chambers. This is a slow and unreliable process because bark-beetle attacks are solitary, cryptic and occur on living trees. An effective trapping method would thus be most useful. 2. A synthetic lure for R. grandis was first field-tested in release-recapture experiments. Release points were surrounded by one or two concentric rings of traps baited with either D. micans larval frass or with a blend of synthetic chemicals. Kairomone-trapping using the synthetic lure was then tested in the field, monitoring R. grandis in 58 spruce stands in Belgium and France. 3. In the release-recapture experiments, up to 65% of the released predators were caught within 48 h. Catches with the synthetic lure and with prey frass were not significantly different. 4. Field-trapping assays showed R. grandis establishment in 30 stands, including areas where the predator had been introduced artificially. Trapping was unsuccessful at the southern and western limits of D. micans' range. Combined visual and trapping approaches identified 32 stands containing the predators, with two false negatives with the trapping method, compared to 19 for the visual surveys. 5. Unexpectedly, male and female D. micans adults were trapped in some cases. The combined approach identified 43 attacked stands, among which there were four false negatives with the trapping method and 11 with the visual surveys. 6. Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of using kairomone traps to monitor a predator after releases for biocontrol. Furthermore, because this predator is strictly prey-specific, this technique also identifies stands colonized by D. micans bark beetles. Following inoculative predator releases, kairomone trapping could be used to survey for D. micans in areas under colonization or in European Union 'Protected Zones'. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Free-fall gas atomizers are often used for liquid solution and melt atomization in the area of powder production and spray forming applications. This external mixing atomizer often uses two separate gas nozzle systems, namely, a primary gas nozzle (for prevention of major gas recirculation flow in the atomization area) and a secondary gas nozzle (for atomization), both concentrically surrounding the central liquid jet. Due to this specific arrangement, the atomization area is separated from the atomizer body, however the primary and secondary gas pressures need to be carefully adjusted. To improve the free-fall atomizer construction and operating conditions, the gas flow field of a conventional free-fall atomizer was investigated by numerical simulations. Aim of the investigation was to economize the primary gas application, while safely operating the atomizer without recirculations. Advantages of the derived flow-adapted atomizer design are a reduction in gas consumption, as well as the potential of generation of smaller particles. This effect was proven by atomization of a viscous melt. Copyright © 2008 Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Urban sprawl is characterized by haphazard patchwork of development, which leads to an improper development in any city. To prevent this kind of sprawl in future, it is necessary to monitor the growth of the city. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present study to monitor the urban growth over a period of time by employing Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques in conjunction with Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a measure to determine the compactness or dispersion of built-up land growth in the urban areas. The growth patterns of urban built-up land have been studied initially by dividing the area into four zones. The observations have been made with respect to each zone. Then, the study area has been divided into concentric circles of 1 km buffers and the growth patterns have been studied based on urban built-up density with respect to each circular buffer in all four zones. These observations have been integrated with road network to check the influence of infrastructure on haphazard urban growth. It has been found from the study that Shannon entropy is a good measure to determine the spatial concentration or dispersion of built-up land in the city. The study also proved the potential of RS and GIS techniques in the spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth trends and their consequences in the lands adjoining to urban areas. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Judging by the volume of writings about evolutionary constraints, they are an important topic in evolutionary biology. However, their involvement in shaping patterns of evolutionary change from morphological stasis to adaptive radiation remains contentious. This is at least in part because of the paucity of robust analyses of potential examples of constraints, whether of a more absolute or a relative nature. Here, we argue that what is needed to explore the type of constraints and bias on evolutionary change that may emerge from the way in which phenotypic variation is generated is an integrative approach applied to systems that can be tackled at different levels of biological organization. This is illustrated using research on the evolution of patterns in butterfly wing eyespots that has applied a combination of evolutionary genetics and evo-devo to an emerging model species with the beginnings of a comparative approach to describe patterns of variability among the extant taxa of two species-rich genera. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - The encoder strip serves as the guide to tell where the carriage position is in a printer In the course of printing using an inkjet printer, aerosol will tend to spread around the printer and will contaminate the encoder strip of the carriage over time. This will lead to inaccurate movements causing print quality problems. Under serious situations, the carriage can stall as it is unable to locate itself correctly. One solution is to place brushes at the carriage where it is in contact with encoder strip. As the carriage travels along, the brushes will clean the encoder strip. However this may not eliminate the problem because the aerosol can start sticking to the encoder strip which makes it hard to remove. Another solution is to place an exhaust fan in the printer to suck out the aerosol. However this is an expensive design and takes up space and places additional load on the electrical components. By using the enclosed encoder disk, aerosol is unable to reach the surface of the encoder surface and therefore keeping it clean. Referring to Figure 1, across the printer in the X axis, a long fine mesh gear teeth platform is mounted on the surface of the chassis. On the carriage, a fine mesh gear matching the gear teeth platform is mounted on and is linked in concentricity to the encoder disk as shown in Figure 2. The encoder disk is enclosed leaving only the gear teeth exposing to outside environment. When the carriage moves left and right, the gear turns and in turn rotates the encoder disks. As the gear rotates a certain amount, it translates into a number of counts on the encoder disk, and this indicates how much the carriage has moved. Since the encoder disk remains in an enclosed environment, the amount of aerosol on it will be very minimal.

AB  - Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Objective: To evaluate isokinetic shoulder flexor-extensor (F/E) and abductor-adductor (Ab/Ad) torque ratios in individuals with paraplegia using a new interpretative approach. We proposed to study torque ratios according to joint angle sections (15° angle subgroups) over a selected range of motion. Setting: Pathokinesiology Laboratory, Montreal, Canada. Method: Sixteen individuals with complete motor paraplegia, without shoulder pain or impairment, were included in this study. After a preloading period of 1 s, maximum isokinetic concentric contractions of all muscle groups were completed at 30, 60 and 120° s-1 over the entire tested ranges of motion (70 to -35° for the flexion-extension and 15 to 60° for the abduction-adduction). After the continuous torque curves were rebuilt, the mean F/E and Ab/Ad torque ratios were calculated and analyzed every 15°. Results: A significant modification of the F/E (F=66.3; P<0.001) and Ab/Ad (F=100.6; P<0.001) torque ratios was observed according to the 15° angle subgroup evaluated. More precisely, a progressive decline of both the F/E and Ab/Ad ratios was noted as the shoulder flexion or abduction progressed. Angular velocity did not have any influence on torque ratio values. Conclusion: Angle subgroup torque ratio analysis leads to a better estimation of the balance between the agonist and antagonist muscle groups than does traditional peak torque ratio analysis. In individuals with paraplegia, this precise estimation of torque ratios may lead to the development of specific shoulder strengthening programs to prevent muscle imbalance and its consequences. © 2008 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, frugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and postdispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover. Similarly, the magnitude of frugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - The main purpose of the present paper is to provide a general method of fundamental solution (MFS) formulation for two- and three-dimensional eigenproblems without spurious eigenvalues. The spurious eigenvalues are avoided by utilizing the mixed potential method. Illustrated problems in the annular and concentric domains are studied analytically and numerically to demonstrate the issue of spurious eigenvalues by the discrete and continuous versions of the MFS with and without the mixed potential method. The proposed numerical method is then verified with the exact solutions of the benchmark problems in circular and spherical domains with and without holes. Further studies are performed in a three-dimensional peanut shaped domain. In the spirit of the MFS, this scheme is free from meshes, singularities and numerical integrations. © 2006 The Royal Society.

AB  - Dolomite cement is a significant and widespread component of Phanerozoic sucrosic dolomites. Cements in dolomites that were never deeply buried are limpid, have planar faces (non-saddle forms), often distinct zonation in cathodoluminescence and form syntaxial overgrowths on crystals facing pores. Five samples of sucrosic dolomites, interpreted as having had mostly lime-mudstone or wackestone precursors in four carbonate aquifers, provide insights into the abundance of planar cements in sucrosic dolomites. Such cement comprises 11% to 45% (32% mean) of peritidal to sub-tidal dolomites on an outcrop in the Edwards aquifer (Early Cretaceous) of central Texas; 19% to 33% (25% mean) of ramp dolomites in the Hawthorn Group (Oligo-Miocene) and 50% to 70% in shelf dolomites of the Avon Park Formation (Eocene) in the Upper Floridan aquifer of sub-surface peninsular Florida; 18% to 45% (32+% mean) of sub-tidal shelf dolomites in quarry sections of the Burlington-Keokuk Formation (Early Mississippian) in south-eastern Iowa; and 18% to 76% (50% mean) in shallow cores and outcrops of outer-shelf dolomites from the Gambier Limestone (Oligo-Miocene) of South Australia. Backstripping the cement phases revealed by cathodoluminescence colour photomicrographs documents the effects of cements on textural coarsening, pore-space reduction, induration and general 'maturation' of these dolomites. Most pre-Holocene dolomites are multiphase crystalline rocks composed of: (i) seed crystals or 'cores'; (ii) crystal cortices that concentrically enlarged the cores; and (iii) free-space, syntaxial precipitates of limpid cement around the crystals. Remaining CaCO 3 grains and micrite can be replaced by dolomite, but typically they are dissolved between stages (ii) and (iii), creating systems of intercrystal and mouldic pores typical of sucrosic dolomites. Networks of cement overgrowths, aided by water-filled pore systems under hydrostatic to lithostatic pressure, are judged to slow or prevent compaction in sucrosic dolomites. It can be argued that cortex growth involves both replacement of CaCO3 particles and microcementation of their interparticle pores. This interpretation, and the abundance of cements in so many dolomites, would obviate the controversy over the volumetrics of 'replacement dolomitization'. Limpid, planar and syntaxial dolomite cements of early diagenetic origin are interpreted to have precipitated from clear pore waters, at low temperatures (<30 to 35°C) and shallow burial depths (<100m), in water-saturated networks of dolomite 'silt' and 'sand'. Cements in many dolomites in island and continental-aquifer systems appear to result from event-driven processes related to sea-level highstands. Cementation events can follow 'replacement dolomitization' events by time intervals ranging from geologically 'instantaneous' to tens of million years. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Modes of heat exchangers with distributed parameters of lower orders were examined. The mathematical modeling plays an important role in designing and optimizing chemical engineering processes and in studying characteristics and controllability of existing equipment. The model, which considers a counterflow heat exchanger consisting of two concentric cavities is used as a reference model. Another model, which uses arithmetic mean difference in temperature, avoids the temperature overlap effect.

AB  - For prey animals to negotiate successfully the fundamental trade-off between predation and starvation, a realistic assessment of predation risk is vital. Prey responses to conspicuous indicators of risk (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there should also be strong selection for the detection of more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful indicators of risk, since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human 'predators' whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - A modified autoshaping paradigm (significantly different from those previously reported in the summation literature) was employed to allow for the simultaneous assessment of stimulus summation and subtraction in pigeons. The response requirements and the probability of food delivery were adjusted such that towards the end of training 12 of 48 trials ended in food delivery, the same proportion as under testing. Stimuli (outlines of squares of three sizes and colors: A, B, and C) were used that could be presented separately or in any combination of two or three stimuli. Twelve of the pigeons (summation groups) were trained with either A, B, and C or with AB, BC, and CA, and tested with ABC. The remaining 12 pigeons (subtraction groups) received training with ABC but were tested with A, B, and C or with AB, BC, and CA. These groups were further subdivided according to whether stimulus elements were presented either in a concentric or dispersed manner. Summation did not occur; subtraction occurred in the two concentric groups. For interpretation of the results, configural theory, the Rescorla-Wagner model, and the composite-stimulus control model were considered. The results suggest different mechanisms responsible for summation and subtraction. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the result of research conducted under a NEESR award, new design procedures are being proposed for inclusion in the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings for the design of zipper braced frames. A zipper frame is a conventional chevron-braced configuration in which the intersection points of the diagonals have been linked with a vertical element (zipper strut). The intent of the vertical elelment is to force simulataneous buckling of all stories to avoid the soft-story mechanism typical of concentrically braced frames. Zipper frames have been considered as a viable alternative to conventional braced frames in the commentary of the AISC Provisions since their first edition. However, there have been neither specific design recommendations nor definitive studies on the seismic performance of this structural configuration. Based on extensive analytical and experimental work conducted jointly by Georgia Tech, the U. at Buffalo, the U. of Colorado-Boulder and the U. of California-Berkeley, a new design procedure has been developed to ensure ductile and reliable behavior of this structural system. This paper briefly reviews that design procedure and illustrates its application through the design of a 9-story frame used in a critical facility in a high seismic area. © 2007 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Most of designs for water machine just consider normal people’s demands, but the demands of the disabled, for example, the demands and inconvenience of the blind people while using the water machine. This research considered inconvenience of the blind when they use the water machine. We redesigned multiple intelligent functions in a traditional off-the-shelf water machine, including LED display for the temperature of water output, different fixed volume of water output, multi-language voice output for the temperature level and the volume of water output, voice warning for the minimum limit and the maximum limit of the water line in the tank, buttons with braille hints, redundant water collector with concentric circles fillisters designed for the blind to find the outlet position conveniently etc. This intelligent water machine we developed is not only convenient to use for the blind, but also for normal user. It is safer, convenient and so sweet when people use the intelligent drinking water machine. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2007.

AB  - This study seeks to understand the spatial variability of monthly and daily rainfall in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, USA. Monthly spatial statistics are needed to improve downscaling from climate models producing seasonal rainfall forecasts, and spatial correlation of daily rainfall is needed to inform spatial weather generators used in climate risk analysis. We first determined the historical record length that is stationary followed by an analysis of the monthly spatial characteristics of rainfall variables. Rainfall data from 523 weather stations (National Climate Data Center) were obtained for the period 1915-2004 and divided into 15-year subsets for comparisons. Differences in rainfall were found between the most recent 15-year period and all others occurring during the 90-year period of record. Thus only data from 1990 to 2004 (208 weather stations) were used to avoid the detected changes in climate in the region. Correlation, covariance and variance matrices of daily and monthly rainfall amounts were calculated at monthly steps. The same statistics were also computed for frequency of rainfall events and monthly number of rainy days. Results show different spatial patterns at different temporal scales; two spatial patterns were well established. A widely spread correlation in a northeast - southwest direction was found around weather stations during the frontal rainy season, and a concentric short distance-decay in correlations existed around weather stations during the summer convective season. Spatial correlations among daily rainfall amounts are needed for spatial weather generators in a storm-by-storm basis while monthly spatial statistics are needed to ensure the validity of downscaled data from numerical seasonal rainfall forecasts.

AB  - Defenses protect prey, while offenses arm predators. Some defenses and offenses are constitutive (e.g. tortoise shells), while others are phenotypically plastic and not always expressed (e.g. neckteeth in water fleas). All of them are costly and only adaptive at certain prey densities. Here, I analyse such density-dependent effects, applying a functional response model to categorize defenses and offenses and qualitatively predict at which prey densities each category should evolve (if it is constitutive) or be expressed (if it is phenotypically plastic). The categories refer to the step of the predation cycle that a defense or offense affects: (1) search, (2) encounter, (3) detection, (4) attack, or (5) meal. For example, prey warning signals such as red coloration prevent predator attacks and are hence step 4 defenses, while sharp predator eyes enhance detection and are step 3 offenses. My theoretical analyses predict that step 1 defenses, which prevent predators from searching for their next meal (e.g. toxic substances), evolve or are expressed at intermediate prey densities. Other defenses, however, should be most beneficial at low prey densities. Regarding predators, step 1 offenses (e.g. immunity against prey toxins) are predicted to evolve or be expressed at high prey densities, other offenses at intermediate densities. I provide evidence from the literature that supports these predictions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insects that hibernate as adults have a life span of almost a whole year. Hence, they must have extraordinary adaptations for adult survival. In this paper, we study winter survival in two butterflies that hibernate as adults and have multimodal anti-predator defences-the peacock, Inachis io, which has intimidating eyespots that are effective against bird predation, and the small tortoiseshell, Aglais urticae, which does not have an effective secondary defence against birds. We assessed predation on wild butterflies hibernating in the attic of an unheated house, as well as survival of individually marked butterflies placed by hand on different sites in the attic. Our objectives were to assess (1) the number of butterflies that were killed during hibernation, (2) whether survival differed between butterfly species, and (3) how predation was related to hibernation site and the identity of the predator. There was a strong pulse of predation during the first 2 weeks of hibernation: 58% of A. urticae and 53% of I. io were killed during this period. Thereafter, predation decreased and butterfly survival equalled 98% during the final 16 weeks of hibernation. There was no difference in survival between the two butterfly species, but predation was site-specific and more pronounced under light conditions in locations accessible to a climbing rodent, such as the common yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis. We contend that small rodents are likely important predators on overwintering butterflies, both because rodents are active throughout winter when butterflies are torpid and because they occur at similar sites. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In the present study we investigated the behavioural strategies with which freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila) control their flight trajectories during active optomotor stimulation in a free-flight arena. We measured forward, turning and climbing velocities of single flies using high-speed video analysis and estimated the output of a 'Hassenstein-Reichardt' elementary motion detector (EMD) array and the fly's gaze to evaluate flight behaviour in response to a rotating visual panorama. In a stationary visual environment, flight is characterized by flight saccades during which the animals turn on average 120° within 130 ms. In a rotating environment, the fly's behaviour typically changes towards distinct, concentric circular flight paths where the radius of the paths increases with increasing arena velocity. The EMD simulation suggests that this behaviour is driven by a rotation-sensitive EMD detector system that minimizes retinal slip on each compound eye, whereas an expansion-sensitive EMD system with a laterally centred visual focus potentially helps to achieve centring response on the circular flight path. We developed a numerical model based on force balance between horizontal, vertical and lateral forces that allows predictions of flight path curvature at a given locomotor capacity of the fly. The model suggests that turning flight in Drosophila is constrained by the production of centripetal forces needed to avoid side-slip movements. At maximum horizontal velocity this force may account for up to 70% of the fly's body weight during yaw turning. Altogether, our analyses are widely consistent with previous studies on Drosophila free flight and those on the optomotor response under tethered flight conditions.

AB  - The design of brace connections for concentrically braced steel frames detailed for ductile inelastic seismic response is examined. The study focuses on bracing members made of square hollow structural steel shapes with welded slotted connections. Different design strategies are investigated to prevent net section fracture and develop the full tensile capacity of the braces. Connections designs for out-of-plane and in-plane buckling of the braces are also proposed and discussed. The response of a brace sample subjected to monotonic loading as well as under quasi-static cyclic displacement history is examined through detailed finite element analysis. Un-reinforced brace connections are found to be prone to premature fracture under tension, especially when defects are present along the slots cut in the tube walls. Connections designed for out-of-plane and in-plane brace buckling resulted in nearly identical cyclic inelastic brace response. For the out-of-plane buckling design, satisfactory brace end rotation responsewas achieved without the free length gusset plate detail proposed in codes. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Animals possess a range of defensive markings to reduce the risk of predation, including warning colours, camouflage, eyespots and mimicry. These different strategies are frequently considered independently, and with little regard towards predator vision, even though they may be linked in various ways and can be fully understood only in terms of predator perception. For example, camouflage and warning coloration need not be mutually exclusive, and may frequently exploit similar features of visual perception. This paper outlines how different forms of protective markings can be understood from predator perception and illustrates how this is fundamental in determining the mechanisms underlying, and the interrelation between, different strategies. Suggestions are made for future work, and potential mechanisms discussed in relation to various forms of defensive coloration, including disruptive coloration, eyespots, dazzle markings, motion camouflage, aposematism and mimicry. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - The hybridization of optimization techniques can exploit the strengths of different approaches and avoid their weaknesses. In this work we present a hybrid optimization algorithm based on the combination of Evolution Strategies (ES) and Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR). In this hybrid a local algorithm (LWLR) proposes a new solution that is used by a global algorithm (ES) to produce new better solutions. This new hybrid is applied in solving an interesting and difficult problem in astronomy, the two-dimensional fitting of brightness profiles in galaxy images. The use of standardized fitting functions is arguably the most powerful method for measuring the large-scale features (e.g. brightness distribution) and structure of galaxies, specifying parameters that can provide insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we employ the hybrid algorithm ES+LWLR to find models that describe the bidimensional brightness profiles for a set of optical galactic images. Models are created using two functions: de Vaucoleurs and exponential, which produce models that are expressed as sets of concentric generalized ellipses that represent the brightness profiles of the images. The problem can be seen as an optimization problem because we need to minimize the difference between the flux from the model and the flux from the original optical image, following a normalized Euclidean distance. We solved this optimization problem using our hybrid algorithm ES+LWLR. We have obtained results for a set of 100 galaxies, showing that hybrid algorithm is very well suited to solve this problem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - In compression drivers a large membrane is coupled to a small horn throat resulting in high efficiency. For this efficiency to be maintained to high frequencies the volume of the resulting cavity, between horn and membrane, must be kept small. Early workers devised a phase-plug to fill most of the cavity volume and connect membrane to horn throat with concentric annular channels of equal length to avoid destructive interference [1]. Later work, representing the cavity as a flat disc, describes a method of calculating the positions and areas of these annular channels where they exit the cavity, giving least modal excitation, thus avoiding undesirable response irregularities [2]. In this paper the result of applying both the equal path-length and modal approaches to a phase-plug with concentric annular channels coupled to a cavity shaped as a flat disc is further explored. The assumption that the cavity may be represented as a flat disc is investigated by comparing its behavior with that of an axially vibrating rigid spherical cap radiating into a curved cavity. It is demonstrated that channel arrangements derived for a flat disc are not optimum for use in a typical compression driver with a curved cavity. A new methodology for calculating the channel positions and areas giving least modal excitation is described. The impact of the new approach will be illustrated with a practical design.

AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to compare the behavioural profiles in alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, alcohol) and alcohol-avoiding ANA (Alko, non-alcohol) rats. Twelve adult, alcohol-naïve male AA and ANA rats were tested in the recently established multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) test. The more traditional open field and elevated plus-maze tests were used as reference tests. Six weeks after the initial MCSF test, a repeated testing was used to explore differences in acquired recognition after a previous experience. The results revealed distinct differences between the two lines. The ANA rats were generally more active in the three tests. In the MCSF, parameters of risk taking and shelter seeking indicated differences between the two lines. The ANA rats had higher shelter seeking behaviour and less risk taking behaviour than the AA rats. Repeated exposure to the MCSF caused a general decrease in activity and reduction in the number of visits to the various zones, especially evident in the ANA rats. The ANA rats showed more shelter seeking than the AA rats and also more shelter seeking than in the first trial, supporting an "anxiety-like" profile in these rats. In conclusion, the parameters related to risk taking and shelter seeking revealed obvious differences between AA and ANA rats. The higher risk taking behaviour seen in the AA rats might relate to their innate propensity for high voluntary alcohol intake. The results are discussed in relation to the reported neurobiological differences and in relation to other alcohol-preferring and alcohol-avoiding rat lines. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Butterflies that hibernate exhibit particularly efficient defence against predation. A first line of defence is crypsis, and most hibernating butterflies are leaf mimics. When discovered, some species have a second line of defence; the peacock, I. io, when attacked by a predator flicks its wings open exposing large eyespots and performs an intimidating threat display. Here we test the hypothesis that butterflies relying solely on leaf mimicking and butterflies with an intimidating wing pattern, when attacked, exhibit different behavioural suites - because leaf mimicking is best implemented by immobility, whereas intimidating coloration is best implemented by intimidating behaviour. In laboratory experiments blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were allowed 40 min to attack single individuals of three species of butterfly: one relying solely on crypsis, the comma, Polygonia c-album; one relying on intimidating wing pattern in addition to crypsis, the peacock; and one intermediate species, the small tortoiseshell Aglais urticae. The results are in accordance with expectations and demonstrate that: (1) birds take longer to discover the leaf mimicking species, the comma, than the tortoiseshell and the peacock; (2) the comma remained motionless throughout experimental trials but small tortoise-shells and peacocks flicked their wings when attacked; (3) the most intimidating butterfly, the peacock, started flicking its wings at a greater distance from the attacking bird than the small tortoiseshell; and (4) the intimidating pattern and behaviour of peacocks was effective - when discovered, all peacocks survived interactions with blue tits, whereas only 22% of commas and 8% of small tortoiseshells survived. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - Liposomes are vesicles that consist of one or more concentric phospholipidic bilayers organized around an aqueous inner compartment. They are carriers of drugs, biomolecules and diagnostic agents. The stability of liposomes can be influenced by chemical or physical factors. Once injected in the circulatory system, conventional liposomes suffer uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system. To avoid such a capture, non-conventional or Stealth® liposomes were developed, which are coated by hydrophilic components. Specific ligand had been incorporated in their surface so as to control the drug release and selectivity, thereby originating the targeted liposomes. In general, all preparation methods of liposomes include the hydration of lipidic film followed by sonication or extrusion to reduce the mean size of vesicles. After preparation, the vesicles are characterized by size, chemical constitution, and amount of encapsulated material. In this review it is shown that the liposomes offer effectiveness and safety in comparison with many conventional treatments. In spite of the existence of a few liposomal formulations available since early 80's, which are used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections and cancer, many technological and biological issues remain as a challenge. In this scenario, liposomes have extensively been studied in order to improve their in vivo stability in the treatment of several diseases, including cancer.

AB  - Twenty-three isolates of Rhizoctonia spp. from agronomic crops and turfgrasses were characterized by cytological and pathological methods in order to establish the identity, pathogenicity, and virulence of Rhizoctonia spp. and anastomosis groups that occur on these hosts in Mississippi. Twelve isolates were identified as R. solani, including the five anastomosis groups (AGs) AG-1-IB, AG-2-2, AG-4, AG-5, and AG-13. Rhizoctonia zeae, R. oryzae, and eight binucleate Rhizoctonia sp., including R. cerealis, also were identified. R. solani AG-4 isolates were consistently the most virulent isolates on all hosts in pathogenicity evaluations. Pathogenicity of AG-2-2 and AG-5 isolates, binucleate Rhizoctonia spp., and R. oryzae varied between hosts. Two AG-2-2 isolates from bermudagrass or wheat were determined to be clonal isolates, with numerous self-anastomosis reactions. R. solani (AG-1-IB) was pathogenic on all graminaceous hosts. R. cerealis produced sharp eyespot symptoms on wheat and corn and minimal symptoms on cotton and soybean. This is a first report of R. cerealis as a pathogen of corn. R. zeae isolates were pathogenic on all hosts, including cotton and soybean. These results indicate that a diverse group of Rhizoctonia spp. occurs as pathogens on a wide variety of agronomic crops and turfgrasses in Mississippi. © 2007 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Serially repeated pattern elements on butterfly wings offer the opportunity for integrating genetic, developmental, and functional aspects towards understanding morphological diversification and the evolution of individuality. We use captive populations of Bicyclus anynana butterflies, an emerging model in evolutionary developmental biology, to explore the genetic and developmental basis of compartmentalized changes in eyespot patterns. There is much variation for different aspects of eyespot morphology, and knowledge about the genetic pathways and developmental processes involved in eyespot formation. Also, despite the strong correlations across all eyespots in one butterfly, B. anynana shows great potential for independent changes in the size of individual eyespots. It is, however, unclear to what extent the genetic and developmental processes underlying eyespot formation change in a localized manner to enable such individualization. We use micromanipulations of developing wings to dissect the contribution of different components of eyespot development to quantitative differences in eyespot size on one wing surface. Reciprocal transplants of presumptive eyespot foci between artificial selection lines and controls suggest that while localized antagonistic changes in eyespot size rely mostly on localized changes in focal signal strength, concerted changes depend greatly on epidermal response sensitivities. This potentially reflects differences between the signal-response components of eyespot formation in the degrees of compartmentalization and/or the temporal pattern of selection. We also report on the phenotypic analysis of a number of mutant stocks demonstrating how single alleles can affect different eyespots in concert or independently, and thus contribute to the individualization of serially repeated traits. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A variant of the spatial autocorrelation method is studied. The horizontal components of elastic wavefields obtained for a dense set of stations on two concentric circumferences are analyzed. The Fourier spectra of the radial components are azimuthally averaged for the external (radius Re) and the internal (radius Ri) circles. It can be shown, that the ratio of both mean spectra is equal to the quotient of the first order Bessel functions evaluated in ωRe/cR and ωRi/cR, respectively, where ω is the circular frequency and cR the phase velocity of Rayleigh waves for ω. In practice, when seismic noise is recorded at these arrays it is possible to determine a dispersion curve for Rayleigh waves. The dispersion curve for Love waves may be determined applying an analogous procedure to the tangential components. Thus, the joint inversion of both curves should allow us to obtain better constrained soil models. The available wavelength range and the capacity of the array are strongly dependent on the array aperture and on the number of sensors. The radii of the circles must be carefully selected to avoid error magnifications in the computation of velocities, and reach enough level of resolution. Practical relations between the number of sensors, the radii of circumferences and wavelength range are proposed. At last, an example of this methodology to real microtremor is shown.

AB  - Acute epiploic appendagitis most commonly manifests with acute lower quadrant pain. Its clinical features are similar to those of acute diverticulitis or, less commonly, acute appendicitis. The conditions that may mimic acute epiploic appendagitis at computed tomography (CT) include acute omental infarction, mesenteric panniculitis, fat-containing tumor, and primary and secondary acute inflammatory processes in the large bowel (eg, diverticulitis and appendicitis). Whereas the location of acute epiploic appendagitis is most commonly adjacent to the sigmoid colon, acute omental infarction is typically located in the right lower quadrant and often is mistaken for acute appendicitis. It is important to correctly diagnose acute epiploic appendagitis and acute omental infarction on CT images because these conditions may be mistaken for acute abdomen, and the mistake may lead to unnecessary surgery. The CT features of acute epiploic appendagitis include an oval lesion 1.5-3.5 cm in diameter, with attenuation similar to that of fat and with surrounding inflammatory changes, that abuts the anterior sigmoid colon wall. The CT features of acute omental infarction include a well-circumscribed triangular or oval heterogeneous fatty mass with a whorled pattern of concentric linear fat stranding between the anterior abdominal wall and the transverse or ascending colon. As CT increasingly is used for the evaluation of acute abdomen, radiologists are likely to see acute epiploic appendagitis and its mimics more often. Recognition of these conditions on CT images will allow appropriate management of acute abdominal pain and may help to prevent unnecessary surgery. ©RSNA, 2005.

AB  - Various simple and easy-to-use fiber-optic interconnect technologies are offered that reduce maintenance costs of a cable. These technologies include fiber-optic cable cassettes, protective union adapter, and tone traceable fiber-optic cables. Fiber-optic cable cassettes offer a unique ability to manage excess cable lengths, and the glass and plastic optical fibers exposed to sharp bends exhibit increased optical insertion loss and stress birefringence. Protective union adapters achieve low-loss interconnection same as standard adapters by utilizing stubs with high concentricity. Traceable fiber-optic cables ensure that the tracing signal travels along the cable under test and prevent unwanted short-circuiting of the voltage tone. Fiber-optic cabling and interconnects offer cost effective unlimited bandwidth that is more than the performance of copper and wireless systems.

AB  - Sixteen peacocks Inachis io (L.) and one red admiral Vanessa atalanta (L.) were killed by hornets Vespa crabro during a four day observation period in August 2002 on butterflies feeding on fermenting plums. Four successful attacks on peacocks were directly observed, and were invariably preceded by the butterfly opening its wings when attacked. When feeding, peacocks usually kept their wings closed and only flicked their wings open to prevent another approaching insect from alighting on the plum. Wing-flicking behaviour by peacocks is effective when thwarting attacks from birds, but was fatal when practised against hornets. A hypothesis for the evolution of intimidating eyespots on butterfly wings is advanced, suggesting that it is preceded by, and associated with, wing-flicking behaviour which in turn is associated with fruit- or sap-feeding. © Entomologica Fennica. 2005.

AB  - Aims: The purpose of this study was to estimate the risk of ACL rupture in top level judo athletes. Methods: The risk of ACL rupture has been widely reported, and is higher in some sports as soccer, handball and basketball, particularly in females. But other sports as judo have not been studied. We carried out a prospective 6 years study in young top level males and females judo athletes (16 years old), and compared the results with concentric isokinetic knee evaluation. Results: The incidence of ACL rupture is very high (12,5%), and approximately the same for males and females. There is no difference in hamstrings/quadriceps ratio between the two groups (rupture or not). But this ratio is slightly lower at high speed in females group with rupture. The heavier athletes, with higher fat mass, (particularly in the females group) are more at risk of rupture. Conclusion: Preventions programs should be discussed in respect of these preliminary results, as proposed in other sports, as soccer and volleyball. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Symptoms of major virus, bacterial and fungal diseases infecting potatoes are demonstrated. From the group of potato viruses potato virus Y (PVY) and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) are presented. The PVY strain ntn causes severe necrotic symptoms on tubers, PLRV infects the whole plant. Both viruses are transmitted by aphids. The soft rot disease of the tubers and black leg is caused by the bacterium Erwinia carotovora. The quarantine disease caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum can be detected during early infection by a loss of turgor and by wilting of the whole plant at a late stage, since the bacterium is a vascular pathogen. There are many ways of spread of this bacterium that poses a permanent threat of infection. Another potato quarantine bacterium is Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, the causal agent of the potato ring rot disease. This bacterium grows optimal at low temperatures and it spreads via xylem throughout all parts of the plant including daughter tubers. Potato wart caused by Synchytrium endobioticum is a quarantine disease as well The quarantine status of Synchytrium endobioticum is due to the so-called winter sori which survive and remain infective in the soil for 20 years or more. No appropriate chemical treatments are available, only breeding for resistance. The dry rot disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium infecting mainly stored tubers. The fungus which causes the most severe damage on potatoes worldwide is Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight disease. There are two mating types, increasing the genetic variability and the survival (oospores) of this fungus until the next growing season. Tubers are also infected and are a latent reservoir for further infections during the next growing season. Early blight is caused by Alternaria species and the symptoms are characteristical brown spots with concentric rings on the leaves. Rhizoctonia solani is the causal agent of black scurf. Predominant black sclerotia are found on the skin of infected tubers. Rhizoctonia solani can overwinter in the soil and therefore can only be partly controlled by chemically dressing seed tubers. To prevent a further spread of the disease in storage, a fast drying and cooling of the tubers is recommended. Silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani) lately has become an increasing problem during storage. © Wageningen Academic Publishers. The Netherlands, 2006. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, scientists at Tianjin University and at the FiberHome Telecommunication Technologies Co. Ltd. in Wuhan, both in China, have showed an all-fiber tunable bandpass filter avoiding the complex tuning mechanisms of previous all-fiber filters. The new filter's bandwidth and center frequency are set merely by changing the bend radii of a pair of fibers, where the bend in one fiber sets the long-wavelength cutoff and the other sets the short wavelength cutoff. The two fibers that were spliced together in creating a tunable bandpass filter were a solid-core photonic bandgap fiber and a concentric-ring, one-dimensional Bragg reflection fiber. By adjusting the bend radii of the two fibers, scientists could tune the filter's bandwidth between 50 and 250nm.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to assess the isokinetic profile of the flexor and extensor muscles of the knee within a population of rugby players. Methods and Population: This was a descriptive study. The rugby players underwent bilateral isokinetic assessment of knee flexion and extension on a CON-TREX MJ isokinetic dynamometer functioning at four angular frequencies - 90, 120, 180 and 240°/s - in a concentric manner. The isokinetic parameters were peak torque, mean power, and mean work in relation to weight and femoral bicep: quadriceps ratio. The population included 16 "Federal 1" (semi-professional) rugby players with mean age 25 years (range 20-33 years). The players were divided into two groups: "forward" players (props, hookers, second line, third line) and "back" players (scrum, inside, center, wing, tail). Results: The values of the isokinetic parameters did not reveal use of a preferred limb. Consequently, peak torque and mean power were higher in forward players than back players, whereas back players showed a higher relative power throughout the isokinetic test. Conclusion: Among rugby players, forward and back players showed differences in several isokinetic parameters. Accurate knowledge of the equilibrium between the knee's effector muscles is important for stability of the joint, to not only minimize articular accidents but also pinpoint force imbalances, thereby preventing muscular lesions during the sports season. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Exploration and risk behaviour (risk assessment/risk taking) are critical to enable mice to cope with novel situations and gain control over their environment. Evaluation of those behaviourswould therefore be a useful part of early phenotypic characterization of geneticallymodifiedmice, allowing early detection of behavioural phenotypes that require special attention and/or are of scientific interest. This study aimed to evaluate exploration and risk behaviour in pre-weaning mice using the novel cage test, which consists in exploration of a novel, clean,Makrolon type III cage. The results of this test were compared with those obtained in more complex and established tests to which the same mice were subjected as adolescents and young adults. Mice of two inbred strains (129S6/Bkl, n=10; C57BL/6Bkl, n=10) and one hybrid (B6CBAF1/Bkl, n=10) were used for validation of the test. The animals were tested in the novel cage (at weaning), the open field test (at 5 weeks), and from 9 weeks of age in three other tests: the elevated plus-maze, the concentric square field and the rat exposure test. The novel cage test effectively detected strain differences in pre-weaning mice as regards exploration and risk behaviour and the results were largely consistent with those obtained in the established tests later in life. In all tests 129S6 displayed a low locomotion and high risk assessment, while C57BL/6 and B6CBAF1 showed high locomotion and exploration. In addition high levels of risk taking were observed in C57BL/6. The novel cage test is rapid, requires no special equipment and is as discriminatory as more complex tests in detecting strain/genotype differences. This suggests that the novel cage test is a valuable tool for evaluation of exploration, risk assessment and risk taking in juvenile mice. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The projective geometric properties of two principal-axes aligned (PAA) conics in a model plane are investigated in this paper by utilized the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED). We demonstrate that one constraint on the image of the absolute conic (IAC) can be obtained from a single image of two PAA conics even if their parameters are unknown. And if the eccentricity of one of the two conics is given, two constraints on the IAC can be obtained. An important merit of the algorithm using PAA is that it can be employed to avoid the ambiguities when estimating extrinsic parameters in the calibration algorithms using concentric circles. We evaluate the characteristics and robustness of the proposed algorithm in experiments with synthetic and real data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - The eyespot apparatus (EA) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii P. A. Dang. consists of two layers of carotenoid-rich lipid globules subtended by thylakoids. The outermost globule layer is additionally associated with the chloroplast envelope membranes and the plasma membrane. In a recent proteomic approach, we identified 202 proteins from isolated EAs of C. reinhardtii via at least two peptides, including, for example, structural components, signalling-related proteins, and photosynthetic-related membrane proteins. Here, we have analyzed the proteins of the EA with regard to their topological distribution using thermolysin to find out whether the arrangement of globules and membranes provides protection mechanisms for some of them. From about 230 protein spots separated on two-dimensional gels, the majority were degraded by thermolysin. Five major protein spots were protected against the action of this protease. These proteins and some that were degradable were identified by mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the thermolysin-resistant proteins represented the α and β subunits of the soluble CF1 complex of the chloroplast ATP synthase. Degradable proteins included typical membrane proteins like LHCs, demonstrating that thermolysin is not in general sterically prevented by the EA structure from reaching membrane-associated proteins. A control experiment showed that the CF1 complex of thylakoids is efficiently degraded by thermolysin. Blue native PAGE of thermolysin-treated EAs followed by SDS-PAGE revealed that the α and β subunits are present in conjunction with the γ subunit in a thermolysin-resistant complex. These results provide strong evidence that a significant proportion of these ATP-synthase subunits have a specialized localization and function within the EA of C. reinhardtii. © 2007 by the Phycological Society of America.

AB  - Fault rings can be used to guide messages bypass faulty nodes/links in a fault tolerant interconnection network. However, nodes on the fault ring become hot spots, thus causing uneven distribution of the traffic loads. To avoid such traffic congestion, a concept of the balanced ring is proposed in this paper. The proposed balanced ring, defined as concentric rings of a given fault ring, can be applied to the fault tolerant routing algorithms for mesh and torus topologies. By properly guiding messages to route on the balanced ring and the fault ring, more balanced link utilization and greatly reduced traffic congestion can be achieved on a fault tolerant network. Methods of applying the balanced ring concept to some published fault tolerant routing algorithms are discussed. Proof of deadlock and livelock freedom is also presented. The use of balanced ring does not need to add new virtual channels. The performance of two routing algorithms with and without the balanced ring is simulated and evaluated. The results indicate that routing algorithms with the balanced rings constantly yield larger throughput and smaller latency than those without. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gaudy plumage coloration is a widespread ornamental trait in birds and thought to be sexually selected. Although much attention has been devoted to structural coloration reflecting in UV, the signaling function of structural colors lacking UV reflectance and those that exhibit iridescence coloration are poorly documented. The train of the peacock (Pavo cristatus), a classical example of a sexually selected trait, is composed of iridescent structurally colored eyespots not reflecting in UV. Until today, the role played by the structural color of the eyespots in female mate choice has never been investigated using spectrometry. We measured eyespot coloration from a stationary angle (static coloration) and the change in coloration resulting from different angles (iridescent coloration). We assessed coloration with reflectance spectrometry, and we analyzed reflectance spectra using 2 methods. First, we extracted the reflectance spectra shape descriptors hue, brightness, and chroma. Second, we computed color and brightness contrasts signaled by eyespot feathers, taking peafowl color visual sensitivity into account. Iridescence was estimated by the maximal change for all parameters. Brightness was correlated with male mating success. The maximal change in color contrast was correlated with both the frequency of male visitation by females and male mating success. These results suggest that peahens can use both static and dynamic (i.e., iridescent) aspects of plumage structural coloration as signals to detect and choose their mates. © The Author 2007.

AB  - Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals. © The Author 2008.

AB  - In this study hysteretic behaviors of Hollow Structural Section (HSS) bracing members having different width-thickness ratios (w/t ratio) are investigated. For this purpose, an experimental study was carried out using 7 specimens under quasi static symmetric reversed cyclic loading in tension and compression. Loading pattern was determined based on the results of a nonlinear dynamic time history analysis of a 3 story concentric braced frame under earthquake ground motions. This study observed that HSS specimens having a small w/t ratio experienced early fracture at the slotted end. It is noted that those specimens satisfied the requirement of w/t ratio for special concentric braced frames. To avoid this problem, this study proposed a design equation. The design equation was verified by additional experimental tests of two specimens designed according to the proposed design equation.

AB  - Communication among scientists must be clear and concise to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretations. The selection of words must be based on accepted definitions. The fields of biomechanics, muscle physiology, and exercise science have had a particularly difficult time with terminology, arising from the complexity of muscle contractions and by the use of inappropriate terminology by scientists. The dictionary definition of the verb "contract," specifically for the case of muscle, is "to undergo an increase in tension, or force, and become shorter." Under all circumstances, an activated muscle generates force, but an activated muscle generating force does not invariably shorten! During the 1920s and 1930s, investigators recognized that the interaction between the force generated by the muscle and the load on the muscle results in either shortening, no length change (isometric), or lengthening of the muscle. The recognition that muscles perform three different types of "contractions" required that contraction be redefined as "to undergo activation and generate force." Modifiers of contraction are then needed to clarify the lack of movement or the directionality of movement. Despite the contradiction, for 75 years the lack of movement has been termed an "isometric contraction." The directionality of the movement is then best described by the adjectives "shortening" and "lengthening." The definitions of "concentric" as "having the same center" and of "eccentric" as "not having the same center" are consistent with hypertrophy, or remodeling of the heart muscle, but are inappropriate to describe the contractions of skeletal muscles.

AB  - The Gemini Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) will be used with the ALTAIR adaptive optics system on Gemini North. NIFS uses a reflective, concentric, integral field unit (IFU) to reformat its focal plane. The concentric IFU design integrates the IFU with the spectrograph collimator to form a dedicated IFU instrument. The IFU channels are identical and fanned about a single axis passing through the image slicer. The spherical optical surfaces of the spectrograph collimator are all concentric and centered on this fanning axis. The grating is also located on the fanning axis, and the system is arranged to produce coincident pupil images at the grating. In this way, each channel of the IFU performs as if it is on-axis. This avoids complications due to off-axis angles that are intrinsic to other reflective IFU designs.

AB  - The "deflection hypothesis" asserts that conspicuous marginal patches on insect wings function to deflect predator attacks toward such patches and away from more vital body parts. As a result of selection from predator attacks, these marks are predicted to increase the probability of escape by tearing relatively easily. To test if a conspicuous marginal patch is weak relative to a homologous wing area without such a patch, hindwing tear weight was compared among three Pierella species (Satyrinae) differing in the presence of a conspicuous patch in the hindwing tornus. The species with a conspicuous white hindwing patch (P. astyoche) had significantly lower tear weights than the two species lacking the patch (P. lamia and P. lena). Forewing length did not explain variation in wing-tear weight, but wing-tear weight was positively related to insect age in a manner consistent with the deflection hypothesis. Older individuals of P. lamia and P. lena had higher tear weight, whereas this relationship was absent in P. astyoche. These results represent the first direct evidence that deflection marks on butterfly wings are relatively weak and should have an increased tendency to tear when handled by a predator.

AB  - Cold production is a non-thermal process in which sand is intentionally produced with oil in order to enhance oil recovery. In order to develop a full numerical model using a reservoir simulator, of the cold production process, it is necessary to know the effect of producing large quantities of sand on the overall permeability of the formation. A pressure depletion experiment was performed in order to simulate the production of sand, oil and gas into perforations in a well and within the formation during the cold production process. A numerical simulation of the flow of oil and gas into the orifices before sand production was used to calculate the pressure gradient at the orifices. A significant interference effect was observed during wormhole growth in the sand pack saturated with live oil with two vertically aligned orifices at one end. A sand-filled channel (wormhole) 36 cm in length by 17 cm in diameter developed from the top orifice, whereas only a small sand-filled cavity developed from the bottom orifice. The calculated pressure gradient at the top orifice at the onset of sand production (7.5 MPa/m) was slightly higher than at the bottom orifice (7.1 MPa/m). The growth of the top wormhole decreased the pressure gradient at the bottom orifice and therefore prevented the growth of a bottom wormhole. The experiment suggests that wormholes do not develop from each perforation in a well. The flow of oil and gas at the surface of a stationary wormhole, similar in size to the top wormhole, was modeled numerically for two different boundaries: (1) a 30-cm diameter, 80-cm long sand pack, and (2) an 80-cm oil sand hemisphere. The calculated pressure gradients at the surface of the wormhole within the 80-cm sand hemisphere were one order of magnitude larger than the pressure gradients at the surface of the wormhole within the sand pack. These simulations suggest that the diameter of wormhole in the field is significantly greater than 17 cm. The wormhole was composed of a central channel of loose sand surrounded by concentric tensile failure bands. These tensile failure bands likely weaken the sand at the surface of the wormhole and allow it to be produced more easily. This weakening effect would explain the lower pressure gradients calculated at the surface of the wormhole compared to the critical pressure gradient for sand production predicted by Bratli and Risnes [SPE J. (April 1981) 236]. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Feathers are complex, branched keratin structures that exhibit a diversity of pigmentation patterns. Feather pigments are transferred into developing feather keratinocytes from pigment cells that migrate into the tubular feather germ from the dermis. Within-feather pigment patterns are determined by differential pigmentation of keratinocytes within independent barb ridges during feather development. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine which keratinocytes receive pigment. We apply reaction-diffusion models to the growth of within-feather pigment patterns based on a realistic model of feather growth. These models accurately simulate the growth of a diversity of the within-feather pigmentation patterns found in real feathers, including a central patch, a 'hollow' central patch, concentric central patches, bars, chevrons, a central circular spot, rows of paired spots, and arrays of offset dots. The models can also simulate the complex transitions between distinct pigmentation patterns among feathers observed in real avian plumages, including transitions from bars to chevrons, bars to paired dots, and bars to arrays of dots. The congruence between the developmental dynamics of the simulated and observed feather patterns indicates that the reaction-diffusion models provide a realistic and accurate description of the determination of pigment pattern within avian feather follicles. The models support the hypothesis that within-feather pigmentation patterning is determined by antagonistic interactions among molecular expression gradients within the tubular follicle and feather germ.

AB  - The investigation of the stability behavior of slender columns with cracks is an important problem and finds applications in structural, mechanical and aerospace engineering. This study investigates the buckling of slender prismatic columns with a single nonpropagating edge crack subjected to concentrated vertical loads. The transfer matrix method and fundamental solutions of intact columns (columns without any cracks) are combined for determining the buckling loads of cracked columns. The cracked section is modeled by a massless rotational spring whose flexibility depends on the local flexibility induced by the crack. Eigenvalue equations are obtained explicitly for columns with various end conditions, from second order determinants. Numerical examples show that the effects of a crack on the buckling load of a column depend on the depth and the location of the crack. As expected, buckling load decreases conspicuously as the crack depth increases. For a constant crack depth, a crack located in the section of the maximum bending moment causes the largest decrease in the buckling load. On the other hand, if the crack is located just in the inflexion point at the corresponding intact column, it has no effect on the buckling load. The study showed that the transfer matrix method is a simple and efficient method with which to analyze cracked columns. © Tübi̇tak.

AB  - Midface rejuvenation surgery is most challenging. The margin of error for the lower lid is on the order of 0.5 mm, and the cosmetic result can sometimes look unnatural. A minimally invasive technique for malar and lower lid lift is proposed. Two incisions are used: the standard subciliary lower eyelid incision and one on the lateral part of the upper eyelid. Through these incisions a skin flap lower eyelid dissection and a subperiosteal malar dissection are performed. The arcus marginalis itself is not transected as is the case when the malar area is entered from the lower eyelid. Rather, a subperiosteral release of the arcus marginalis is performed through a muscle-splitting incision at the lateral canthus. Eyelid malposition is avoided because the muscles, vessels, and nerves converging toward the medial canthus are not interrupted. The subperiosteal dissection of the arcus marginalis extends to the medial canthus and also releases the insertion of the orbicularis oculi superior malar part. Consequently, all the attachments of the tear trough are released. Two subperiosteal suspensions connect the central part of the nasolabial volume and, more laterally, the central part of the malar area to the inferolateral orbital rim. The elevation of the malar volume resulting from these suspensions is concentric with the orbit. A final third suspension vertically connects the orbicularis oculi muscle with the underlying periosteum to the bone of the lateral orbital rim. Significant skin excess is removed from the lower eyelid. Complete disinsertion of the tear trough attachments combined with the malar elevation treats the entire palpebromalar groove. The lifted fat volume fills the space resulting from the subperiosteal disinsertion. A safer, more natural and more reliable result is achieved because the vectors of traction with this technique are exactly opposite those of the midface aging process, and because a very stable fixation is created between the lifted malar periosteum and the malar and latero-orbital rim bones. © 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this work is to individuate the effects of different muscular strength training methodologies, on the risk of injuries in the soccer game with 5 players. Usually, the efficacy of the athletic preparation is valued in relation to the performance improvement in the different motor expressions speeded up from the specific discipline or in relation to the keeping of the same performance for all the sports season. The evaluation of the presented training, through the definition of costs, for what concerns injuries and benefits, for what concerns the evaluation of the motor skills, can help the technical staff to optimise the performance, avoiding penalizing interruptions. Methods. It has been monitored the injuries of 2 groups of soccer players subjected to 2 different strength trainings: by means of overloads (GS) and multi-jumps (GMB). The evaluation of the elevation of the centre of gravity, through concentric contraction and stretching-shortening cycle, has been realized by means of a conductance - spring board Ergojump of Bosco, according to the-squat jump protocol (SJ) and the counter movement jump (CMJ). The acceleration has been estimated through a sprint of 20 m with the start from a still point; the evaluation of the maximal aerobic speed (VMA) has been realized through the test of Léger, version maximal multistage 20 m shuttle. In order to evaluate the risk of injurie, it has been calculated the index for 1 000 h of sports activity, without considering the days of inability deriving from a bony, muscular or articular contusion. Results. The GS has pointed out a risk of injurie of 29.3 h of inability every 1 000 hof activity, against 102.4 h of inability recorded in GMB. There is a significant difference (p<0.001). The Gs has also underlined very few differences as for the elevation of centre of gravity, but significant variations as for the VMA (p<0.05). Conclusion. The report has underlined that the power activities realized by multi-jumps have a risk of injury which is higher, compared with the activities realized with overloadings. It is also possible to hypotisize that such a high injury rate includes the evolution of some movement abilities, with a particular reference to the ability of speeding up and to the VMA. Controlling the efficacy of the athletic preparation, for what concerns risks, besides benefits, has pointed out the problem of the concurrent training in the sports plays: that is the influence and the transfer of adapting oneself, deriving from the training sessions for movement performances in reciprocal metabolic competition. The preposition of jump-trainings, rather than the replacement of this with overloads, represents the natural succession of it.

AB  - Two familial cerebro-vascular diseases characterized by different cerebral arterial pathologies and presenting in non-hypertensive young and middle-aged adults are described. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by the deposition of smudged periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules known as granular osmiophilic materials (GOM) in the media of small arteries and arterioles. The medial smooth muscle cells are completely lost, and intense adventitial fibrosis is present. Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), or Maeda syndrome, is characterized by intense arteriolosclerosis without GOM deposition. Fibrous intimal proliferation, hyaline degeneration of the media, thickening and splitting of the internal elastic lamina, and concentric narrowing of the lumen are characteristic features. In PAS preparation, small arteries are occasionally stained homogeneously due to exudative changes, but never exhibit granular appearance in CARASIL (Maeda syndrome). Each of the small arterial changes is intense in the cerebral medullary and leptomeningeal arteries, leading to multifocal, confluent, or diffuse ischemic changes in the cerebrum. The authors suggest that CARASIL be referred to as 'Maeda syndrome' or 'CARASIL (Maeda syndrome)' to avoid confusion with CADASIL.

AB  - The on-going mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached historic proportions. There is an operational need for efficient and cost-effective methods to identify red attack trees in these areas. In this paper, we examine the use of an unsupervised clustering 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery for the detection of mountain pine beetle red attack at sites with low and medium levels of attack. Independent validation data were collected from aerial photography and were used to determine the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery. Concentric buffers, in 1-m increments to a maximum of 4 m, were applied to red attack pixels to characterize attribute accuracy as a function of positional accuracy. When a one-pixel buffer (4 m) is applied, the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery was 71% (low attack) and 92% (medium attack). Analysis of red attack trees that were omitted in the analysis of the multispectral IKONOS image indicated that detection of red attack was most effective for larger tree crowns (diameter > 1.5 m) that were less than 11 m from other red attack trees. These results demonstrate that the unsupervised classification of mountain pine beetle red attack using multispectral IKONOS imagery is an operationally viable approach.

AB  - A new method for the speciation analysis of selenite (Se-IV), selenate (Se-VI), and selenocyanate (SeCN-) is described and first results are presented on the distribution of these species in wastewater samples from a Brazilian oil refinery plant. The method is based on the ion chromatographic separation of these species followed by on-line detection of 77Se, 78Se, and 82Se using quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The system employed consisted of a HPLC pump equipped with a manual syringe loading injector, and an anion exchange column (Metrosep A Supp1), the latter interfaced with the ICPMS via a concentric nebulizer-cyclonic spray chamber sample introduction device. Several eluents already described in the literature for the speciation analysis of inorganic selenium were tested, permitting in most cases a good separation of Se(IV) and Se(VI), however, resulting all in very long residence times (> 30 min) and associated peak broadening for the SeCN- ion. This drawback could be effectively avoided by using as the mobile phase a solution of cyanuric acid (3 mmol L-1), modified with acetonitrile (2% v/v) and percchlorate acid (2.5 mmol L-1). Typical retention times (s) for the three analyte species were: selenite (210) < selenate (250) < selenocyanate (450). Repeatabilities in peak position were better than 1% and in peak area evaluation about 3%. Absolute limits of detection (in ng) for these species using an ELAN 5000 instrument and a 500-μL sample injection loop are 0.04, 0.05 and 0.09, respectively. No certified reference materials were available for this study, however, results on spiked wastewater samples showed acceptable recoveries (80-110%) and repeatabilities (RSD < 5%), thus validating this method for its intended purpose. Once optimized, the method was applied to wastewater samples from an oil refinery plant. In all samples until now analyzed, selenocyanate was by far the most abundant selenium species reaching concentrations of up to 90 μg L-1. Selenite was detected only in one sample and selenate could not identified in any of the samples analyzed. Total concentrations of selenium in most samples, assessed by hydride generation ICPMS and by solution nebulization inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES), exceeded those obtained from speciation analysis, indicating the presence of other selenium species not observed by the here used methodology. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows phenotypic plasticity in its ventral wing pattern as an adaptive response to wet-dry seasonality. Wet season form individuals have large eyespots, whereas individuals of the dry season generation have small eyespots. In the laboratory these forms can be obtained by rearing larvae at high and low temperatures, respectively. To study the extent to which the shape of the nearly linear reaction norms for eyespot size can be changed we applied four generations of sib selection by rearing full-sib families across three temperatures. In addition, we measured ecdysteroid titres shortly after pupation in the final generation. Although phenotypic variation in shape was present initially, the experiment yielded lines with reaction norms with similar shapes but different elevations. High, positive genetic correlation across temperatures can explain this lack of response. Differences in ecdysteroid titres did not readily relate to differences in eyespot size.

AB  - A quasi-steady multi-mode heat-transfer model for boiler concentric-tube overfire air ports has been developed that predicts the effect of geometry, furnace heat source and heat sink temperatures, axial injector wall conduction, and coolant flow rate on the tube wall temperature distributions. The model imposes a radiation boundary condition at the outlet tip of the ports, which acts as a heat source. The model was validated using field data and showed that both the airflow distribution in the ports and tube diameter can be used to control the maximum tube wall temperature. This helps avoid tube overheating and thermal degradation. For nominal operating conditions, highly nonlinear axial temperature distributions were observed in both tubes near the hot outlet end of the port.

AB  - The eyespots on the ventral wings of Bicyclus anynana butterflies are exposed when at rest and interact with predators. Those on the dorsal surface are not exposed in this way, and may be involved in courtship and mate choice. In this study, we examined whether the size and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of dorsal eyespots are reliable signals of male quality. High developmental stability is considered to result in low FA, and to be associated with high quality. Individuals of high quality are predicted to produce sexually selected traits that are large and symmetrical, at a relatively low cost. In this study, we manipulated eyespot development to uncouple eyespot size and FA in order to examine their independent roles in signalling to the female. Individual females in cages were given the choice between two or three males differing in eyespot traits. The results indicate that although size per se of the eyespots is used as a signal, FA and wing size are not. We discuss the use of FA in studies of sexual selection and aspects of sexual selection on dorsal eyespot size.

AB  - Processing efficiency theory predicts that anxiety reduces the processing capacity of working memory and has detrimental effects on performance. When tasks place little demand on working memory, the negative effects of anxiety can be avoided by increasing effort. Although performance efficiency decreases, there is no change in performance effectiveness. When tasks impose a heavy demand on working memory, however, anxiety leads to decrements in efficiency and effectiveness. These presumptions were tested using a modified table tennis task that placed low (LWM) and high (HWM) demands on working memory. Cognitive anxiety was manipulated through a competitive ranking structure and prize money. Participants' accuracy in hitting concentric circle targets in predetermined sequences was taken as a measure of performance effectiveness, while probe reaction time (PRT), perceived mental effort (RSME), visual search data, and arm kinematics were recorded as measures of efficiency. Anxiety had a negative effect on performance effectiveness in both LWM and HWM tasks. There was an increase in frequency of gaze and in PRT and RSME values in both tasks under high vs. low anxiety conditions, implying decrements in performance efficiency. However, participants spent more time tracking the ball in the HWM task and employed a shorter tau margin when anxious. Although anxiety unpaired performance effectiveness and efficiency, decrements in efficiency were more pronounced in the HWM task than in the LWM task, providing support for processing efficiency theory.

AB  - Purpose: To test whether active and passive warm-up conducted before eccentric exercise attenuates clinical markers of muscle damage. Methods: Untrained subjects were exposed to one of five conditions: low-heat passive warm-up (N = 10), high-heat passive warm-up (N = 4), or active warm-up (N = 9), preceding eccentric exercise; eccentric exercise without warm-up (N = 10); or high-heat passive warm-up without eccentric exercise (N = 10). Passive warm-up of the elbow flexors was achieved using pulsed short-wave diathermy, and active warm-up was achieved by concentric contraction. Creatine kinase (CK) activity, strength, range of motion, swelling, and muscle soreness were observed before treatment (baseline) and 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after treatment. Results: High-heat passive warm-up without eccentric exercise did not affect any marker of muscle damage and was used as our control group. Markers of muscle damage were not different between groups that did or did not conduct warm-up before eccentric exercise. The active warm-up and eccentric groups exhibited a greater circumferential increase than controls (P < 0.0002), however, that was not observed after passive warm-up. Additionally, the active warm-up group exhibited a greater CK response than controls at 72 h (P < 0.05). The high-heat passive warm-up before eccentric exercise group exhibited significant change from controls at the least number of time points, but due to a small sample size (N = 4), these data should be viewed as preliminary. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that passive warm-up performed before eccentric exercise may be more beneficial than active warm-up or no warm-up in attenuating swelling but does not prevent, attenuate, or resolve more quickly the other clinical symptoms of eccentric muscle damage as produced in this study.

AB  - Objective: To examine the concept of dynamic ankle stability and closely critique the relevant research over the past 50+ years focusing on strength as it relates to those with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Data Sources: We reviewed the literature regarding the assessment of strength related to CAI. We searched MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science from 1950 through 2001 using the key words functional ankle instability, chronic ankle instability, strength, ankle stability, chronic ankle dysfunction, and isokinetics. Data Synthesis: An overview of dynamic stability in the ankle is established, followed by a comprehensive discussion involving the variables used to assess ankle strength. Additionally, a historical look at deficits in muscular stability leading to CAI is provided, and a compilation of numerous contemporary approaches examining strength as it relates to CAI is presented. Conclusions/Recommendations: Although strength is an important consideration during ankle rehabilitation, deficits in ankle strength are not highly correlated with CAI. More contemporary approaches involving the examination of reciprocal muscle-group ratios as a measure of strength have recently been investigated and offer an insightful, albeit different, avenue for future exploration. Evidence pertaining to the effects of strength training on those afflicted with CAI is lacking, including what, if any, implication strength training has on the various measures of ankle strength.

AB  - Strength training is used by all athletes, whatever their level. The principle is founded on knowledge of histochemical phenomena affecting the muscle fiber. Institution of strength training exercises requires a rigorous protocol defining the objects, the target muscles, the principles of action (endurance, force) and precaution (joint, muscle injury), type of exercises (anisometric, concentric, excentric, isokinetic), progression, tools used. Misuse which can leading to injury which can involve all of the locomotor elements (muscle, tendon, bone) must be prevented by careful physical examination before initiation. Strengthening training programs must be proposed by technicians well aware of the physiological principles, particularly muscular physiology: individual variability in response to strength training, age-related sarcopenia, joint risks, agonist-antagonist imbalance. © Masson, 2005.

AB  - A plasticizer separation system for aqueous enteric coating using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) was investigated. Optimum specifications of the concentric dual-feed spray nozzle and factors affecting the acid resistance of the coated tablets were evaluated. The separation of the plasticizer avoids the problem of nozzle blockage and results in coated tablets with excellent acid-resistance properties. Subsequent cleaning of the coating pan, tank and tubing was very easy.

AB  - The present review examines epidemiological evidence for a relation of left ventricular hypertrophy with coronary heart disease, and mechanisms that may represent pathophysiological links between left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary events. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been demonstrated to be a powerful predictor of coronary heart disease, and when geometry is concentric the relation is even stronger. In addition to its association with risk factors for atherosclerosis and mechanisms that precipitate acute heart attacks, left ventricular hypertrophy also directly predisposes to and aggravates clinical presentation of coronary heart disease through a number of biological mechanisms. These include the following: increase in oxygen requirement related to left ventricular geometry; coronary hypertension, with endothelial dysfunction and reduced coronary reserve; diastolic dysfunction; and structural remodelling of myocardium and vascular bed. Some of these alterations are also worsened by underlying coronary heart disease, and can potentially be maintained by loop mechanisms. A recognizable stage of abnormal coronary haemodynamics in the context of left ventricular hypertrophy is probably that at which coronary reserve is impaired in the absence of any other sign of heart disease; in many circumstances, this may occur early in the disease process. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - For top-tensioned riser analyses, the multi-tube modeling scheme is increasingly being used due to the growing application of the concentric dual casing riser systems. One of the major advantages of using the multi-tube modeling scheme over the conventional composite modeling scheme is the multi-tube model's capability to determine the size and locations of the inner riser centralizers, which are used to prevent the inner riser from buckling when the riser is in production, protect the inner riser and its couplings from rubbing the outer riser, and minimize the contact load between the outer and inner risers. This paper explains the methodology used to perform this unique analysis and introduces the concept of the stress increase factor that should be included in the riser strength check and fatigue life analyses. This paper also demonstrates that misplacing centralizers or improper spacing will increase the contact load at the two most critical regions of the riser system, the stress joint and keel joint, rather than decrease the contact load. Based on the analysis results, guidelines for designing and analyzing centralizers are developed.

AB  - The present study evaluated the relative effects of abiotic (weather: temperature, wind speed, and rain) and biotic (intra- and intertrophic density dependence: densities of conspecifics, prey per predator individual and leaves on plants) factors on the dispersal and on-plant activity (foraging and oviposition) of the predatory bug, Orius minutus, under seminatural field conditions. Experiments were conducted at plots, each comprising 25 potted azuki bean plants, placed symmetrically in concentric circles, in 1998 and 1999. At the central pot within each plot, 5 marked females of O, minutus (with a male in 1998) were released, and their location and activity were recorded hourly up to 24 h. A total of 78 individuals were released. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to select among weather, density dependence, and time variables. Hourly dispersal probability of individuals was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with time since release and with prey density per individual O. minutus. Hourly probability of individuals being active was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with number of leaves of visited plants and conspecific density per leaf. Between-year difference was observed in the probability of individuals being active, which was higher in 1998 than in 1999, probably generated by hunger and higher age. By contrast, diffusion rate was estimated to be lower in 1998, suggesting a trade-off between foraging/oviposition and dispersal by flight. The results indicate that dispersal is affected by temperature and intra-/intertrophic-level density dependence within and between trophic levels, as are foraging/oviposition. The importance of incorporating both abiotic and biotic factors should be stressed when modeling predator-prey metapopulation dynamics on a greenhouse scale.

AB  - A methodology is presented for optimization of the dynamic response of concentrically braced steel frames subjected to seismic excitation, based on the concept of uniform distribution of deformation. In order to obtain the optimum distribution of structural properties, an iterative optimization procedure has been adopted. In this approach, the structural properties are modified so that inefficient material is gradually shifted from strong to weak areas of a structure. This process is continued until a state of uniform deformation is achieved. It is shown that the seismic performance of such a structure is optimal, and behaves generally better than those designed by conventional methods. In order to avoid onerous analysis of the frame models, an equivalent procedure is introduced for performing the optimization procedure on the modified reduced shear-building model of the frames, which is shown to be accurate enough for design purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There are two main goals for the surgeon treating injuries around the elbow joint: the maintenance of a stable, concentric reduction of the joint and the initiation of early motion to help prevent stiffness and maximize functional outcome. The presence of a fracture decreases joint stability and increases the risk for early subluxation or dislocation with motion. Operative repair thus is indicated for most of these injuries to restore sufficient osseoligamentous support to allow safe, early motion and provide a stable functional elbow in the long term.

AB  - The signalling role of asymmetry has attracted considerable recent interest among evolutionary biologists. Although it has been studied primarily within the context of sexual selection, symmetry of signals may play a role also in inter-specific communication, such as predator-prey interactions. Both theory and experimental evidence suggest that asymmetry may impair the efficacy of visual warning signals used to deter potential predators, but increase the protective value of non-signalling, cryptic colour patterns used to decrease the risk of detection. Here we tested the prediction from this hypothesis by means of intra-individual comparisons of asymmetry in colour pattern elements in three species of moths (Arctia caja (L.), Noctua orbona (L.), Smerinthus ocellata (L.)) that possess cryptic fore wing patterns and signalling hind wing patterns. Mean asymmetries constituted 4.3% (range 2.1-7.0%) of trait size for colour pattern elements, whereas individual asymmetry levels reached as high as 26%. Asymmetry tended to be somewhat larger in cryptic patterns on fore wings than in signalling patterns on hind wings in five of six comparisons, but in only one case was the difference statistically significant. In addition, pattern elements were somewhat more asymmetric on fore wings also in Saturnia pavonia (L.), which possesses identical signalling eyespots on both fore and hind wings. The relatively low levels of asymmetry also in cryptic patterns imply either that selection does not favour increased asymmetry in cryptic patterns, or that the evolution of pronounced asymmetry is developmentally or genetically constrained.

AB  - Optical fibers are drawn from preforms (fused silica glass rods) typically made up of two concentric cylinders (the core rod and the clad tube), which are usually joined in a separate fusion process. The setup time and hence manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced if the two cylinders can be joined in the same furnace in which the fiber is drawn. A good understanding of the transient temperature distribution is needed for controlling the feed rate to avoid thermally induced cracks. Since direct measurement of the temperature fields is often impossible, the geometrical design of the preform and the control of the feed rate have largely been accomplished by trials-and-errors. The ability to predict the transient temperature distribution and the thermally induced stresses will provide a rational basis to design optimization and feed rate control of the process. In this paper, we present an analytical model to predict the transient conductive-radiative transfer as two partially joined, concentric glass cylinders with specular surfaces are fed into the furnace. Finite volume method (FVM) is used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The specular surface reflectivity is obtained by the Fresnel's law and the Snell's law. The boundary intensities are obtained through the coupling of the interior glass radiative transfer and the exterior furnace enclosure analysis. The model has been used to numerically study the transient conductive-radiative transfer in the advanced melting zone (AMZ) of an optic fiber drawing process. This problem is of both theoretical and practical interest in the manufacture of optical fibers. The computational method for the radiation transfer developed in this paper can also be applied to the simulation of the fiber drawing process and other glass-related manufacturing processes.

AB  - Observations were made of the reflective properties of the iridophore stripes of the squid Alloteuthis subulata and Loligo vulgaris, and the likely functions of these stripes are considered in terms of concealment and signalling. In both species, the mantle muscle is almost transparent. Stripes of iridophores run along the length of each side of the mantle, some of which, when viewed at normal incidence in white light, reflect red, others green or blue. When viewed obliquely, the wavebands best reflected move towards the blue/ultraviolet end of the spectrum and their reflections are almost 100% polarised. These are properties of quarter-wavelength stacks of chitin and cytoplasm, predicted in theoretical analyses made by Sir A. F. Huxley and Professor M. F. Land. The reflecting surfaces of the individual iridophores are almost flat and, in a given stripe, these surfaces are within a few degrees of being parallel. Both species of squid have conspicuous, brightly coloured reflectors above their eyes. These 'eyespots' have iridescent layers similar to those found on the mantle but are overlaid by a green fluorescent layer that does not change colour or become polarised as it is viewed more obliquely. In the sea, all reflections from the iridophore stripes will be largely confined to the blue-green parts of the spectrum and all reflections in other wavebands, such as those in the red and near ultraviolet, will be weak. The functions of the iridophores reflecting red at normal incidence must be sought in their reflections of blue-green at oblique angles of incidence. These squid rely for their camouflage mainly on their transparency, and the ventral iridophores and the red, green and blue reflective stripes must be used mainly for signalling. The reflectivities of some of these stripes are relatively low, allowing a large fraction of the incident light to be transmitted into the mantle cavity. Despite their low reflectivities, the stripes are very conspicuous when viewed from some limited directions because they reflect light from directions for which the radiances are much higher than those of the backgrounds against which they are viewed. The reflective patterns seen, for example, by neighbouring squid when schooling depend on the orientation of the squid in the external light field and the position of the squid relative to these neighbours.

AB  - There is growing evidence that isokinetic muscle strength, is one of the most common testing method why muscle strength is thought to be a major factor in athletic success and rehabilitation. A lot of publications during the last 20 years concerned the peak torque, the concentric ratio flexor/extensor, with comparison between males and females, sport specialities, young and old people. Isokinetic is also used for evaluation of knee disorders. The results are very useful after knee ligament surgery, less for femoro-patellar disorders and arthrosis. More recently some authors proposed the functional concept (eccentric flexors/concentric extensors ratio) as a predictive method for preventive muscle injuries or ACL lesions. They demonstrated more discomfort after muscle disorders with isokinetic eccentric testing, and proposed rehabilitation programs for prevention. However apart from a few situations, isokinetic testing does not fully predict functional measurements. It must be used with other techniques of evaluation (clinical methods and imagery). © 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservés.

AB  - A dual-membrane gas trap is currently used to remove non-condensed gases (NCG) from the Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) coolant on board the International Space Station. The gas trap consists of concentric tube membrane pairs, comprised of outer hydrophilic tubes and inner hydrophobic fibers. Liquid coolant passes through the outer hydrophilic membrane, which traps the NCG. The inner hydrophobic fiber allows the trapped NCG to pass through and vent to the ambient atmosphere in the cabin. The purpose of the gas trap is to prevent gas bubbles from causing depriming, overspeed, and shutdown of the ITCS pump, and the current gas trap has performed flawlessly in this regard. However, because of actual operational conditions on-orbit, its gas removal performance and operational lifetime have been affected. This paper discusses experiences with several of these dual-membrane gas traps, including on-orbit gas venting rate, effects due to the presence of nickel in the ITCS coolant, and subsequent refurbishing to remove the nickel from the gas trap.

AB  - The late Albian (Early Cretaceous) lineage of Actinoceramus sulcatus (Parkinson 1819) is a remarkble example of macro- and microevolution within the Bivalvia. Immediately following cladogenesis from ancestral A. concentricus, the lineage displays a conspicuous, short-term excursion through morphospace followed by a return to the ancestral form. This excursion is marked by the acquisition, and subsequent loss, of large radial folds affecting some part or all of the shell. The pattern is noteworthy because of the gross scale and rate of morphological evolution, the relatively short life span of an "extreme" morphology, an apparent evolutionary reversal, the presence of phenotypic clines through time, the extent of phenotypic variation within populations and abundance of morphological intermediates between disparate end-member types, the wide geographic distributions of phenotypic clines and variants, and the subtle asymmetry of morphological transitions bounding the evolutionary excursion. From census and biometric analyses of stratigraphically constrained samples, we conclude that morphological change was not focused at speciation and the pattern of evolution does not conform to the classical paradigm of punctuated equilibrium. Instead, we infer that observed patterns are best explained by phyletic evolution, at widely varying rates, combined with ecophenotypic plasticity. Evolution targeted the potential to form radial folds; the expression of those in any individual was determined, in part at least, by environmental cues. Ecophenotypic plasticity in A. sulcatus was itself probably an evolutionary response favored by the presence of long-lived planktotrophic larvae and wide dispersal of the species. In A. sulcatus, there is a continuum of pattern between intrapopulational, ecophenotypic variation that can be observed on bedding planes, interregional variation, and phyletic change through time. We argue that this continuity of pattern is most easily explained by continuity of process: in the case of the visually striking radial folds in A. sulcatus, there is no reason to invoke distinct hierarchies of macro- and microevolution; instead, these seem to be parts of a continuum. © 2005 The Paleontological Society.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the role of muscular strength and imbalance as predisposing factors in the development of anterior knee pain syndrome (AKPS). Methods: 96 male military recruits without history of knee pain volunteered for the study. Each volunteer underwent an isokinetic test prior to the start of a strenuous training program (approximately 8 to 12 hours/day for 6 weeks). The isokinetic test consisted of concentric contractions of the knee flexors and extensors at 60°/s and 240°/s. A detailed history and clinical examination of the patellofemoral joint was performed on each recruit. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare the isokinetic muscle parameters in recruits who developed AKPS during the training (pathological group) and in those who did not (control group). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to define the predictive outcome of anthropometrics and the isokinetic parameters for the development of AKPS. Results: 31 recruits developed AKPS. Absolute and bodyweight normalized peak extensor torque at 60°/s was significantly lower in the pathological group in comparison to the control group. Significant lower peak torque/BMI (Body Mass Index) were also indicated at both velocities. Recruits who developed AKPS had a shorter stature. No regression model could be set up to give any predictive value to the analyzed parameters. Conclusions: Recruits with shorter stature and lower quadriceps strength are more prone to develop AKPS during BMT. However, as the etiology of AKPS is multifactorial these parameters alone may not suffice to predict the occurrence of this pathology. On the other hand, the results of this study emphasize the importance of the reinforcement of quadriceps strength in the treatment and prevention of AKPS.

AB  - Adenosine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms by activating A1 adenosine receptors, probably by inhibiting excitatory amino acid release. Since blockade of A2A adenosine receptors seems to enhance dopaminergic striatopallidal transmission, we evaluated the role of the purinergic system in the opiate withdrawal syndrome by using two A1 receptor agonists [N6-cyclohexyladenosine, CHA and 2-chloro-N 6-cyclopentyladenosine, CCPA], and two A2A receptor antagonists (SCH 58261 and 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine, CSC). Male adult rats received increasing doses of morphine sulphate suspended in 5 ml/kg of a sustained release preparation (40-100 mg/kg s.c.) daily for 4 days and 20 h after the last administration, the withdrawal syndrome was evoked by naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.). Animals were observed for 30 min for signs of opiate withdrawal. Other groups of rats were implanted with concentric probes for microdialysis and dopamine levels were measured in the nucleus accumbens. CHA and CCPA (0.05, 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced "wet-dog" shakes, diarrhoea, teeth chattering, jumping and writhing. SCH 58261 and CSC (0.1, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg i.p.), given 10 min before naloxone, also reduced signs of opiate withdrawal. CHA plus SCH 58261 and CCPA plus CSC greatly enhanced the reduction of withdrawal signs observed with CHA and CCPA or CSC and SCH 58261 alone. In vivo microdialysis showed that naloxone significantly decreased DA release; this effect was prevented by pretreatment with systemic SCH 58261 and CSC, but not with CHA and CCPA. Our results demonstrate that A1 and A 2A adenosine receptors mediate the effect induced by adenosine in opiate withdrawal syndrome and suggest that adenosine A1 agonists and adenosine A2A antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of this syndrome.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major factor limiting long-term survival after cardiac transplantation. CAV is an accelerated form of coronary artery disease (CAD) that is characterized by concentric fibrous intimal hyperplasia along the length of coronary vessels. Both immunologic and non-immunologic risk factors contribute to the development of CAV by causing endothelial dysfunction and injury eventually leading to progressive intimal thickening. The diagnosis of CAV remains a challenge as angiography, the standard method for detecting focal plaques, lacks sensitivity in detecting CAV, and intravascular ultrasonography, a more sensitive method, lacks the ability to evaluate the entire coronary tree. The disease is difficult to treat and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Since treatment of CAV is limited and usually involves repeat transplantation, prevention or mitigation of immunologic and nonimmunologic risk factors is critically important. CAV prevention may involve therapy that provides protection against endothelial injury implemented just before transplantation, during storage and transplantation as well as after transplantation. This review addresses the frequency of occurrence, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of CAV, highlighting areas of active research. © 2005 CMA Media Inc.

AB  - Both local and regional habitat characteristics influence species richness and community structure. The scale at which communities are studied, however, affects the detection of relationships between habitat characteristics and patterns of habitat selection, species diversity, and species composition, and may obscure observation of differences in how species perceive the scale of environmental variation. To determine how environmental variation at different scales is related to species occurrence and richness, I analyze mist net sampling data on several guilds of forest understory birds. Bird capture, vegetation, and physical environment data come from 23 0.5-ha study sites in primary and secondary forest in Amazonian Ecuador. The percentages of primary forest within concentric circles around each site form forest imbeddedness measures (FIMs), which are evaluated using satellite imagery. Variation in FIM size represents different measurement scales for determining forest cover. Primary forest cover is also analyzed in successively larger tori surrounding sites and is used, after variable reduction with Principal Components Analysis, to summarize variation in forest cover around sites. Linear regression, surface trend analysis, and ordination help to quantify how variation in guild composition and species richness is explained by forest cover, vegetation structure, and physical environment. Species composition is related to variation in primary forest cover, primarily within 200-600 m of study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates that nectarivores, shrub-layer frugivores, and ant-following birds are captured in areas with relatively low primary forest cover. In contrast, shrub-layer insectivores, shrub-layer omnivores, and birds probing dead foliage for large insects tend to be captured in areas of relatively high primary forest cover. The species richness of insect gleaners, ant followers, and omnivores is statistically related to the percent cover of primary forest within hundreds of meters from the study sites. This suggests that some mechanisms that influence guild composition act over substantial distances. Nonetheless, the small radii of FIMs related to the species richness of dead-leaf probers suggests that local conditions and variation in forest cover over short (<200 m) distances directly or indirectly influence species richness of some primary forest birds. The significant relationship between temperature variation among capture sites and species richness of ant-following birds suggests that these species choose among habitats in a temperature range at which physiological constraints operate, either directly on the birds themselves or on the ants they follow. Species richness within the nectarivores, in contrast, shows no relationship with large-scale variation in primary forest cover. The radius of the FIM most closely associated with species richness differs among guilds, which suggests variation in the scale at which forest cover is associated with guild structure, as well as variation in the strength of the association. Differences in the scale of relationships between environment and species richness among guilds suggest that the mechanisms that influence both species' habitat use and community structure differ among guilds. A single mechanism, operating at a single scale, is inconsistent with these patterns. Independent data from eight additional sites suggest that prediction of species richness from surrounding forest structure could be useful for managing human impacts on tropical avian communities.

AB  - Many butterfly species feature two or four conspicuously coloured eyespots on their wings; the most commonly heard explanation for these markings is that they are used to intimidate predators. However, this explanation has stood, until recently, on the flimsiest of empirical foundations. Now, Adrian Vallin and colleagues have demonstrated empirically the effectiveness of these signals in dissuading avian predators from attacking the bearers. Their work suggests that predators can be intimidated by bold displaying by otherwise defenceless prey, and opens up an interesting challenge to evolutionary ecologists to explain how this apparently maladaptive behaviour is retained in predator populations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tetrasporogenesis in Osmundea spectabilis (Postels and Ruprecht) K.W. Nam var. spectabilis proceeds through three developmental stages. A uninucleate tetraspore mother cell with synaptonemal complexes depicted during early prophase of meiosis I comprises the youngest stage. Subsequently, the nuclear envelope obtains a highly irregular profile and is surrounded by perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and numerous mitochondria. Proplastids with peripheral thylakoid and numerous straight-profiled dictyosomes are present. Dictyosome vesicles discharge their contents, initiating tetraspore wall formation. A four-nucleate tetraspore mother cell is formed prior to tetrahedral cleavage. During the second stage of tetraspore formation the nuclei are very irregular in outline and move toward the central region where they fuse. The formation of fibrous vacuoles originates from the fibrous vacuole associated organelles (FVAOs). Thylakoid formation from concentric lamellar bodies (CLBs) seems to occur in plastids. Extremely hypertrophied dictyosomes with two tightly compressed and densely laminated mid-regions produce vesicles which contribute to enlargement of the fibrous vacuoles. During the second stage of tetraspore development striated vesicles are formed and starch granule formation increases. Mature tetraspores are characterized by numerous cored vesicles and abundant starch granules. Plastids have a fully developed system of internal thylakoids, and cleavage is usually complete at this stage. Mature tetraspores are surrounded by a bi-layered wall and the tetrasporangial wall. Unbranched, tubular structures connecting the plasmalemma with the peripheral sheets of ER are possibly involved in wall deformation. A distinct blebbing nuclear envelope appears to sequester vesicles into the cytoplasm.

AB  - Examples of adaptive radiation by Darwinian evolution will always enthral, and the theory of natural selection binds the whole of biology. But is selection all-powerful? Evolutionary developmental biology is beginning to provide the background to understanding how the internal organisation of organisms can influence the tempo and direction of evolutionary change. Do the mechanisms that generate the phenotype channel, bias or limit morphological evolution? The formation of eyespots on the wings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana is a process which is becoming comparatively well understood from the genetical, developmental and ecological perspectives. We have begun to combine this knowledge with artificial selection experiments to examine the rates at which morphological changes of a particular eyespot pattern in different directions can be achieved. Our initial selection experiment performed over twenty-five generations has shown that in contrast to predictions based on shared genetical and developmental properties, two butterfly eyespots on the same wing surface can be freely uncoupled from each other with respect to their pattern of relative sizes. This flexibility in development and in response to selection may occur because our base population is part of a lineage with a long legacy of natural selection building up genetic variation that enables independent behaviour for eyespot size, and thus it no longer reflects a tightly modular organisation of eyespots as may well have existed close to their evolutionary origin in basal Lepidoptera. Comparisons can be made between such descriptions of the potential for short-term changes in morphology in B. anynana and observed patterns of divergence among all extant species in this species-rich genus. Being able to map phenotypes onto genotypes via developmental processes provides a powerful basis for exploring genetical and developmental constraints. This will eventually lead to examples of evolutionary constraints that represent more than 'just-so' stories, and thus to a more balanced view of Darwinian evolution.

AB  - Theory about the role of constraints in evolution is abundant, but few empirical data exist to describe the consequences a bias in phenotypic variation has for micro evolution. Responses to natural selection can be severely hampered by a genetic correlation among a suite of traits. Constraints can be studied using antagonistic selection experiments, that is, two-trait selection in opposition to this correlation. The two traits studied here were development time and wing pattern (eyespot size) in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, both of which have a clear adaptive significance. Rates of response were higher for eyespot size than for development time, but were independent of the concurrent selection (either in the same direction as the correlation or perpendicular to it). Regimes differed in both traits in all directions after 11 generations of selection. The uncoupling lines had higher relative responses than the synergistic lines in development time and equal relative responses in eyespot size. The patterns for eyespot size (reaction norms) were consistent across different rearing temperatures. Differences in lines selected for fast and slow development time were more pronounced at lower temperatures, irrespective of the direction of joint wing pattern selection. Furthermore, correlated responses in pupal weight and growth rate were observed; lines selected for a slower development had higher pupal weights, especially at lower temperatures. The response of the uncoupling lines was not hampered by a lack of selectable genetic variation, and the relative response in the development time was larger than expected based on response in the coupled direction and quantitative genetic predictions. This suggests that the structure of the genetic architecture does not constrain the short-term, independent evolution of both wing pattern and development time.

AB  - The ability to gather information and assess risks in novel environments is crucial for survival and fitness in the wild. Our aim was to characterise behavioural strategies of exploration and risk assessment in novel environments and to investigate in what respects wild house mice differ from domesticated mice. A total of 39 adult male mice from three genetic backgrounds (Wild, BALB/c, and C57BL/6) were tested in three behavioural tests, the concentric square field (CSF), a modified open field (OF), and a conventional elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to spatial measures, behavioural measures of exploration and risk assessment were registered. The parameters were categorised according to their relevance to activity, exploration, approach-avoidance, and use of open areas/shelter. Wild mice had lower activity and a higher avoidance of open areas than the laboratory strains. No differences were found in exploratory motivation. The BALB/c mice avoided risk areas and showed high risk assessment (SAP), whereas C57BL/6 mice were more explorative and risk taking and showed little risk assessment. Wild mice seemed to have a different behavioural strategy of risk assessment in being more cautious before entering a potentially dangerous zone but explored all zones after assessed as nonrisky. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the animals' behaviour in the CSF arena supported these findings by clearly separating the three strains on the basis of their behavioural performances. It is concluded that there are obvious differences in behavioural strategies related to risk assessment and risk taking among wild mice versus domesticated house mice and also among laboratory strains. The relationship between the animal's risk concern and adaptability is discussed and should be a matter of importance considering animal welfare as well as the experimental aim and protocol. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mobility, activity patterns, habitat use, and some morphological traits of two often cooccurring satyrine butterflies of grasslands - the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) and the hedge brown (Pyronia tithonus) - were studied by a mark-release-recapture method at two sites. Additionally, some flight-related morphological traits of a series of collected females of P. tithonus were compared between recently colonized and permanent populations. The more active, but less mobile P. tithonus got faster wing damage than did M. jurtina and had more, and more symmetrically spread eyespots on the wings. For both species, the microdistribution was affected by shelter, long vegetation, and nectar, but this was more pronounced in P. tithonus. It is hypothesized that P. tithonus may traverse the same landscape at a slower rate than M. jurtina.

AB  - A new continuous fibre separator that that relies more on fibre-metal physical interaction than hydrodynamic flow is presented. It employs the principle of fibre stapling as the key separating mechanism. Several flat, thin, doughnut-shaped, concentric discs replace the conventional screen basket and the fibre suspension is jetted through air from twin 'butterfly' injectors mounted on a central rotating feed shaft to the disc edges. Longer fibres have a greater probability to impact the edges and staple and brush doctors attached to the feeder-ejectors remove them to the accepts tank. Shorter fibres and fines tend to pass between the separated discs and collected separately. The suspension flux clears the slots. Data are presented for a wide range of softwood fibres, fibre concentrations, and feed rates, over a range of feeder rotational speeds. There is a marked retention of the long fibres caused by stapling and a distinct shift in the fibre length distributions, fibre coarseness levels, and freeness values of the retained fibres. The passing fractions have increased fines with respect to the feed composition, an increased number of smaller length fibres, and a marked reduction in the quantity of long fibres. The differences in fibre qualities for single-pass fractions can be greater than for conventional pressure screening showing that this new method has potential for selective fibre fractionation. The best separation of a pine Kraft pulp (feed; mean length 2.43mm, coarseness 0.241mg/m) was for a mean length difference of 0.59mm (2.08 to 2.67mm difference), and a mean coarseness difference of 0.289mg/m (0.174 to 0.463mg/m) in these set of experiments.

AB  - Modularity in animal development is thought to have facilitated morphological diversification, but independent change of those traits integrated within a module might be restricted. Correlations among traits describe potential developmental constraints on evolution. These have often been postulated to explain patterns of morphological variation and have been examined theoretically but seldom analyzed experimentally. Here, we use artificial selection to explore the modular organization of butterfly wing patterns and the extent to which their evolution is constrained by the genetic correlations among repeated pattern elements. We show that, in Bicyclus anynana butterflies, despite the evidence that all eyespots are developmentally coupled, the response to selection for increased size of one individual eyespot can proceed in a manner largely independent from selection imposed on another eyespot. We argue that among-eyespot correlations are unlikely to have constrained the evolutionary diversification of butterfly wing patterns but might be important when only limited time is available for adaptive evolution to occur. The ease with which we have been able to produce independent responses to artificial selection on different eyespots may be linked to a legacy of natural selection favoring individuality. Our results are discussed within the context of the evolution of modularity and individuality of serially repeated morphological traits.

AB  - An unusual specimen of Aglais urticae, lacking characteristic UV-reflecting parafocal eyespot elements along the margins of both fore and hind wings, is compared with normal, wild-type specimens. Wing scales, responsible for generating structural coloration, are missing in the abnormal individual and have been replaced with a type that is typical of pigment-based colours. Other modifications seen in the abnormal specimen include firstly, a distal expansion of a uniformly brown region, that otherwise occupies a proximal position on the hind wings of the wild type, and secondly, the lack of a characteristic orange cross-vein band that runs proximal to the parafocal eyespot elements on the hind wing. The differences in coloration between abnormal and wild type are seen as evidence of a proximal-distal developmental axis (originally proposed by Nijhout 1991) and support a view recently aired by Beldade and Brakefield (2003). It is now clear that studies on butterfly eyespot development must consider not only pigment-containing scales, but also the structurally modified scales responsible for physical colours, i.e. UV reflectivity.

AB  - "With a wedding impending, the Taiwanese bride-to-be turns to bridal photographers, makeup artists, and hair stylists to transform her image beyond recognition. They give her fairer skin, eyes like a Western baby doll, and gowns inspired by sources from Victorian England to MTV. An absorbing consideration of contemporary bridal practices in Taiwan, Framing the Bride shows how the lavish photographs represent more than mere conspicuous consumption. They are artifacts infused with cultural meaning and emotional significance, products of the gender- and generation-based conflicts in Taiwan's hybrid system of modern matrimony. From the bridal photographs, the book opens out into broader issues such as courtship, marriage, kinship, globalization, and the meaning of the ""West"" and ""Western"" cultural images of beauty. Bonnie Adrian argues that in compiling enormous bridal albums full of photographs of brides and grooms in varieties of finery, posed in different places, and exuding romance, Taiwanese brides engage in a new rite of passage-one that challenges the terms of marriage set out in conventional wedding rites. In Framing the Bride, we see how this practice is also a creative response to U.S. domination of transnational visual imagery-how bridal photographers and their subjects take the project of globalization into their own hands, defining its terms for their lives even as they expose the emptiness of its images." © 2003 by the Regents of the University of California.

AB  - Developing organisms are thought to be modular in organization so that traits in different modules evolve independently whereas traits within a module change in a concerted manner. The eyespot pattern in Bicyclus anynana butterflies provides an ideal system where morphological modularity can be dissected and different levels of genetic integration analyzed. Several lines of evidence show that all eyespots in an individual butterfly are genetically integrated, suggesting that the whole pattern, rather than the separate eyespots, should be considered as a single character. However, despite the strong genetic correlations between the two eyespots on the dorsal forewing of B. anynana, there is great potential for independent changes. Here we use laboratory lines selected in different directions for the size of those eyespots to study correlated responses in the whole eyespot pattern. We show clear changes in eyespot size across all wing surfaces, which depend on eyespot position along the anterior-posterior axis. There are also changes in the number of extra eyespots and in eyespot color composition but no changes in eyespot position relative to wing margin. Our analysis of eyespot pattern modularity is discussed in the light of what is known about the cellular and genetic mechanisms of eyespot formation and the great potential for evolutionary diversification in butterfly wing patterns.

AB  - Delayed-onset muscle soreness refers to the skeletal muscle pain that is experienced following eccentric exercise. The aim of the present study was to examine the physiological effects of physical activity with or without ibuprofen on delayed onset muscle soreness. Forty-four non-athletic male volunteers (age 24.3 ± 2.4 years) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: physical activity (n = 11), ibuprofen (n = 11), physical activity and ibuprofen (combination, n = 11), or control (n = 11). The physical activity programme comprised 5 min of walking and jogging, 10 min of static stretching of the hands and shoulder girdle, and 5 min of concentric movements with sub-maximal contractions. The total amount of ibuprofen consumed by a single individual was 2800 mg; this was taken from 1 h before the eccentric actions up to 48 h after it. Delayed onset muscle soreness was induced by performing 70 eccentric contractions of the biceps muscle of the nondominant side on a modified arm curl machine. Perceived muscle soreness, maximal eccentric contraction, creatine kinase enzyme activity and elbow range of motion were assessed 1 h before and 1, 24 and 48 h after the eccentric actions. The results indicated that, after the eccentric actions, soreness increased (P < 0.001) across time in all groups, with the highest values being recorded at 24 h. At 24 and 48 h, greater soreness (P < 0.001) was observed in the control group than in the physical activity and combination groups. After the eccentric actions, creatine kinase increased and was elevated (P < 0.001) compared with baseline in all groups, with values returning to baseline in the physical activity and combination groups by 48 h. However, creatine kinase in the control and ibuprofen groups was still significantly higher than at baseline after 48 h. Creatine kinase was higher (P < 0.001) in the control group than in physical activity and combination groups at 24 and 48 h. There was also a reduction (P < 0.001) in elbow range of motion across time. This reduction in elbow range of motion was greater (P < 0.001) in the control and ibuprofen groups than in the physical activity and combination groups at 1, 24 and 48 h. The reduction in maximum eccentric contraction was greater (P < 0.001) in the control and ibuprofen groups than in the physical activity group at 24 and 48 h and the combination group at 48 h. In conclusion, the results add to our understanding of the effects of physical activity and the combination of physical activity and ibuprofen in reducing the severity of muscle soreness induced by eccentric exercise. Physical activity conducted before eccentric exercise alleviates muscle soreness. Our results indicate that physical activity with or without ibuprofen helps to prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - Chemistry control is important for the helium coolant of High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) because impurities cause oxidation of the graphite used in the core and corrosion of high temperature materials used in the heat exchanger. In the High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) which is the first HTGR in Japan, the chemical impurity concentration is restricted and its behaviour is monitored during reactor operations. The impurity is reduced by the helium purification system and the concentration is measured by the helium sampling system installed to the primary and secondary helium system, continuously. This paper describes the impurity behaviour during the rise-to-power test which is the initial power-up of the HTTR. Also, the amount of the emitted impurity to the primary circuit from the graphite component and insulator used at the concentric hot gas duct are evaluated. During the power up, any abnormal impurity increases were not obtained and the chemical composition of the primary circuit was sufficiently in the stability area to avoid carbon deposition.

AB  - In the Western Cape province of South Africa, eyespot disease (Tapesia yallundae) of wheat is primarily controlled by fungicide applications. Previous studies have shown, however, that isolates of T. yallundae vary in their response to fungicides. In the present study, 20 isolates from each of 15 fields with different fungicide histories were screened against carbendazim at 1 μg/ml; propiconazole, tebuconazole and flutriafol each at 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 μg/ml; and flusilazole and bromuconazole each at 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 μg/ml. No isolates were resistant to carbendazim. Flusilazole proved to be most effective of all the triazole fungicides tested. Based on the analysis of EC50 values compared to that of a field at Gouda that is at baseline sensitivity, shifts in sensitivity were detected to all triazoles. This suggests that measures for prevention of build-up of resistance need to be employed. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The topologically segregated bilayer-bead concept has been applied to encoded "one-bead one-compound" (OBOC) combinatorial libraries to avoid the interference of coding tags with biological screening. In this paper, we report on the development of a novel partial Alloc-deprotection (PAD) approach and the use of this approach to establish a new ladder-synthesis method for OBOC combinatorial libraries to further exploit the concept. In the PAD approach, Alloc-protected beads are partially deprotected, sequentially layer by layer, starting from the outer layer toward the bead interior. The degree of deprotection (or thickness of each layer) is controlled by the time of exposure to the deprotecting agent, palladium. By repetitive use of the PAD approach, a small portion of Alloc-protected N termini in the bead interior is liberated in each synthetic cycle for generation of an additional ladder member such that each library bead will carry a full-length library compound on the bead surface and a series of truncated ladder members in the bead interior. For the libraries containing isobaric residues, a simple encoding strategy is introduced in the ladder-synthesis method so that the isobaric residues can be differentiated by the coding tags. One advantage of this encoding strategy is that the coding tags are confined together with the truncated ladder members in the bead interior, thus maintaining the arrangement that only the library compounds are displayed on the bead surface. The PAD approach of forming multiple concentric functional layers inside a bead is simple, reliable, and may have other applications in addition to OBOC combinatorial library bead encoding, such as the development of novel optically encoded beads for multiplex immunodiagnostics or even information recording. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background. Although shoulder arthroplasty is an accepted treatment for osteoarthritis, loosening of the glenoid component, which mainly occurs at the bone-cement interface, remains a major concern. Presently, the mechanical effect of the cement mantel thickness on the bone-cement interface is still unclear. Methods. Finite element analysis of a prosthetic scapula was used to evaluate the effect of cement thickness on stresses and micromotions at the bone-cement interface. The glenoid component was all-polyethylene, keeled and flat back. Cement mantel thickness was gradually increased from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. Two glenohumeral contact forces were applied: concentric and eccentric. Two extreme cases were considered for the bone-cement interface: bonded and debonded. Findings. Within cement, stress increased as cement thickness decreased, reaching the fatigue limit below 1.0 mm. Bone stress was below its ultimate strength and was minimum between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. Interface stress was close to the interface strength, and also minimum between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. Both the decentring of the load and the debonding of the interface increased the stress. Interpretation. A cement thinning weakens the cement, but also the bone-cement interface, along the back-keel edges. Conversely, a cement thickening rigidifies the cemented implant, consequently increasing interfacial stresses and micromotions. To avoid both excessive cement fatigue and interface failure, an ideal cement thickness has been identified between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given that they represent the most economical option for disposing of refuse, waste landfills are widespread in urban areas. However, landfills generate air and water pollution and require restoration for landscape development. A number of unsanitary waste landfills have caused severe environmental problems in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the colonization status of different tree species on waste landfills to assess their potential for restoring unsanitary landfills in South Korea. Plot surveys were conducted using 10 × 10-m quadrats at seven waste landfill sites: Bunsuri, Dugiri, Hasanundong, Gomaeri, Kyongseodong, Mojeonri, and Shindaedong. We determined the height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and number of tree species in the plots, and enumerated all saplings ≤ 1 m high. Because black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia, was the dominant tree species in the waste landfills, we measured the distance from the presumed mother plant (i.e., the tallest black locust in a patch), height, and DBH of all individuals in black locust patches to determine patch structure. Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix koreensis, and Populus sieboldii formed canopy layers in the waste landfills. The basal area of black locust was 1.51 m2/ha, and this species had the highest number of saplings among all tree species. The diameter of the black locust patches ranged from 3.71 to 11.29 m. As the patch diameter increased, the number of regenerated saplings also tended to increase, albeit not significantly. Black locust invaded via bud banks and spread clonally in a concentric pattern across the landfills. This species grew well in the dry habitat of the landfills, and its growth rate was very high. Furthermore, black locust has the ability to fix nitrogen symbiotically; it is therefore considered a well-adapted species for waste landfills. Eleven woody species were selected for screening: Acer palmatum, Albizzia julibrissin, Buxus microphylla var. koreana, Ginkgo biloba, Hibiscus syriacus, Koelreuteria paniculata, Ligustrum obtusifolium, Liriodendron tulipifera, Pinus koraiensis, Pinus thunbergii, and Sophora japonica. As a result of a comparison of the total ratio (sum of shoot extension and diameter growth at the landfill relative to a reference site) and mortality, six species (Liriodendron tulipifera, Albizzia julibrissin, Ligustrum obtusifolium, Buxus microphylla var. koreana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Sophora japonica), which had a total ratio >1 and experienced low mortality, are recommended as potentially suitable species for waste landfill remediation. We suggest that mixed plantations of ubiquitous adaptable species and naturally occurring black locust will enhance the landscape through synergistic effects. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Selection for crypsis in varying environments has long been established as the main evolutionary force promoting the huge variation in avian egg coloration. In several avian species, variation in egg coloration exists, but available information available on the relative success of these different colour morphs against predation is scarce. We investigated the value of eggshell coloration against mammal and avian predators in the South American Tern, Sterna hirundinacea. We found evidence of a relationship between particular eggshell ground coloration and success against predation, in different tern colonies, where strong selection was caused by single avian and mammalian predator species. Survival to hatching of eggs with greenish ground coloration was greater than in eggs of the remaining colours when a mammalian carnivore was present. This implies that the human visual system does not accurately represent predator perception but that, viewed through the predator's eyes, the conspicuous greenish eggs are well concealed. The rate of artificial nest predation by visually searching gulls was higher for eggs more conspicuous to the human eye than for eggs more closely resembling the nest substrate. The evolution of polymorphisms in eggshell ground colour may have resulted from differences in the type of predator present, and differences in choice of breeding site varying in the background substrate. The nomadic breeding behaviour of terns may imply that females differing in the frequency of alleles expressing particular egg coloration, selected for in particular environments, may eventually gather in some colonies, thus producing the observed intracolony variation in egg coloration. We hypothesise that egg colour variation could be maintained in the population by shifting peaks of predation impact in the different locations where colonies form, e.g. islands without mammalian predators vs. mainland sites. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Specimens of a species of cyclocoelid digenean inhabiting Jacana spinosa from the Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica, most closely resemble Haematotrephus facioi (Brenes and Arroyo, 1962) Yamaguti, 1971, in the same host from Aranjuez, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, in having confluent vitelline follicles posteriorly, diagnostic of Neohaematotrophus, and in pharynx length, ovary width, and cirrus sac on the sinistral side. The new species is also highly similar in appearance to H. gendrei Dubois, 1959, also inhabiting a jacanid (from West Africa), which has vitelline follicles confluent posteriorly, and extending anteriorly to the intestinal bifurcation and genital pore opening immediately posterior to the anterior margin of the pharynx. Like H. facioi, H. gendrei has a relatively much shorter and broader cirrus sac than does the new species. Examination of the holotype and paratype of H. facioi confirmed that the specimens from Guanacaste differ in having a longer body, a larger ovary and eggs, and smaller testes. They also have the ovary on the sinistral rather than the dextral side of the body, genital pore anterior to the pharynx rather than at or posterior to the level of the posterior margin of the pharynx, longer and thinner cirrus sac, and eggs without eyespotted miracidia. Half the eggs in both specimens of H. facioi have well-developed eyespotted miracidia, whereas the typical condition for cyclocoelids is for virtually all eggs to exhibit eyespotted miracidia. Both H. facioi and H. gendrei are transferred to Neohaematotrophus, along with the new species.

AB  - A pneumatic gun for ballistic delivery of microparticles to soft targets is proposed and demonstrated. The particles are accelerated by a high-speed flow of helium in a capillary tube. Vacuum suction applied to a concentric larger diameter tube is used to divert substantially all of the flow of helium from the gun nozzle, thereby preventing the gas from hitting and damaging the target. Speed of ejection of micron-sized gold particles from the gun nozzle, and their depth of penetration into agarose gels are reported. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - In a genetic local search (GLS) which is a hybrid technique of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a local search (LS), the undesirable phenomenon of premature convergence can often occur. Premature convergence is the phenomenon where the diversity of a group is lost. This phenomenon occurs because identical individuals are increased rapidly in the group while searching. Therefore, crossover loses its function. Once the premature convergence occurs, the search by the GLS becomes meaningless. Therefore, it is important to avoid the premature convergence and maintain the diversity. We made the parallel GLS to improve its searching ability and, in this paper, we propose a method named “Islands' Distance Strategy” to improve the searching ability of the GLS by introducing the concept of distance between the islands on one-dimensional torus type island model and by limiting the islands’ range to which migrants can migrate. The problems used in these experiments are traveling salesman problems (TSPs) in 48 cities arranged in double-concentric-circle. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved 100.0% as the attainment rate to the optimal solution, where the number of islands (subpopulations) Nsp = 20, 25 and the islands' range to which migrants can migrate r =1, 2. Furthermore we demonstrated the existence of an appropriate islands' range to which migrants can migrate, and confirmed that the appropriate islands' range r = 2 in these experimental conditions. © 2005, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of physical water treatment (PWT) with a solenoid coil on the fouling prevention in a heat exchanger with cooling-tower water. Five different tests were conducted in a concentric-tube heat exchanger at 12 cycles of concentration: no-treatment, PWT only, PWT plus 10% filtration, PWT plus 40% filtration, and 10% filtration only. A small flow velocity of 0.83 m/s and a high heat flux of 22.5 × 104 W/m2 were chosen to accelerate the fouling in the heat exchanger. The fouling resistance in the case with PWT plus 40% filtration was approximately 78% less than that in the no-treatment case. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBF) have gained notable acceptance in Taiwan recently because of its excellent seismic performance and cost-effectiveness. Compare to the traditional concentric braces, buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) have a high compression strength similar to the tension yielding behavior. The gusset connections must be designed to prevent instabilities when transmit high compression forces of the BRBs. In this paper, experimental behavior of a buckled gusset connections in a full-scale 3-story 3-bay CFT/BRB frame specimen tested in the structural laboratory of NCREE is presented, theoretical study and finite element analysis of gusset connections are also described in this paper. In order to investigate the BRBF system subjected to the bi-directional earthquake loads, a full-scale 2-story single-bay BRBF specimen has been constructed for testing in March of 2005. In order to examine the effectiveness of various stiffening schemes for the gusset plate, results of the finite element analysis are presented. It’s illustrated from the gusset plate buckling analysis that proper stiffeners are effective to increase the buckling strength of the gusset plate. © 2005 EUCENTRE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is considered to provide a means of evaluating developmental stability and to reflect an individual's quality or the stress experienced during development. Stress is predicted to increase the phenotypic variation of both FA and trait size. In this study we examined the effect of a particular heat shock on both FA and size of eyespots in the butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. We also examined whether those eyespots thought to be involved in partner choice and sexual selection were particularly sensitive to stress. We applied a heat shock of 39.5°C for 3 h before, during, and after a sensitive period in eyespot development. We examined the FA, variation in FA, size, and variation in size of five eyespots, two on the dorsal forewing (sexually selected traits), two on the ventral forewing, and one on the ventral hindwing (nonsexually selected traits). For each sex and treatment, the heat shock did not result in significant changes in mean trait size and FA nor in the variation of size and FA. There were no differences in the response to the heat shock between sexually and nonsexually selected traits. We discuss how the increased production of heat shock proteins, including HSP60, may have stabilized development and how this might explain the results.

FA refers to the nondirectional variation between left and right sides, whereas directional asymmetry (DA) refers to a significant directional variation between the sides. We studied four eyespots on the dorsal forewing of the tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. Two of the eyespots were specified by a mutant allele, Spotty, that was fixed in the stock. These eyespots showed higher FA than the two flanking, wild-type eyespots, although they are all formed by the same developmental pathway. We applied artificial selection for lower FA of the novel eyespots in an attempt to increase their developmental stability. There was significant variation present in individual FA in our study. However, this did not change as a result of the artificial selection. Most of the variation in FA can be accounted for by individual differences in developmental stability rather than by the applied selection or by environmental variation. Thus, it was not possible to produce any increased developmental stability of the novel eyespots by selecting for low FA. The estimates of realized heritability for both FA and DA of each eyespot were not significantly different from zero. The results suggest that FA provides little, if any, potential for exploring the mechanistic basis of developmental stability.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana exhibits phenotypic plasticity involving the wet-season phenotype, which possesses marginal eyespots on the ventral surface of the wings, and the dry-season form, which lacks these eyespots. We examined the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity of B. anynana in relation to the defence mechanisms of crypsis and deflection. We assessed the visibility differences between spotless and spotted butterflies against backgrounds of brown (dry season) or green (wet season) leaves. Spotless butterflies were highly cryptic and less predated by adult bird predators than were spotted ones when presented against brown leaf litter. However, the advantage of crypsis disappeared in the wet-season habitat as both forms were equally visible. In later experiments, naive birds presented with resting butterflies in the wet-season habitat tended to learn more rapidly to capture spotless butterflies, suggesting a slight selective advantage of possessing eyespots. Moreover, marginal eyespots increased significantly the escape probability of butterflies that were attacked by naive birds compared to those attacked by adult birds, although there were no differences in prey capture success within naive predators. Our results show that natural selection acts against eyespots in the dry season, favouring crypsis, whereas in the wet season it may favour eyespots as deflective patterns.

AB  - Several recent experimental studies have provided strong evidence for the ability of birds to manipulate the sex ratio of their offspring prior to laying. Using a captive population of peafowl (Pavo cristatus), we tested experimentally the effects of paternal attractiveness on offspring sex ratio, and related sex ratio deviations to egg-yolk concentrations of testosterone, 17β-estradiol and corticosterone. When females were mated to males whose attractiveness had been experimentally reduced by removing prominent eyespot feathers from their trains, they produced significantly more female offspring, had significantly higher yolk corticosterone concentrations and tended to have lower levels of yolk testosterone than when mated to the same males with their full complement of feathers. Concentrations of 17β-estradiol did not vary consistently with sex ratio biases. These findings add to the small number of studies providing experimental evidence that female birds can control the primary sex ratio of their offspring in response to paternal attractiveness, and highlight the possibility that corticosterone and perhaps testosterone are involved in the sex manipulation process in birds. © 2005 The Royal Society.

AB  - An improved version of the constant volume sampling (CVS) methodology that overcomes a number of obstacles that exist with the current CVS dilution tunnel system used in most diesel and gasoline vehicle emissions test facilities is presented. The key feature of the new sampling system is the introduction of dilution air immediately at the vehicle tailpipe. In the present implementation, this is done concentrically through a cylindrical air filter. Elimination of the transfer hose conventionally used to connect the tailpipe to the dilution tunnel significantly reduces the hydrocarbon and particulate matter (PM) storage release artifacts that can lead to wildly incorrect particle number counts and to erroneous filter-collected PM mass. It provides accurate representations of particle size distributions for diesel vehicles by avoiding the particle coagulation that occurs in the transfer hose. Furthermore, it removes the variable delay time that otherwise exists between the time that emissions exit the tailpipe and when they are detected in the dilution tunnel. The performance of the improved CVS system is examined with respect to diesel, gasoline, and compressed natural gas vehicles. © 2003 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - The present study determined the effects of concentric and eccentric contractions on muscle function, injury, swelling/inflammation, and serum skeletal muscle troponin-I (sTnI), creatine kinase (CK), cortisol (CORT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Eight untrained males performed one exercise bout with each leg, separated by three weeks. One bout consisted of 7 sets of 10 repetitions of eccentric contractions of the knee extensors at 150% of the concentric 1-RM (ECC) while the other bout consisted of 7 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric contractions at 75% 1-RM (CON). The legs used and the bouts performed were randomized to prevent order effects. Five days prior to each exercise bout, baseline measurements were taken for muscle strength. Immediately prior to each bout, a venous blood sample and measurements of thigh circumference (CIRC), total body water (TBW), knee range of motion (ROM), and perceived muscle soreness (SORE) were obtained. At 6, 24, and 48 hr post-exercise, all aforementioned measurements and blood samples were obtained for both bouts. Data were analyzed with 2 X 4 repeated measures ANOVA (p<0.05). ECC produced greater muscle injury, evidenced by peak decreases of 30% in strength and increases of 307%, 228%, 66%, 78%, and 170%, respectively, for SORE, CK, sTnI, CORT, and IL-6 (p<0.05). However, the 5%, 6%, and 5% increases in CIRC, TBW, and ROM were not significant (p<0.05). For CON, respective peak decreases in strength and ROM of 12% and 2%, and increases of 3% and 3% for CIRC and TBW were not significant. However, the respective increases of 173%, 143%, 31%, 30%, and 56% for SORE, CK, sTnI, CORT, and IL-6 were significant (p<0.05). Our results suggest that eccentric contractions induce greater muscle injury than concentric contractions; however, the magnitude of muscle injury seems to be the primary mitigating factor for increasing serum IL-6 rather than muscle inflammation.

AB  - Sex ratios of the American snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina are female-biased at cool temperatures, male-biased at moderate temperatures, and only females are produced at warm temperatures. The laboratory incubation of eggs at several constant temperatures yields patterns of skewed sex ratios. In this study, incubated eggs represented regional samples of C. serpentina from six different latitudes. The sample from the highest latitude yielded male-biased sex ratios across the broadest range of cool temperatures. This male-biased zone and those of the other five samples collectively contributed to a nested arrangement that is approximately symmetrical around a temperature of 24.5°C. Two indices of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) patterns (MF pivotal temperature, width of the male-biased zone) were significantly associated with latitude and with published data on several climatic variables (e.g. sunshine and rainfall). At high latitudes, females nest in exposed locations, locally the warmest places. At low latitudes females place their nests in shaded locations. Such nest site selection renders high latitude nests warmer than low latitude nests, even if only intermittently. Given that constant conditions show faster embryogenesis in high vs low latitude eggs, exposed nest sites seem to be an additional adaptation to hasten embryogenesis in high latitude nests. At low latitudes, shading prevents nests from overheating. We propose that a trade-off between evolution, (1) to balance sex ratio and (2) to maintain male-biased sex ratios in a temperature range that favours male fitness, leads to the observed arrangement of concentric TSD patterns centred around male production at 24.5°C.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology has encouraged a change of research emphasis from the sorting of phenotypic variation by natural selection to the production of that variation through development. Some morphologies are more readily generated than others, and developmental mechanisms can limit or channel evolutionary change. Such biases determine how readily populations are able to respond to selection, and have been postulated to explain stasis in morphological evolution and unexplored morphologies. There has been much discussion about evolutionary constraints but empirical data testing them directly are sparse. The spectacular diversity in butterfly wing patterns is suggestive of how little constrained morphological evolution can be. However, for wing patterns involving serial repeats of the same element, developmental properties suggest that some directions of evolutionary change might be restricted. Here we show that despite the developmental coupling between different eyespots in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, there is great potential for independent changes. This flexibility is consistent with the diversity of wing patterns across species and argues for a dominant role of natural selection, rather than internal constraints, in shaping existing variation.

AB  - Petroleum Development Oman LLC is one of the leading oil companies in the Middle East with a long history of early utilization of new technology. The cumulative production from its fields to date runs into millions of barrels of oil, with production starting back in 1967. Drilling in PDO's mature fields using conventional drilling methods has become a challenge these days as severe reservoir impairment has been seen in Nimr and Saih Rawl fields. Much of this impairment is due to high overbalances resulting on the low reservoir pressures. Other problems were high water cut above that predicted from logging while drilling (LWD) evaluation. Underbalanced drilling (USD) was identified as a method of overcoming this problem. UBD trail wells have been drilled using 2 different UBD techniques (Concentric casing and Drill pipe gas injection). To date 18 UBD horizontal wells have been put onstream: 14 horizontal single lateral wells in the Nimr Field (12 new wells and 2 re-entries); and 4 horizontal multi lateral (total of 9 legs) UBD wells in the Saih Rawl Field. Significant productivity improvements have been observed, and valuable reservoir data has been gathered during the drilling of these wells. Drilling performance has also shown marked improvements. This paper is written to highlight the key learning points which have been captured and applied in the UBD campaigns.

AB  - Aim. Muscular strength is one of the most important components of sport, both for high performance and injury prevention. One of the most used methods to assess strength muscle balance between dominant (D)/non-dominant (ND) and antagonist/agonist is isokinetic testing. The main purpose of the present study was to describe and to compare isokinetic strength profiles (peak torque, bilateral strength differences between D/ND leg (BD) and hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio) in athletes of different sports and positional roles. Methods. Twenty-eight elite volleyball players and 47 pro soccer players (goalkeepers, n=5; full-backs, n=7; defenders, n=10; midfielders, n=15; forwards, n=10) were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex-System 2). Maximal gravity corrected concentric peak torque of knee extensor and flexor muscles were measured at angular velocities of 360°•s-1 (6.28 rad•s-1) and 90°•s-1 (1.57 rad•s -1). Results. No significant BD were found between soccer and volleyball players with exception of hamstrings at 90°•s-1 (soccer: 10.6±8.0% vs volleyball: 6.9±5.5%). The H/Q ratio was significantly lower in volleyball players at 90°•s-1 (D: soccer 57.4±6.7% vs volleyball 150.4±7.2% ND: soccer: 56.1±8.2% vs volleyball: 50.5±6.4%). No significant differences were found for BD and H/Q ratio in soccer players of different positional roles. Conclusion. In general, soccer and volleyball players do not seem to be different concerning BD although a significant difference was observed in hamstrings at 90°•s-1. Moreover, our data suggest that specific demands of these sports and the different positional roles in soccer did not induce bilateral leg imbalances. However, sport demands seem to influence isokinetic concentric H/Q ratio.

AB  - Loss of cells from the motor system occurs during the normal aging process, leading to reduction in the complement of motor neurons and muscle fibers. The latter age-related decrease in muscle mass has been termed "sarcopenia" and is often combined with the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle in older adults, leading to a significant reduction in reserve capacity of the neuromuscular system, which is the primary subject of this review. Clear evidence of this aging effect is seen when voluntary or stimulated muscle strength is compared across the adult lifespan, with a steady decline of ∼ 1-2% per year occurring after the sixth decade. Interestingly, when compared with isometric contractions, the effect of aging is more pronounced for concentric movements and less for eccentric movements (i.e., muscle shortening versus lengthening). This phenomenon appears to be linked to the stiffer muscle structures and prolonged myosin crossbridge cycles of aged muscles. It is encouraging that the capability of physiological adaptations in the motor pathways remains into very old age - when an appropriate exercise stimulus is given - and long-term prevention strategies are advocated to avoid excessive physical impairments and activity restrictions in this age group. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - L-NAME-induced hypertension has been shown to produce concentric (eutrophic) remodeling of the heart despite an enhanced afterload. We postulated that nitric oxide synthase inhibition could limit coronary capillary growth to explain the nature of remodeling. To test our hypothesis, we aimed at determining the effect of endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide on coronary neovascularization. Aortic and coronary rings from normotensive animals were incubated in a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix in the presence of L-NAME or the nitric oxide donor SNAP. L-NAME inhibited, while SNAP stimulated, neovascularization from aortic and coronary rings after 12 days of in vitro incubation. In arterial rings harvested from rats treated with L-NAME for 14 days and in which no further in vitro treatment was added, only coronary rings showed a reduction in new capillary generation. While confirming that chronic L-NAME-treated rats develop concentric remodeling, the evaluation of capillary density did not reveal any difference as compared with the controls in 3 areas of the myocardium. In conclusion, chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis in vivo produces a long-lasting reduction in the capacity of coronary arteries to generate new capillaries in vitro. Thus, our results lend support to the hypothesis that an inhibition of new capillary formation could prevent the development of compensatory ventricular hypertrophy, in favor of concentric remodeling.

AB  - A new approach to computing a panoramic (360 degrees) depth map is presented in this paper. Our approach uses a large collection of images taken by a camera whose motion has been constrained to planar concentric circles. We resample regular perspective images to produce a set of multiperspective panoramas and then compute depth maps directly from these resampled panoramas. Our panoramas sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial distance, and vertical elevation. The use of multiperspective panoramas eliminates the limited overlap present in the original input images and, thus, problems as in conventional multibaseline stereo can be avoided. Our approach differs from stereo matching of single-perspective panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints are sine curves. For our multiperspective panoramas, the epipolar geometry, to the first order approximation, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo algorithm can be applied to multiperspective panoramas with little modification. In this paper, we describe two reconstruction algorithms. The first is a cylinder sweep algorithm that uses a small number of resampled multiperspective panoramas to obtain dense 3D reconstruction. The second algorithm, in contrast, uses a large number of multiperspective panoramas and takes advantage of the approximate horizontal epipolar geometry inherent in multiperspective panoramas. It comprises a novel and efficient 1D multibaseline matching technique, followed by tensor voting to extract the depth surface. Experiments show that our algorithms are capable of producing comparable high quality depth maps which can be used for applications such as view interpolation.

AB  - The Lüneburg lens (LL) represents a very attractive candidate for many applications such as multibeam antennas, multifrequency scanning, and spatial scanning, due to its focusing properties. Indeed, it is a dielectric sphere on which each surface point is a frequency-independent perfect focusing point. This is produced by its index governing law n, which follows the radial distribution n2 = 2 - r2, where r is the normalized radial position. Practically, LL is manufactured as a finite number of concentric homogeneous dielectric shells - this is called a discrete LL. The inaccuracies in the curved shell manufacturing process produce intershell air gaps, which degrade the performance of the lens. Furthermore, this requires different materials whose relative dielectric constant covers the range 1-2. To avoid these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new LL manufacturing process. The paper is dichotomized into two main parts: the theoretical background and the performance of the obtained lens.

AB  - There is growing interest in building predictive models of species distributions over large geographic areas. As larger areas are modelled, however, it is highly likely that heterogeneity in the predictors variable increases and that areas are included where animals respond to habitats in different ways, for example, due to social status. These effects (spatial non-stationary) may weaken model performance. This paper explores whether data partitioning prior to analysis can improve the fit of models and provide ecological insight into distribution patterns. Data on three bird species were modelled for the whole of Spain at 1 km2 resolution using logistic regression analysis. Data were partitioned into geographic quarters, concentric rings around the centroid of the distribution, and into random samples for comparison. In all cases, data partitioning produced better models as assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) statistics than analysis of the global data set. Inclusion of latitude and longitude improved the global models only when added as smoothed splines but produced different probabilities to the partitioned data. Geographic partitioning is a very crude local modelling approach and we suggest that some form of geographically-weighted regression could offer the best solution to large-scale modelling but is computationally intensive on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data. It is concluded that simple partitioning by geographic quarters may detect spatial non-stationary and alert the modeller to possible problems; that partitioning into more novel arrangements may be used to test ecological hypotheses; and that data should not be partitioned spatially to build and test models if non-stationary is suspected. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In an evolutionary prospective, it is possible that female mice have a differential perception of novel events than male mice and use a different behavioural strategy for risk assessment. However, female mice are less studied than male mice in behavioural tests of emotional reactivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate how wild-derived female house mice differ from domesticated female mice in their risk assessment strategy. A total of 46 adult female mice, 14 BALB/c, 16 C57BL/6 and 14 Wild mice were tested in the Concentric Square Field (CSF), Open Field (OF) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) at three consecutive days. Parameters from all three tests were categorized according to their relevance to activity, exploration, approach-avoidance and use of open areas-shelter. Principal Component Analysis (PCA-SIMCA) of the animals' behaviour in the CSF arena was performed both for females alone and in comparison with earlier findings in male mice under the same test conditions. The results clearly show that female wild mice had a higher avoidance of open areas than the laboratory strains. There was also a trend indicating differences in exploration and approach-avoidance between female Wild and the laboratory strains. The multivariate test, CSF, was able to detect differences between Wild and laboratory strains in three (exploration, approach-avoidance, open-shelter) of the four functional categories measured. Wild female mice also had a higher frequency of rearing and grooming and a lower duration in the corridors in the CSF. Clear strain differences were found between BALB and C57BL in all tests where BALB generally had higher risk assessment and lower risk taking than C57BL. No general sex differences were found, however the sex differences were greater in Wild mice compared to the laboratory strains. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Host and habitat selection in flight by conifer bark beetles is governed by inhibition of attraction by non-host volatiles (NHV), in addition to the well-known attraction to kairomones from host plants and to aggregation pheromones from conspecifics. Antennally-active NHV from angiosperm birch and aspen trees were field tested on the European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.), by pheromone baited traps in Sweden using release rates of NHV comparable to those from a non-host tree. Trap catches were significantly reduced by 50-70% by individual NHV: trans-conophthorin, 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol from non-host bark, 1-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol from both leaves and bark and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol from leaves. Combined NHV signals in binary and ternary blends with the same overall release rates (ca 5 mg/day) showed both redundancy and synergism in their inhibitory effects. The redundancy occurred among individual green leaf alcohols (GLV-alcohols or C6-alcohols), C8-alcohols, and between these two groups, while trans-conophthorin and verbenone (Vn, from unsuitable host trees) showed significant synergistic effects between each other and with GLV-alcohols or C8-alcohols. The coexistence of redundancy and synergism in non-host chemical signals may indicate different functional levels (non-host habitats, species, and unsuitable host trees) of these negative volatile signals in the host selection process of conifer bark beetles. We showed an active inhibitory range (AIR) of a NHV-blend plus Vn on a standard pheromone bait to be at least 2 m, by using a central pheromone trap and surrounding concentric barrier trap rings with radii of 1, 2, and 4 m. The influx of bark beetles flying across concentric rings within the AIR was reduced by 55-99%, depending on the distance to the central pipe trap. Our findings support the hypothesis that as mixed forests have greater semiochemical diversity than pure host stands; they disturb olfactory guided host choice, and may reduce the possibility of outbreaks of conifer-infesting bark beetles. The synergistic effects as well as the active inhibitory range found in this study also suggest that optimal combinations of these NHV and verbenone may have potential in protecting forests against I. typographus by reducing or stopping attacks on suitable host trees. Mixed stands with higher semio-chemical diversity disturb olfactory guided host choice and reduce the risk for outbreaks of specialist herbivores. This 'semiochemical-diversity hypothesis' provides new support to the general 'stability-diversity hypothesis'.

AB  - Long-lived butterflies that hibernate as adults are expected to have well-developed antipredation devices as a result of their long exposure to natural enemies. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, for instance, is a cryptic leaf mimic when resting, but shifts to active defence when disturbed, performing a repeated sequence of movements exposing major eyespots on the wings accompanied by a hissing noise. We studied the effect of visual and auditory defence by staging experiments in which wild-caught blue tits, Parus caeruleus, were presented with one of six kinds of experimentally manipulated living peacock butterflies as follows: butterflies with eyespots painted over and their controls (painted on another part of the wing), butterflies with their sound production aborted (small part of wings removed) and their controls, and butterflies with eyespots painted over and sound production aborted and their controls. The results showed that eyespots alone, or in combination with sound, constituted an effective defence; only 1 out of 34 butterflies with intact eyespots was killed, whereas 13 out of 20 butterflies without eyespots were killed. The killed peacocks were eaten, indicating that they are not distasteful. Hence, intimidation by bluffing can be an efficient means of defence for an edible prey. © 2005 The Royal Society.

AB  - Rotavirus assembly is a multistep process that requires the successive association of four major structural proteins in three concentric layers. It has been assumed until now that VP4, the most external viral protein that forms the spikes of mature virions, associates with double-layer particles within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in conjunction with VP7 and with the help of a nonstructural protein, NSP4. VP7 and NSP4 are two glycosylated proteins. However, we recently described a strong association of VP4 with raft-type membrane microdomains, a result that makes the ER a highly questionable site for the final assembly of rotavirus, since rafts are thought to be absent from this compartment. In this study, we used tunicamycin (TM), a drug known to block the first step of protein N glycosylation, as a tool to dissect rotavirus assembly. We show that, as expected, TM blocks viral protein glycosylation and also decreases virus infectivity. In the meantime, viral particles were blocked as enveloped particles in the ER. Interestingly, TM does not prevent the targeting of VP4 to the cell surface nor its association with raft membranes, whereas the infectivity associated with the raft fractions strongly decreased. VP4 does not colocalize with the ER marker protein disulfide-isomerase even when viral particles were blocked by TM in this compartment. These results strongly support a primary role for raft membranes in rotavirus final assembly and the fact that VP4 assembly with the rest of the particle is an extrareticular event.

AB  - Eyespots (color patterns resembling eyes) are present in many taxa and often have important ecological functions. In some taxa, potential functions of eyespots have not been extensively examined, as is the case with pygmy-owls (Glaucidium spp.), many of which bear a conspicuous eye-like pattern on their nape. Using wooden replicas of Northern Pygmy-Owls (G. gnoma), with and without eyespots, we tested one potential function: whether eyespots affect mobbing behaviors of small forest birds. We measured the orientation of mobbing behaviors (where birds perched and flew at the model) and intensity of mobbing bouts (duration of bouts and number of mobbing individuals). Eyespots affected the most proximal behavior, close passing (flights directly at the model, resulting in an approach within 0.5 m). When eyespots were present, mobbers shifted away from eyespots, providing the first empirical evidence for a link between eyespots and avian mobbing.

AB  - Three categories of fossil aggregates are recognized in the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale biota from SW China: (1) elliptical aggregates with randomly distributed exoskeletal remains of typically small- to medium-size bivalved arthropods (e.g., ostracode-like bradoriids, phyllocarid-like waptiids), hyoliths, and trilobites are interpreted as coprolites, possibly produced by anomalocaridids (e.g., waptiid-rich coprolites) and / or unknown epibenthic predators; (2) elongate, ribbon-like aggregates composed of oriented small hyolith shells, interpreted as the feces of infaunal carnivorous worms such as priapulids; and (3) concentric aggregates, typically with a central nucleus (e.g., remains of medusoid eldoniids or bivalved arthropod carapaces) and peripheral exoskeletal fragments, possibly generated by bottom currents whirling around carcasses. These new coprolite data add to morphofunctional information obtained from fossil organisms and indicate that predation occurred at different levels of the water column with: (1) endobenthic predators (diverse priapulid fauna) feeding near the sediment-water interface; (2) epibenthic predators/scavengers (almost exclusively arthropods); (3) predators living in the lower levels of the water column (e.g., anomalocaridids); and (4) mid-water predators exploiting upper levels in the water column (e.g., eldoniids, clenophores, chaetognaths). Communities living at or close to the water-sediment interface (epibenthic sensu stricto, meiobenthic, and demersal animals) were exposed to a multidirectional predatorial pressure from infaunal, epifaunal, and mid-water predators. Although predation was diverse, nothing indicates that the food chain extended beyond the level of primary carnivores. Animals already had acquired complex behaviors such as hunting (e.g., anomalocaridids, priapulids) and predator avoidance in which sensory systems were involved. The example of the Maotianshan Shale indicates that the burst of anatomical innovations (new body plans) that characterizes the early Cambrian also was accompanied by the rapid development of new feeding strategies and by an unprecedented expansion of ecological interactions (prey-predator relationships).

AB  - An emended interpretation is offered of the gross xylem structure and development of the haustorium of Psittacanthus ramiflorus (DC.) G. Don (Loranthaceae) and the woodrose induced on its hosts, based on decorticated material. At the point of entry, the host cambium is split or perhaps locally destroyed but regenerates, eventually in an inverted position, with its initials apparently assuming a position perpendicular to the mother branch. The resultant cambial 'front' is apparently strongly stimulated in some areas while nearly inactive in others, resulting in a basket-like structure of branching and anastomosing arms of xylem which eventually fuse completely. The parasite develops successive, concentric layers of xylem strands which connect perpendicularly to the inner margin of the woodrose. These xylem strands fuse upwardly, merging into tongue-like layers of normal xylem applied to older xylem. Brief reference is made to variation of woodroses in other species of Psittacanthus and to the latter's xylem connection to a hyperparasitic Phoradendron (Viscaceae). © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Objectives: Although previous research shows that the hamstring length-tension relationship during eccentric contractions plays a role in hamstring injury, training methods to promote beneficial adaptations are still unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether an eccentric hamstring specific training programme results in favourable adaptations. Design: Eccentric training consisting of the Nordic hamstring exercise performed twice a week for four weeks. Pre- and post-training concentric/ concentric isokinetic testing of peak torque (PT) and position of peak torque (POS) was performed for both the quadriceps and hamstrings of both legs at 60° s-1. Vertical jump height was also assessed. Participants: Nine athletic, male subjects with no previous strength training experience. Results: There was a significant increase in vertical jump height (pre=51.0±4.8 cm, post=54.4±6.3 cm, p=0.04), a significant reduction in quadriceps PT (pre=204.6±21.9 N.m., post=181.5±19.9 N.m., p=0.01), a significant decrease in hamstring POS from full knee extension (pre=32.5±7.4°, post=26.2±8.6°, p=0.01) and a significant hamstring POS difference between limbs (dominant=33.8±9.5°, non-dominant=24.9±6.5°, p=0.01). Conclusion: Nordic hamstring exercise training may produce favourable neuromuscular adaptations for the possible prevention of hamstring injuries while enhancing performance in athletic, untrained males. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The anatomical characteristics of Nectria canker on Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica were analyzed. Typical cankers were conspicuous, round to oval, with uniform concentric rings of affected xylem in a target-like structure. Each concentric annual growth ring was wider than the corresponding annual rings lateral to the cankers. The xylem elements were extremely disoriented. The cambial zone became discontinuous and disappeared. An inoculation test with the causal fungus, Nectria galligena, produced similar anatomical abnormalities and revealed the process of canker formation. Fewer and narrower vessels were formed, and water conduction took place only in the large vessels of the current year in the cankers.

AB  -                              The Equivalence Principle, which states that gravitational mass and inertial mass are different ways of measuring the same property, is the experimental foundation for modern gravitational theory. Modern theory cannot reconcile gravity with the other fundamental forces. One possibility is that the present theory of gravity, general relativity, is incomplete or incorrect. If this is the case, the Equivalence Principle may be violated at some level beyond the one part in 10                             12                              that has been experimentally verified. The goal of the Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP) is to improve this result to better than one part in 10                             18                             . In STEP two or more concentric, cylindrical test masses "fall" around the Earth in a drag-free satellite. The masses are cooled to < 2K and supported by frictionless, superconducting, linear bearings. Ultra-sensitive SQUID position detectors measure their relative motion. A confirmed violation could provide key information toward the possible unification of the four fundamental forces; conversely, a null result can rule out competing theories or constrain new theories. MiniSTEP is the least expensive mission proposed to date that still achieves STEP's basic scientific goal. It compares four different materials in four differential accelerometers. Cost saving is achieved by operating the accelerometers sequentially, thereby avoiding duplicated equipment. The drag-free satellite will be built around an existing superfluid helium dewar and a small, semi-production spacecraft. A small commercial launch vehicle will place the satellite in a 400 km, sun-synchronous, polar, Earth orbit. Nominal mission lifetime is four months - but a six to eight month life is expected. © 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extent of damage to the host plant caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) and var. graminis (Ggg) is a result of a net effect of host susceptibility and mycelium infectivity. The disease severity on cereal roots caused by G. graminis (Gg) fungi varies considerably depending on the genetic subtypes. Results of our rhizobox placement experiments additionally showed a subtype-specific effect of the spatial distance between host and fungus on the infection. The highest pathogenicity of each subtype was found in different zones of the root system: pathozones of different subtypes alternated along the root. The extent of the pathozone profiles did not depend on the infectivity of the inoculum and plant age. However, disease severity was shown to be affected by defence reactions of the host plant. An attack of a fungal subtype that is easily recognized by the host plant leads to defence reactions like increased root growth, thus minimizing the damage to the shoot. Detailed analysis showed that a Ggt subtype had a high potential for colonizing root laterals. It formed concentric zones of high colonization efficiency at a distance of ca. 5 cm around the shoot. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work is concerned with the analysis of composite sleeve reinforcement systems for metallic pipelines undergoing elastic or inelastic deformations. In these systems, a piping or vessel segment is reinforced by wrapping it with concentric coils of composite material. The main goal is to develop a methodology as simple as possible to define the necessary thickness of composite material to assure: (a) the safety of repairs under operation conditions and/or (b) the lifetime extension under operation conditions. Such methodology, although simple, is able to account for different failure mechanisms (plasticity, fatigue, fracture). A computer program, has been developed to automatically evaluate the minimum thickness of reinforcement to be used for different imperfections or damage that impair the serviceability of a segment of steel transmission line. It is suggested the use of the composite sleeve as repair system itself (mainly to avoid or to restrain the propagation of internal flaws) but also as a complementary procedure to enhance the reliability of weldments, eliminating the necessity of heat treatment. Examples concerning the use of composite reinforcement in different damage situations are presented and analyzed showing the possibilities of practical use of the proposed methodology in the design of safer and more reliable repair systems.

AB  - An increasing use of forest sampling and a huge progress in individual-tree growth modelling offered a new field of application for individual-tree growth models: predicting forest growth by updating tree data of individual sample plots. What is usually overlooked by such applications is the fact that the sampling design for collecting the parameterization data of the model, in particular plot size, has an effect on specific model coefficients. Therefore, biased predictions will be obtained if a different sampling design is used for collecting data that should be used for growth predictions (JAAKKOLA, 1967; STAGE and WYKOFF, 1998; HYNYNEN and OJANSUU, 2003). HANN and ZUMRAWI (1991) showed that this bias plays only a subordinated role for a single-period growth prediction. However, they pointed out that it is unknown how this error will propagate, but they expected an accumulation in case of long term projections. In this study we tested this hypothesis by means of two simulation examples using the distance-independent individual-tree growth simulator PROGNAUS (MONSERUD and STERBA, 1996, 1999). Data came from a 20 year old stand of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). We performed one simulation run for the entire stand (1 ha), and one for 9 angle-count sample plots that were also located within this stand. The analyses of the simulation runs revealed that primarily the competition variable BAL (Basal-Area-in-Larger Trees: WYKOFF, 1990) is responsible for the biased predictions. The reason is that plot size is fixed at the start of the simulation runs, but tree size and spacing change during the span of simulated stand development (STAGE and WYKOFF, 1998). On small sample plots this leads to an increasing disproportion between tree dimensions and plot size that causes an excessive deviation from the original sampling design and affects the BAL variable in favor of the thickest trees on the sample plots (Tab. 1 and Fig. 1). Because BAL is the only competition variable in the mortality function of PROGNAUS (MONSERUD and STERBA, 1999), the thickest trees of the plots (their BAL equal 0) have reduced mortality rates, therefore increasing the competition pressure on the smaller trees. The result of this phenomenon is that all the smaller trees die, and only the thickest trees on the plots survive. Moreover, their represented tree numbers per hectare are too high because of the reduced mortality rates. This leads in the long run to a biased prediction of the basal area development. Also the DBH distribution at the end of the simulation period is biased (Fig. 2). In order to prevent the shift of the BAL variable in favor of the thickest trees LEDERMANN and ECKMÜLLNER (2004) presented the tree record splitting method to attain uniform resolution of this competition variable. The BAL resolution is defined as the differences in BAL of neighbouring trees in the DBH distribution. Applying the splitting method to angle-count sampling data, a tree record is divided into two identical tree records, each representing 50% of the original tree number per hectare. At the end of the splitting procedure the BAL of every tree record is updated (Tab. 2). In case of splitting the thickest tree record, only 50% of its original tree number still have a BAL of 0 while the other 50%, represented by the new tree record, have a BAL > 0. This yields a higher mortality rate and a reduced diameter increment of the new tree record, finally resulting in an unbiased prediction of the basal area development, and showing a realistic DBH distribution (Fig. 4). When the splitting procedure needs to be applied depends on the inventory design that was used for sampling the parameterization data of a simulator's sub-models. If these data came from angle-count samples, then a tree record needs to be split when its represented basal area per hectare equals or exceeds 4/3 of the basal area factor k used for data sampling. If the parameterization data came from concentric circles that were combined with different minimum diameters for data recording, then it needs to be checked at the end of each prediction cycle whether a tree exceeded the next larger minimum diameter. For example, if a tree's DBH is 9 cm and this tree is recorded on a plot with 2.5 m radius (Tab. 3), then its represented tree number per hectare is 509.3. If the DBH of this tree exceeds 10 cm during the next growing period, then the tree would be recorded on a plot with 5 m radius, and its represented tree number per hectare would be 127.3. However, due to the fact that the new plot size is four times the old plot size, three additional tree records are needed, and the original tree number of 509.3 needs to be equally distributed to four (1 old + 3 new) tree records. The results of this study also show that the bias of the simulated basal area increases as the length of the simulation period increases (Fig. 2). Hence, one could argue whether a simulation period of 150 years is justified since there are so many unpredictable things that could happen. This argument is basically true, but there are some specific applications where long-term prognoses are needed (e.g. scenario analyses in order to evaluate the effect of a changing management strategy). Moreover, in many yield tables the length of the growing (prediction) period is also more than 100 years. In general, the results of this study indicate that tree record splitting is an appropriate method to prevent a deviation from the original sampling design of the parameterization data (Figs. 1 and 3). Therefore, it allows for a differentiation with regard to tree size (DBH), making the simulation results of an existing model more realistic.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation may prevent cardiac hypertrophy and inhibit production of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a hypertrophic agent. The aim of this in vivo study was to investigate the effects of PPAR activators on cardiac remodeling in DOCA-salt rats, a model overexpressing ET-1. Unilaterally nephrectomized 16-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Uni-Nx) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control rats, DOCA-salt, DOCA-salt+rosiglitazone (PPAR-γ activator, 5 mg/kg per day), and DOCA-salt+fenofibrate (PPAR-α activator, 100 mg/kg per day). After 3 weeks of treatment, mean arterial blood pressure was significantly increased in DOCA-salt by 36 mm Hg. Mean arterial blood pressure was normalized by coadministration of rosiglitazone but not by fenofibrate. Both PPAR activators prevented cardiac fibrosis and abrogated the increase in prepro-ET-1 mRNA content in the left ventricle of DOCA-salt rats. Coadministration of rosiglitazone or fenofibrate failed to prevent thickening of left ventricle (LV) walls as measured by echocardiography and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels. However, rosiglitazone and fenofibrate prevented the decrease in LV internal diameter and thus concentric remodeling of the LV found in DOCA-salt rats. Taken together, these data indicate a modulatory role of PPAR activators on cardiac remodeling in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension, in part associated with decreased ET-1 production. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The multi-tube modeling scheme has been increasingly used in the industry to model top-tensioned risers due to the growing application of concentric, dual casing riser systems. One of the major advantages of using a multi-tube modeling scheme over the conventional composite modeling scheme is the former's ability to simulate the installation/completion sequence. From the analysis, the inner riser strings preloads can be determined so that the potential inner string bulking problem can be avoided when the riser is in production. Since these preloads will alter the tension distribution among riser strings, any riser analysis without considering them will not produce the correct results. This paper presents the application of the multi-tube modeling scheme in simulating the riser installation/completion sequence to determine the inner strings preloads. The difficulties associated with this unique analysis are identified, and the analysis methodologies used to overcome these difficulties are explained. There are quite a few steps in the riser running procedure, and if every riser analysis has to include all of these steps to faithfully model what the real riser experiences, it would present a tremendous burden to the analyst. A simplified 3-step analysis is proposed and the results are compared with the full-steps results. Also presented is the comparison of the tension distribution among riser strings between analyses with and without the preloads to demonstrate the importance of this kind of analysis.

AB  - Circular Couette flow of inelastic shear-thinning materials in annuli is examined. The curved streamlines of the circular Couette flow can cause a centrifugal instability leading to toroidal vortices, well known as Taylor vortices. The presence of these vortices changes the hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics of the processes at which this type of flow occurs. Therefore, it is quite important to be able to predict the onset of instability. Most of the available theoretical and experimental analyses are for Newtonian and viscoelastic (dilute polymeric solutions) liquids. In this work, the effect of the shear-thinning behavior of high concentration suspensions on the onset of the Taylor vortices is determined theoretically by solving the conservation equations, constructing the solution path as the inner cylinder speed rises and searching for the critical conditions. This procedure avoids the need for a stability analysis of the flow and the solution of an eigenproblem. The differential equations were solved by the Galerkin/finite-element method and the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations, by Newton's method.

AB  - Character optimization methods can be used to reconstruct ancestral states at the internal nodes of phylogenetic trees. However, seldom are these ancestral states visualized collectively. Ancient Wings is a computer program that provides a novel method of visualizing the evolution of several morphological traits simultaneously. It allows users to visualize how the ventral hindwing pattern of 54 butterflies in the genus Bicyclus may have changed over time. By clicking on each of the nodes within the evolutionary tree, the user can see an animation of how wing size, eyespot size, and eyespot position relative the wing margin, have putatively evolved as a collective whole. Ancient Wings may be used as a pedagogical device as well as a research tool for hypothesis-generation in the fields of evolutionary, ecological, and developmental biology. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Collocated circular loops form an important class of antenna structures with potential for use in direction-finding and many other applications. In this paper, a general formulation for analyzing a set of arbitrarily oriented circular loops is first presented. The formulation is then used to analyze various collocated loop configurations. In particular, collocated orthogonal and skewed loops are discussed. Two new types of antennas, the Butterfly-loop and the Direct-coupled Concentric Half-loop are also discussed. For all the cases, the theoretical results of the analysis were in close agreement with the measured results. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - Many important areas of aircraft engine noise concern regimes where frequencies are sufficiently high that corresponding approximations can be made. At such frequencies modal populations are high and approximate methods based on modal averaging can be applied. In this paper the normalised variance of the deviation of the modecount from its average value is examined for circular ducts. Periodic orbit theory, first developed in quantum physics, is used to provide a value for this normalised variance is found and compared with numerical predictions. The implications for concentric and eccentric annular ducts are examined. It is shown that as eccentricity is varied eigenvalues show 'avoided crossings'. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) follows unaccustomed muscular exercise, most notably in the eccentric mode. That concept refers to a dull ache combined with tenderness, stiffness and weakness of the previously active muscles. Isokinetic device constitutes a specific model in generating and investigating DOMS. Respective effects of concentric and eccentric actions have been compared, emphasizing on the variability in the response (serum activity of CK for instance). The particular sensitivity of the hamstrings was underlined although causes remained unexplained. Some treatment have been proposed in the management of DOMS. Several studies reported that anti-inflammatory agents fail to alleviate pain and discomfort even if other authors indicated a relative effectiveness. Based on the repeated-bout effect, submaximal eccentric exercise currently represent the most useful preventive strategy.

AB  - In interactions, many tropical stomatopod species display conspicuous colored body spots that can communicate information about the sender's state (e.g., sex, aggressiveness, etc.). Species inhabiting a variety of depths experience large differences in illumination spectrum and intensity due to filtering of light by water and its constituents. Stomatopod spectral sensitivity is known to vary phenotypically with changes in light environment (associated with depth) that potentially affects the detection of color signals. Animals collected at different depths also have different body coloration. This study examines how spectral differences in colored body spots vary with organismal condition and models the effects of changing body coloration, light environment, and spectral sensitivity on the detection of color signals in a gonodactyloid species, Gonodactylus smithii. Of the seven conspicuous color spots that were measured in G. smithii, three had spectral differences that correlated with sex, aggression, and female reproductive state. A model of color detection in G. smithii indicates that longer-wavelength spectral content was affected most by varying body coloration and light conditions. Most color signals were perceived similarly both by shallow- and by deep-adapted photoreceptor sets over a range of depths (1-13 m). Eye spot ('meral spot') color detection also was invariant over the same depth range in shallow- and deep-adapted, long-wavelength receptors, but deep-adapted receptors continued to maintain a consistent detection of these spots down to 18 meters. These results suggest that meral spot coloration may have evolved as a constant signal when viewed by conspecifics from various depths. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Optical fibers are drawn from preforms (fused silica glass rods) typically made up of two concentric cylinders (the core rod and the clad tube), which are usually joined in a separate fusion process. The setup time and hence manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced if the two cylinders can be joined in the same furnace in which the fiber is drawn. A good understanding of the transient temperature distribution is needed for controlling the feed rate to avoid thermally induced cracks. Since direct measurement of the temperature fields is often impossible, the geometrical design of the preform and the control of the feed rate have largely been accomplished by trials-and-errors. The ability to predict the transient temperature distribution and the thermally induced stresses will provide a rational basis to design optimization and feed rate control of the process. In this paper, we present an analytical model to predict the transient conductive-radiative transfer as two partially joined, concentric glass cylinders with specular surfaces are fed into the furnace. Finite volume method (FVM) is used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The specular surface reflectivity is obtained by the Fresnel’s law and the Snell’s law. The boundary intensities are obtained through the coupling of the interior glass radiative transfer and the exterior furnace enclosure analysis. The model has been used to numerically study the transient conductive-radiative transfer in the advanced melting zone (AMZ) of an optic fiber drawing process. This problem is of both theoretical and practical interest in the manufacture of optical fibers. The computational method for the radiation transfer developed in this paper can also be applied to the simulation of the fiber drawing process and other glass-related manufacturing processes. © 2004 by ASME.

AB  - Buckling-restrained bracing frames (BRBF) as a building's primary seimsic-load resisting system are discussed. The buckling-restrained brace employed can function as intended, providing adequate maximum and cumulative ductility capacity, including any required rotational deformations. The buckling-restrained braces use the inherent ductility of steel to provide system ductility by preventing extreme concentrations of inelastic strain. Frames using these braces can designed as an effective and efficient seismic-load-resisting system.

AB  - Three experiments on winter wheat, each lasting 5 years and on different soil types, were used to test the effects of incorporating different amounts of straw, mainly to determine the importance of achieving uniform distribution to avoid adverse effects on grain yield. Decreases in crop growth and/or grain yield as a consequence of incorporating straw were detected in the first year. The decreases were much larger in one experiment where straw was imported and applied to soil that had been fallowed for 12 months before sowing the wheat than in the other two where the straw was incorporated following the harvest of a winter wheat crop. In the subsequent 4 years, incorporating up to 20 t straw/ha had no significant effects on grain yield but there were some significant effects on concentrations and uptakes of N, P and K, especially on the heavier textured soils. The effects on crop growth and yield that were detected in the first year on each site are tentatively attributed to decreases in available N representing that which was required to support the decomposition of the incorporated straw. The relative lack of significant effects in subsequent years seems to imply that a significant proportion of this N was remineralized relatively quickly, and thus available to support the decomposition of the straw that was incorporated in the second year and, after further recycling, in the years after that. Eyespot, caused by the fungus Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, was decreased by incorporating straw but there were few significant effects on other diseases. The results provide a generally reassuring message for farmers in suggesting that on most, if not all, soils there is little cause for concern about the consequences of incorporating even large amounts of wheat straw before sowing a further crop of winter wheat.

AB  - While several image-based rendering techniques have been proposed to successfully render scenes/objects from a large collection (e.g., thousands) of images without explicitly recovering 3D structures, the minimum number of images needed to achieve a satisfactory rendering result remains an open problem. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the lower bound for the number of samples needed in the Lumigraph/light field rendering. To simplify the analysis, we consider an ideal scene with only a point that is between a minimum and a maximum range. Furthermore, constant-depth assumption and bilinear interpolation are used for rendering. The constant-depth assumption serves to choose 'nearby' rays for interpolation. Our criterion to determine the lower bound is to avoid horizontal and vertical double images, which are caused by interpolation using multiple nearby rays. This criterion is based on the causality requirement is scale-space theory, i.e., no 'spurious details' should be generated while smoothing. Using this criterion, closed-form solutions of lower bounds are obtained for both 3D plenoptic function (Concentric Mosaics) and 4D plenoptic function (light field). The bounds are derived completely from the aspect of geometry and are closely related to the resolution of the camera and the depth range of the scene. These lower bounds are further verified by our experimental results.

AB  - Experimental study was made to confirm the validity of new designs of the auxiliary cooling system for the high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR). First, it is necessary to vent residence air in outlet side of water chamber of the auxiliary heat exchanger for the HTTR. Accordingly, we have proposed to mount a proper bend duct in the outlet side of the water chamber. Air vent is done by difference between pressures at both ends of the bend duct caused by the forced water circulation using the water pumps. From flow tests, it was confirmed that it is capable of venting the air through the bend duct by circulating the water in maximum capacity of the water pumps. Second, it is essential to prevent seizure and excessive wear of the liner slides of the auxiliary concentric hot gas duct for the HTTR at a service temperature of 950°C. Therefore, we have put forward to coat titanium nitride (TiN) on the surface of the liner slides made of nickel-based superalloy Hastelloy XR using the thermochemical vapor deposition method. As a result of seizure and wear tests, it was confirmed that the TiN coating film of 3 μm on the surface of Hastelloy XR is sufficient. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper described a new method to plan out the welding path of multiple robots. Dividing workcell with concentric columns, the algorithm combines characteristics of free arc to find out the possible welding paths for multiple robots. At the same time, it tries to find an optimized path by use of selecting nodes on the free arcs and linking the selected nodes. Doing this under virtual manufacturing (VM) environment with ROBCAD software, it settles free-collision and shortens the planning time sharply. This also helps to find a new development path for multiple robots.

AB  - In this paper we propose to simultaneously detect lane and pavement boundaries by fusing information from both optical and radar images. The boundaries are described with concentric circular models, whose parameters are compatible and will result in better conditioned estimation problems than previous parabolic models. The optical and radar imaging processes are represented with Gaussian and log-normal probability densities, with which we successfully avoid the ad hoc weighting scheme carried on the two likelihood functions. The multisensor fusion boundary detection problem is posed in a Bayesian framework and a joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is employed to locate the lane and pavement boundaries. Experimental results have shown that the fusion algorithm outperforms single sensor based boundary detection algorithms in a variety of road scenarios. And it also yields better boundary detection results than the fusion algorithm that took advantage of existing prior and likelihood formulations.

AB  - Through a spatial, multi-scale approach I compared available habitat with habitat used by whooping cranes (Grus americana) on their nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. Thirty-two study sites (16 used, 16 available) were established in the nesting area in August 1996. Data were gathered by (a) plots of 9.8 m radius which provided detailed site data and served as ground truth for (b) concentric circular plots of 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 m radius in which 21 cover types were mapped onto false color infrared 1:15,840 airphotos. Whooping cranes chose habitat that differed from a random sample. Habitat selection was strongest at the nest site, where many attributes of habitat type and structure were evident. Beyond 200 m radius from the nest site, selection was evident solely as avoidance of unsuitable habitat. At the nest site scale (9.8 m radius), the preferred habitat was visually open, with large amounts of open water (median depth 7 cm in August), nearby which there were a few abundant vegetation species in an open spatial arrangement. Habitat types used by whooping cranes were diatom ponds, bulrush (Scirpus validus) marshes, bulrush/cattail (Typha latifolia) mixed marshes with aquatic macrophytes, and shrubby mixed marshes with water sedge (Carex aquatilis) and cattail. Plant species diversity of the entire crane area is low, particularly that of nesting sites. In contrast, spatial diversity of community types is a marked characteristic of the area; average patch size is < 1 ha. At the 78.5 ha scale (500 m radius), there were no apparent differences in landscape structure or diversity between used vs available habitats. MANOVA/repeated measures and multi-response permutation procedures were used to examine habitat selection at five spatial scales. Whooping cranes selected bulrush marsh out to a radius of 200 m from the nest, and avoided featureless shrub bogs and fens out to a radius of at least 500 m from nests. Historical and present nesting habitat share the following characteristics: small shallow lakes and ponds, willow communities, marshes of bulrush and cattail, mudflats, and perhaps sedge meadows. The present nesting habitat may be atypical compared to the core of the historical range in its diatom ponds, gypsum karst-groundwater discharge hydrogeology, and permafrost. Cranes appear to use only a small portion of the total available area of their nesting grounds. The Wood Buffalo-Aransas whooping crane population should not be limited by available breeding habitat in the near future.

AB  - Crater disease (CD) of wheat is caused by a Rhizoctonia solani strain of ambiguous phylogeny. Anastomosis reactions confirmed placement of CD-causing R. solani in anastomosis group (AG) 6, with results indicating a closer affinity to AG-6 GV than to AG-6 HG. Cultures of CD isolates were initially white to cream, turning a yellowish light brown after 10 days. Concentric rings of dark and light mycelium were evident from an early stage. Mycelium generally was appressed to the agar surface, with sparse aerial growth. A few light-colored, irregularly shaped sclerotia could be discerned after 2 weeks. The mean hyphal diameter of CD-causing R. solani was 7.46 lam (ranging from 5.0 to 10.0 μm), and cells contained a mean number of four (ranging from two to eight) nuclei, compared to a mean hyphal diameter of 8.58 and 8.42 μm and a mean nuclear number of six and four for AG-6 HG and AG-6 GV, respectively. The CD isolates had a slower growth rate (15.3 mm/day) than AG-6 HG (29.1 mm/day) and AG-6 GV (22.6 mm/day) but, like AG-6, were thiamine prototrophic. Conspicuous nodulose swellings were produced by CD-causing R. solani on roots of wheat, and infection resulted in retarded shoot growth. Smaller nodules were evident on bean and soybean roots. Fingerprint patterns generated for the various isolates with four enzymes, HpaII, Sau3AI, TaqI, and CfoI, showed the presence of a unique 610-bp fragment in the pathogen. It is proposed that CD-causing R. solani isolates represent a distinct intersterility group within AG-6 that is more related to subgroup GV than to subgroup HG.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a troublesome long-term complication of heart transplantation. It is manifested by a unique and unusually accelerated form of coronary disease affecting both intramural and epicardial coronary arteries and veins. CAV is characterized by vascular injury induced by a variety of noxious stimuli, including the immune system response to the allograft, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infection, immunosuppressive drugs, and classic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. The obstructive vascular lesions are thought to progress through repetitive endothelial injury followed by repair response. The role of major histocompatibility complex donor-recipient differences in the pathogenesis of CAV has not yet been completely elucidated. Intracoronary ultrasound studies reveal a dual morphology with donor-transmitted or de novo focal, noncircumferential plaques in proximal segments and/or a diffuse, concentric pattern observed in distal segments. A lack of correlation between microvascular and epicardial vessel disease suggests discordant manifestations and progression of CAV. Apoptosis and loss of functional vascular remodeling have to be considered as important mediators of clinically relevant CAV. Strategies for blocking T-cell costimulation and expression of adhesion molecules may help prevent chronic rejection in clinical transplantation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase inhibitors and antiproliferative drugs may slow progression of CAV by various effects. Methods to augment endogenous nitric oxide bioavailability as well as newer immunosuppressive regimens may be protective. Balloon angioplasty has a limited role in the treatment of focal lesions. Experiences with coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass grafting, and transmyocardial laser revascularization are limited. Retransplantation has a worse outcome than initial transplantation.

AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is attacked by many parasitic fungi which often occur in mixed infections. Monitoring of these phytopathogens by morphological criteria is restricted due to their appearance especially in the later stages of disease development. We have developed molecular markers for a clear-cut differentiation of a variety of rape seed pathogenic fungi based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Twenty polymorphic fragments have been selected in Southern hybridization experiments to test their taxon-specificity. In summary, only four amplification products gave unspecific cross-hybridization patterns, one fragment corresponds to a genetic element common to three species within the genus Alternaria, and 15 RAPD markers were highly specific for distinct fungal species. This report demonstrates the value of the RAPD-PCR technique to amplify taxon-specific DNA fragments that can be used as hybridization probes for the diagnosis of a variety of rape seed pathogens (Alternaria brassicae, A. brassicicola, A. raphani; Cylindrosporium concentricum; Fusarium moniliforme; Phoma lingam; Pythium sp.; Rhizoctonia solani; Sclerotinia scleratiorum; Verticillium dahliae.

AB  - The African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, normally possesses circular eyespots on its wings. Artificial selection lines, which express ellipsoidal eyespots on the dorsal surface of the forewing, were used to investigate correlated changes in wing shape. Morphometric analysis of linear wing measurements and wing scale counts provided evidence that eyespot shape was correlated with localised shape changes in the corresponding wing-cell, with overall shape changes in the wing, and with the density/arrangement of scales around the eyespot area.

AB  - Symptoms of bacterial canker disease on tomato were first observed in June 1998, in three tomato fields in the semi-mountainous region of Eptagonia (Limassol district). In two of these fields, which were planted with cv. FA 179, infection was almost 100%, with heavy losses. The third field, planted with cv. Graziella, had only sporadic infections. An extensive survey during 1998-99 detected 10 additional cases of bacterial canker, all in the wider agro-ecological zone of initial disease detection. The pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis was consistently isolated from diseased plants, identified, and its pathogenicity proved. This is the first report of bacterial canker disease on tomato in Cyprus.

AB  - Wood degradation by the white-rot basidiomycete Meripilus giganteus (Pers.:Pers.) Karst. was studied in naturally infected and artificially inoculated wood of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.). Semi-thin sections revealed that the secondary walls of most fibres contained internal cavities. Three distinct types of cavity formation, which differed not only between hosts, but also between cell type and location in the annual ring, were identified. Within discoloured wood of naturally infected beech, the structure of the cavities and their formation by the associated hyphae were reminiscent of a soft-rot. By contrast, cavity formation in artificially inoculated beech and large-leaved lime wood differed from a soft-rot mode of attack as extensive delignification always preceded cavity formation, and neither T-branching, L-bending, nor hyphal growth were found within cell walls. The formation of half-moon shaped cavities in beech wood was present only in tension-wood fibres. From large diameter hyphae, growing within the fibre lumen, numerous fine perforation hyphae extended transversely via helical cracks into the cell wall. Subsequent degradation of cellulose within concentric layers of the tension-wood fibres commenced from the apices of perforation hyphae. Sections stained with ruthenium red and hydroxylamine-ferric chloride, revealed that M. giganteus preferentially degrades pectin-rich regions of the middle lamellae in xylary ray cells. In large-leaved lime, such regions were uniformly located in the middle lamellae of axial and ray parenchyma. In beech wood, degradation of pectin-rich middle lamellae regions commenced after the delignification of secondary walls and resulted in a conspicuous hollowing of multiseriate xylem rays. Plasticity in wood degradation modes by M. giganteus in large-leaved lime and beech wood reflects variations in cell wall structure and/or prevailing wood conditions.

AB  - A new type of solid horn with metallic diaphragms has been developed by the authors. The horn transduces the little longitudinal vibration to the extremely large flexural one. Therefore it is possible to shorten and to make lighter the ultrasonic vibration system by replacing connected horns to a simple new horn. It is thought that the horn is suitable as a high power ultrasound source, further the high efficiency of the sound radiation is obtained by the larger area and in-phase vibration of sound radiation face. Thus the authors have investigated a free vibration of a solid horn with double concentric diaphragms which has large displacement amplitude, large diameter and in-phase vibration. In this paper, the directivity of the solid horn with double concentric diaphragms are verifyed theoretically and experimentally, and compared to other ultrasonic sound sources. Furthemore, the stresses applied on the diaphragm analyzed using FEM to design the dimensions and to avoid stress concentration on diaphragm. © 1998, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The fine structure of zoosporogenesis, zoospore germination, and early gametophyte development in Cladophora surera Parodi et Caceres were studied. Zoosporogenesis started with simultaneous meiosis in all nuclei of apical initial cells. The resulting haploid nuclei duplicated in turn by successive centric, closed mitoses. Then, each initial cell divided into two short zoosporangia. Numerous vacuoles appeared around each sporic nucleus. The delimitation of uninucleate zoosporocytes occurred by cytokinetic furrows produced by the coalescence of tiny, clear vesicles, without microtubules. Final shape of the zoospore resulted from gradual expulsion of vacuoles from the cell body. Mature biflagellate zoospores exhibited a conspicuous apical papilla containing fine granular globules, the basal apparatus, and a microtubular 'umbrella' formed by numerous cortical microtubules that ran backward the length of the cell body. The chloroplast showed a conspicuous eyespot. The zoosporangial wall disorganized at the pore through which the zoospores were liberated. Zoospores settled on a substrate by their anterior papilla secreting an adhesive. Germination involved retraction of the apical papilla, loss of the 'umbrella' microtubules and eyespot, and the lateral absorption of the entire flagellar apparatus, i.e. basal apparatus plus axoneme, into the cytoplasm. Early gametophyte development involved the synthesis of a thin, young cell wall, the development of outer peripheral vacuoles, the appearance of the marginal reticulate chloroplast, and the formation of the first central vacuoles derived from abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Close to the plasmalemma ran longitudinally oriented cortical microtubules. Eventually, the germling developed an achlorophylic, elongated rhizoidal portion.

AB  - The thickening properties of many commercial thickeners are difficult to measure because of wall slip artefacts. Here we report a series of experiments on a typical thickener where these artefacts have been successfully eliminated. As a result, complete, steady-state flow-curves of aqueous Carbopol 980 (the toxico-logically preferred version of the older and more well-known Carbopol 940) dispersions are reported for a range of concentrations of 0.045-1.0 wt%. The vane-and-basket flow geometry was used to avoid slip problems at low shear stress, with the geometry housed in a TA AR1000-N controlled-stress rheometer, whilst a Haake RV2 viscometer with an SV2P and MV2P concentric-cylinder geometries were used at higher shear rates. The flow-curves obtained show a smooth but steep transition from a very high Newtonian viscosity at low shear stress to a much lower viscosity at high shear stress. No real yield stresses were detected, but the higher shear rate results can be fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley model, which assumes an apparent yield stress.

AB  - Methods for measuring the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, density and viscosity of molten slags and fluxes have been critically reviewed. The most common method for determining the viscosity of slags is the concentric cylinder method and in particular the rotating bob variant. There is now a well established reference material suitable for high temperatures and two standards for the most common materials investigated i.e. glass and mould powders. For low viscosities (of the order of 5mPa.s) the oscillating vessel method is suitable. The oscillating plate method has been investigated extensively for the measurement of mould fluxes by Japanese workers. A major problem is the containment of the slags to prevent unwanted reactions and the choice of materials used by a selection of workers is reviewed. Fewer density than viscosity measurements have been made. The most popular methods of determining densities are the maximum bubble pressure (also suitable for determining surface tension); Archimedean and sessile drop methods. There is no corresponding infra structure for density measurements of slags as for their viscosities. For the thennal diffusivity/conductivity, the most common methods are the laser flash and the transient hot wire techniques. The treatment of the experimental results is complicated, such as including the effects of radiation for translucent materials. It is clear, if the information is industrially important, there are substantial opportunities for further method development including standardisation and understanding the physical processes of heat transfer in these materials.

AB  - We analyzed variation in canopy closure around 47 Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) nest sites and 47 random forest sites on the Coconino National Forest in northcentral Arizona. We mapped distinct habitat polygons on 1:15,840 color aerial photographs, assigned each polygon to one of 4 canopy-closure classes (<10, 10-10, 41-70, or >70%), and measured the area in each canopy class within 5 concentric analysis zones with radii of 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 km (delineating rings of about 4, 47, 150, 252, and 352 ha). Landscape composition differed between spotted owl nest and random sites (P < 0.001). Differences were greatest within 0.4 km of nest and random sites but persisted across all analyses zones. Nest sites contained more area in the >70% canopy-closure class and less area in the < 10% class. The most abundant canopy class was 41-70%, except within 0.1 km of nests, where >70% canopy predominated. Nesting spotted owls selected areas with denser canopy than randomly available forest landscapes, but outside the immediate nest area (>0.8 km) canopy closure approached that of the surrounding forest.

AB  - Adults of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana express striking phenotypic plasticity. A wet season form has conspicuous marginal eyespots and a medial pale band which are much reduced in the dry season form. These alternative forms are produced after rearing at high or low temperatures, respectively. We used 'window' experiments involving switching of larvae and pupae between high and low temperatures at different stages during development to examine the timing of sensitivity to environmental temperature. The final, fifth larval instar is shown to be especially sensitive. The fourth larval instar and the very early pupal period are also sensitive. It is argued that an increasing sensitivity during growth is ecologically adaptive since the late larval environment will be the most accurate predictor for the adult environment in which the wing phenotype is subject to selection. The period of sensitivity is not as short as a few days. This may minimize the chance of any 'mistakes' in matching the adult phenotype to the season because of short-term environmental fluctuations during the larval period. The observed sensitivity occurs as late as possible during growth since the wing pattern is developmentally determined at the end of the early part of the pupal stage.

AB  - Studies of the evolution of diversity in colour pattern or morphology have seldom included any analysis of the developmental processes involved in translating genetic variation into the phenotypes influenced by natural selection. This gap is being filled by research on eyespot patterns in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. This review discusses how data on the developmental genetics of eyespot traits can help in the description and analysis of evolutionary constraints.

AB  - This paper investigates first the performance of a rotating disk microfiltration system, described by the mean permeate flux as a function of particle concentration, disk rotation speed and peripheral transmembrane pressure (TMP), using suspensions of calcium carbonate particles. The second part presents the radial distribution of permeate flux and filtration resistance obtained by using concentric membrane rings and their relationship with local shear stress and TMP. Our data confirm that high shear stresses induced by the disk rotation prevent the formation of a cake on the membrane except in the central part at low speed. Consequently, this system is capable of maintaining high permeate fluxes (200lh-1m-2) at large particle concentrations (700kgm-3). At speeds above 1100rpm, the permeate flux increases with radius above 4cm and fouling disappears almost completely in the peripheral zone. The local flux in the central zone reaches a plateau when TMP is increased above 35kPa, while it keeps increasing with pressure in other zones. The filtration resistance was found to increase linearly with local TMP in all zones, but at a lesser rate in peripheral ones. Fouling irreversibility was observed when reducing rotation speed, especially at high TMP. We conclude that this system is very efficient in case of external fouling when used at disk tip velocities above 12ms-1. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The spermatozoa of Potamon fluviatile and P. ibericum are virtually indistinguishable and do not support separate subgeneric rank (Potamon and Pontipotamon, respectively). Synapomorphic with the spermatozoa of the South African freshwater crab Potamonautes perlatus sidneyi are the elongation of the two centrioles and disposition of the centrioles almost parallel to each other, unknown elsewhere in the Brachyura, and reduction of the thickened ring (homoplasic with grapsids and gecarcinids). Other, probably synapomorphic, similarities of Potamon and Potamonautes include the wide inner acrosome zone, absence of a definite acrosome ray zone (homoplasic in other families) and the cleistospermial spermatophores. Further similarities, of questionable polarity, are the simple, not multilaminar, nuclear membrane and the tendency of the nuclear arms to wrap around the nucleus. Differences of Potamon from Potamonautes, which possibly support their present generic separation and give weak support to their former separate familial placement in the Potamidae and Potamonautidae respectively, are perforation of the operculum and the weak, rather than strong, development of a periopercular rim. Absence in Potamon and Potamonautes of an accessory opercular ring and a xanthid ring separates them from xanthids. No close affinities with other heterotreme families are seen but their assignment to the Heterotremata is not in doubt. Their spermatozoa lack two of the distinctive features of thoracotreme spermatozoa (apical button on the operculum and concentric lamellation of the outer acrosome zone). No clear correlates of spermatozoon structure with a freshwater existence are recognizable but reduction of the thickened ring possibly relates to peculiarities of the acrosome reaction. However, the production of spermatophores with single spermatozoa (cleistospermia) is possibly a device to prevent polyspermy and wastage of the small number of lecithotrophic eggs produced in potamids.

AB  - The diagnosis of malingering and functional visual loss should be proven by specific tests- after the exclusion of differential diagnoses such as optical disturbances, amblyopia, early stages of macula and optic nerve disease and cortical lesions. Malingering and functional visual loss are based on different causes and pathogenetic mechanisms. However, they produce the same symptoms and can therefore be examined by the same methods. The strategy consists of three parts: 1) check the reproducability of the results, 2) specific procedures: provocation of reflectory responses, deception, measurement of the same function with different methods and objective methods and 3) proof. In alleged bilateral blindness the provocation of reflexes and deceptive strategies are especially useful, in alleged bilateral reduction of visual acuity deceptive methods (related to the size of the optotype), the examination of central vision by other methods (equivalents to visual acuity) and objective methods are applied. In alleged monolateral blindness or reduction of visual acuity the binocular tests are valuable. Additionally, methods to provoke reflexes, especially pupil reaction, are used as well as the measure of equivalents to visual acuity. In alleged concentric constriction of the visual fields three strategies are mainly used: 1) check if visual field size is in accordance with the visual angle, 2) different methods to examine the isopters and 3) different perimetric methods. In case of an alleged hemianopic field defect the following methods are of special value: 1) binocular examination, 2) reading ability, 3) different perimetric methods and 4) half-field stimulation. After finishing the specific tests the diagnosis of malingering or functional visual loss should be unambiguous and the existing function should be determined. Strategies for further management are shown - dependent on the pathogenesis: the aim is to avoid repetition and to set the right course for the future. In cases of malingering the reliable expert's report is helpful. In case of functional visual loss it is important to avoid unnecessary examinations and to offer specific aids.

AB  - Objectives. Supplemental myocardial hypertrophy induced by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 may prevent transition from hypertrophy to heart failure under chronic mechanical overload. Background. Several studies have suggested that IGF-1 treatment may be beneficial in chronic heart failure. In addition, recent studies indicated that the amount of a-myosin heavy chain (MHC) plays a significant hemodynamic role in large animals including humans. Methods. We treated Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats on a long-term basis with IGF-1. The effects were compared with those produced by treatment using a sub-antihypertensive dose of temocapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. At 11 weeks, when these rats displayed compensated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), they were randomized to three groups: 1) IGF group (3 mg/kg/day); 2) temocapril group (1 mg/kg/day); and 3) vehicle (control) group. Results. After 15 weeks, the control rats showed left ventricular (LV) enlargement and severe LV dysfunction and rapidly died of pulmonary congestion (mean survival time: 16.8 ± 0.5 weeks). The survival time was significantly shortened (15.6 ± 0.3 weeks) in the IGF-1 group but significantly prolonged (19.5 ± 0.6 weeks) in the temocapril group. The rats in the IGF-1 group showed accelerated LV dilation and dysfunction. Of the several parameters investigated, it was found that the relative amounts of MHC isoforms differed among the three groups. The α-MHC mRNA level was decreased by 52% (p < 0.01) in the IGF group, while it increased by 58% (p < 0.01) in the temocapril group compared with the control group. These changes were related to the progression of LV dysfunction. Conclusions. Supplemental myocardial hypertrophy with long-term IGF-1 treatment may not be beneficial if concentric LVH already exists. Our data suggest that IGF-1 may not protect myocardial performance when its hypertrophic effect aggravates the reduction of α-MHC. By contrast, the ACE inhibitor may improve myocardial function and prognosis by preventing the down-regulation of this isoform. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.

AB  - Visual field defects without any organic correlate require critical control to avoid inadequate management of psychogenic defects. Which methods are promising to detect psychogenic visual field defects? Twenty ophthalmologically trained volunteers motivated to pretend a concentric visual field loss were tested by manual perimetry with centripetal and centrifugal movement of the stimulus, by evoking saccadic eye movements towards a stimulus outside the subjectively claimed visual field and by observation of the volunteers' strategy searching a stimulus beyond the subjectively claimed borders. Malingering could be proven in 16 persons. The most favourable procedure is to evoke eye movements towards a peripheral stimulus. These movements yield information about the visual field outside the subjectively stated limits.

AB  - 1. Larvae from eggs of fifteen wild-caught speckled wood females were reared individually under common conditions (LD 18:6 h and 17 °C) in the laboratory. 2. Pupal colour (green or brown) and the following adult morphological variables that are known or assumed to be related to behavioural variation (thermoregulation, flight, crypsis) were studied: size, relative thorax mass, area of yellow patches on the dorsal forewing, size of submarginal eyespots on the dorsal hindwing, colour of the dorsal thorax, dorsal basal wing, and dorsal distal wing. 3. The results of the breeding experiment indicate significant differences in adult morphological traits among families, sexes, and pupal colour types. 4. All adult morphological variables (except spot size and thorax colouration) differed significantly among families, suggesting genetic variation underlying the phenotypic variation. Heritabilities for these features were intermediate (0.38) to high (> 1). 5. Apart from known aspects (e.g. size), novel aspects of the sexual dimorphism were found: females had paler thoraxes than males, which relates to higher abundance of fur on the thorax and hence to thermoregulatory differences. 6. Green pupae produced larger individuals with a larger relative thorax mass than brown pupae. Green pupae produced adults with a paler basal wing colour in females, but not in males. These relationships are novel and suggest a trade-off between juvenile and adult investment.

AB  - Turbulent flow in concentric and eccentric annuli is numerically simulated as part of an investigation aimed at modeling drilled cuttings transport in wellbores. A numerical code is developed to solve the time-averaged momentum equation wherein the Reynolds stresses are modeled using the eddy viscosity approach. A nonorthogonal curvilinear, boundary-fitted coordinate system is used to facilitate the implementation of boundary conditions. Several turbulence models, including a one-layer mixing length model developed as part of this study, a two-layer mixing-length model, and a low Reynolds number, two-equation (k-τ) model are used to simulate turbulent flow in several concentric and eccentric annuli. Performance of these turbulence models is evaluated by comparing numerical predictions to experimental data obtained from several sources. Results show that the proposed one-layer mixing length model performs as well as the two-layer mixing length model and the two-equation model while avoiding some of the difficulties associated with the implementation of these models. © 1998 by ASME.

AB  - The potential for pheromone-based mating disruption of eye-spotted bud moth (ESBM), Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in apple orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia was examined in small-plot trials. In a preliminary experiment, treatment of the orchard atmosphere with a 99:1 blend of Z8-tetradecenyl acetate (Z8-14:OAc) and Z8-tetradecenyl alcohol (Z8-14:OH) completely inhibited captures of male ESBM in pheromone-baited traps, but treatment with Z8-14:OAc alone did not. Therefore, all subsequent trials used the two-component blend as a disruptant. Mean catches of male ESBM in traps baited with 0.1, 1, 10, or 20 mg of 99:1 Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH were significantly reduced (81-97%) in pheromone-treated plots relative to similar traps placed in control plots. In both control and treated plots, there was a significant positive relationship between trap bait dose and trap catch. In pheromone-treated plots, this suggests that high doses of trap baits override the camouflage effect of disruption or overcome the effect of sensory adaptation and habituation. The number of virgin-female baited traps capturing at least one male ESBM was reduced by 96%, and mating of virgin females on mating tables was reduced by 95% in plots treated with the two-component pheromone. The total amount of Z8-14:OAc released from pheromone disruption dispensers during the latter field trials was estimated to average 6.4 g ha-1 over 11 days or 26.4 mg ha-1 h-1. The low levels of Z8-14:OH released from disruption dispensers could not be estimated by GC analysis. Dispensers loaded with a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH were highly attractive to males in baited traps, indicating that they have the potential to induce false trail following.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the contact condition, between impacting hammer and oiled anvil. To estimate the contact condition during impact, the anvil sputtered with gold film was used. Oil film break down was evaluated by a electric resistance method. It was found that the pattern of impact prints left on a sputtered Au film were roughly divided into three kinds, a circle pattern, concentric circles pattern and random pattern. The ratio of diameter of impact print that seemed white to that of Hertzian contact circle was fairly small as compared with the dry contact condition. The squeeze film prevents from metallic contact according to the oil property. Most oils showed perfect separation due to the existence of squeeze film. As far as the relation between oil film breakdown and the kind of pattern is concerned, oil film breakdown is likely to occur when a circle pattern was recognized. © 1999, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The commercially available Schwind-excimer-laser has been equipped with an additional device, the 'Excimer Laser Corneal Shaping system', that allows a variable UV-laser preparation of donor corneas. The technique has been developed some years ago in a collaboration between the Institute for General Physics, Vienna University of Technology and the Second Department of Ophthalmology. With its use both, lenticules for planolamellar keratoplasty and refractive epikeratoplasty, as well as donor buttons for penetrating keratoplasty can be designed and cut according to the surgeons specifications. Recent laboratory results showed an excellent quality of the centrally ablated surface as well as surface of the penetrating cut with only narrow concentric 'notches' corresponding to the lathing steps starting close to the central area. Higher stromal magnification on TEM revealed a damage zone of less than 0.3 μm in close approximation to the treated surface. The resulting thickness revealed a difference of less than ± 53 μm from the intended value (measured by using contact ultrasound pachymetry). In penetrating keratoplasty, where the shape, the diameter and the cutting angle can be chosen independently, ultrastructural studies showed the perpendicular stromal surface to be smooth with a minimal protrusion of Descemet's membrane. Endothelial injury was only observed in a narrow zone of about 50 μm adjacent to the cutting edge. The ELCS-system will offer a considerable improvement for the preparation of corneal grafts when compared to presently available techniques like the cryolathe, the mikrokeratome or rotorkeratome, because it can avoid mechanical damage to the donor cornea and potentially allows for a much higher precision.

AB  - Recent advances in our understanding of developmental phenomena has come from highly interdisciplinary studies where molecular biology, ecology and evolution converge to elucidate fundamental mechanisms, how they change through time, and what function they actually have in the context of the niche of the organism. A recent study on butterfly eyespots pinpoints the surprisingly simple regulatory cascade controlling such an apparently complex phenotype. The implications go beyond the elucidation of a fascinating developmental pathway, into the mechanisms and tempo of speciation and macroevolution.

AB  - Eupyrene and apyrene spermatozoa are contained in separate cysts in the testis of the butterfly Atrophaneura alcinous. Spermatozoa of both types from various parts of the male reproductive tract were examined with particular reference to their morphological characteristics. All spermatozoa collected from the vas deferens and the vesicula seminalis were found to be immotile under a dissecting microscope. No spermatozoa of either type were recognized in any part of the ejaculatory duct. Within the testis, eupyrene spermatozoa are present in bundles and each spermatozoon has a slender nucleus with an acrosome and a long flagellum containing mitochondrial derivatives. Two kinds of appendages, lacinate and reticular, are present on the surface of the sperm membrane. They are replaced with an extracellular sheath during passage through the vas deferens. In contrast, apyrene spermatozoa have neither nucleus nor acrosome, whereas a cup-shaped structure was found at the sperm tip instead of the acrosome. Unlike eupyrene spermatozoa, they are surrounded by a concentric sheath outside the sperm membrane in the vas deferens. Individual apyrene spermatozoa and coiled bundles of eupyrene spermatozoa were both found to accumulate in the vesicula seminalis before mating. These morphological changes during passage through the male reproductive tract suggests the occurrence of a kind of maturation and capacitation process reminiscent of mammalian spermatozoa. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Blemishing is a major quality defect of persimmon both in Australia and New Zealand. Several studies were conducted on the incidence and development of blemish in 4 well-managed orchards in both countries. Over 10 different types of blemishing were identified and documented. Of the blemishes identified, wind rub caused the greatest reduction in marketable fruit. The occurrence of this disorder was 5 times higher in Australia than in New Zealand in spite of windrun in New Zealand being 2-2.5 time higher than in Australia. The lower incidence of wind rub in New Zealand appears to be due to the use of Y trellising, whereas, in Australia, trees are free-standing. The incidence of sunburn varied markedly with season. The incidence of this disorder was reduced by bird-netting (5-15% shade factor) which is the standard management practise in Australia. Line, apex and concentric cracking were minor problems in most orchards. Methods for controlling blemishing in commercial orchards are outlined.

AB  - Suites of stratigraphic units which act together as relatively strong and weak horizons within the Western Foothills fold and thrust belt can be recognized in the Miaoli-Wenshui and Chiayi-Alishan areas. Through combining field observations, theorical considerations and laboratory tests, it has been determined that the influence of the strength of individual units to the development of geological structures is less important than the relative strength of a package of suites that deformed coherently. This result is consistent with the concept of structural lithic unit which has been successfully applied to understand the structural style in different tectonic regimes. The difference in the structural style of the Western Foothills fold and thrust belt between the Miaoli-Wenshui and the Chiayi-Alishan areas are observed through published geological maps. More thrusts and thrust-related folds are seen in the Miaoli-Wenshui area but more buckling folds are observed in the Chiayi-Alishan area at the same scale. In comparison with the distributions of structural lithic units in these two areas, the difference in the structural style seemingly can be attributed to the variation in the distribution of structural lithic units within these two areas. Three structural lithic units which progress from older to younger and are temporarily named A, B, and C are identified in the Western Foothills on both the Miaoli-Wenshui and Chiayi-ALishan areas according to the published geological maps and field observation of mesoscopic structures. Structural lithic unit A is primarily composed of interbedded, well-cemented sandstones and shales. Small scaled chevron folds with wavelengths of tens of meters to hundreds of meters is the most conspicuous deformed feature in this unit. Unit B mainly consists of thick-bedded to massive, well cemented sandstones with thin- to thick-bedded shale. Thrusts and thrust-related asymmetric folds are the dominant structures in unit B. Unit C mainly consists of thick-bedded to massive, poorly cemented sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, and shales. Concentric folds with wavelengths over hundreds of meters is the major structure in unit C. In the Miaoli-Wenshui area, the Lower Miocene strata belongs to unit A, the Upper Miocene strata belongs to unit B, and the Plioi-Pleistocene strata belongs to unit C. In the Chiayi-Alishan area, the exposed Middle Miocene Nankang Formation and the Lower part of the Upper Miocene Nanchuang Formation belong to unit A, the Upper part of the Nanchuang Formation and the Lower Mio-Pliocene Kueichulin Formation belong to unit B, and the Plio-Pleistocene strata belongs to unit C. Since there are more rocks of structural lithic unit B exposed in the Miaoli-Wenshui area, than in the Chiayi-Alishan area, more thrusts and thrust-related folds are observed. In contrast, more rocks of structural lithic unit A are exposed in the Chiayi-Alishan area and small scaled bucling folds become dominant deformed structures.

AB  - A project considered as an opportunity to explore design ideals of the embodied approach is carried. Three different approaches to achieving full coverage for a given room are considered. One approach utilizes genetic programming to generate an algorithm that effectively vacuums the room, while the other two focus on designing behaviors for the robot to traverse the floor in a pre-specified pattern (the North/South and Concentric Squares method). The plan is to compare these three approaches in a variety of room environments to measure their relative utilities.

AB  - State-of-the-art of LAN cable technologies cannot avoid wire defects like eccentricity. The lack of concentricity and some wire oscillation degrades the channel quality due to loss, interference and signal reflections. This paper studies the effect of the backtwisting process on improving the electrical response of cable at high frequencies.

AB  - An outbreak of Spirama retorta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), affecting 800 ha of a one-year-old Acacia mangium plantation, occurred in May to October 1992 in Gunung Besaut Forest Reserve, Perak, Peninsular Malaysia. In the laboratory, more than 60% of larvae reared on A. mangium leaves reached adult stage. Development from egg to adult took 42 days through seven instars requiring 27 days. The moth was medium - sized, having red abdomen and an eyespot on its forewing. The female (x̄ = 64.4 mm), bigger than the male, had greyish-orange forewings with prominent eyespots. The male(x̄ = 58.8 mm) had dark brown to almost black forewings with less conspicuous eyespots. The life table parameters recorded from laboratory population were: the net reproductive rate (Ro) of 203.2, the mean generation time (Tc) of 43.3 days, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of 0.1 and the doubling time of 5.6 days. Results from biweekly sampling showed that the infestation, indicated by the number of trees with larvae, varied from 30% at the beginning of the study, rose to more than 60% in the fourth week and dropped to less than 10% at the end of the fourteenth week. Three tachinids, Carcelia sp., Exorista sp. and Blepharella sp., emerged from field collected larvae. Larval-pupal mortality due to parasitism was 5.6 - 43.3%. Predators, Sycanus leucomesus (Reduviidae), Cantheconidea furcellata (Pentatomidae), Mallada basalis (Chrysopidae) and Vespa affinis indosinensis (Vespidae) were observed feeding on the larvae.

AB  - Olive leaf spot, peacock spot, and bird's eye spot are names for the wide-spread disease of olives caused by the fungus Spilocea oleaginea. The symptoms of the disease are dark green or black circular spots, that develop mainly on the leaf blades. A complete loss of yield of some sensitive cultivars can occur in certain climatic regions. In the present study, progeny from a population segregating for resistance to peacock disease were obtained from a breeding program in Israel. The DNA from a sample of this population was examined for a resistance marker using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) in conjunction with the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Two DNA bulks were constructed, each derived from 15 progeny showing either tolerance or susceptibility for the disease. About 100 random sequence Operon primers were used to screen for polymorphisms between the two bulks, and those primers that produced polymorphic PCR products between the two bulks were repeatedly tested for consistency. Where a consistent polymorphism was produced, all parents and progeny were tested individually for the presence of the polymorphism. Of the 100 primers screened, two showed polymorphic bands between the two bulks. One of those produced a marker that was found in about 80% of both parents and progeny showing tolerance for peacock spot disease.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana has a series of distal eyespots on its wings. Each eyespot is composed of a white pupil, a black disc, and a gold outer ring. We applied artificial selection to the large dorsal eyespot on the forewing to produce a line with the gold ring reduced or absent (BLACK) and another line with a reduced black disc and a broad gold ring (GOLD). High heritabilities, coupled with a rapid response to selection, produced two lines of butterflies with very different phenotypes. Other eyespots showed a correlated change in the proportion of their color rings. Surgical experiments were performed on pupal wings from the different lines at the time of eyespot pattern specification. They showed that the additive genetic variance for this trait was in the response of the wing epidermis to signaling from the organizing cells at the eyespot center (the focus). This response was found to vary across different regions of the wing and also between the sexes. The particular eyespot color composition found for each sex, as well as the maintenance of the high genetic variation, are discussed with reference to the ecology of the butterfly, sexual selection, and visual selection by predators.

AB  - In 1994, Shell Canada Ltd. converted several deep sour gas wells from dual to single completions using a snubbing unit and service rig in order to commingle production and to improve gas deliverability. The wells are commingled by opening sliding sleeves or perforating the inner string, but an opportunity was identified in many wells to enhance deliverability and accelerate reserve production by the removing the inner concentric tubing string, allowing the commingled production to flow up the larger outer tubing string alone.

AB  - In a temporarily abandoned offshore well, bubbles were escaping and that reservoir pressure were migrating under the surface the temporary abandonment (TA) cap. A pressure control team was called in to solve the problem. The team designed a means of pressure investigation that relied on hydraulic snubbing equipment and well control expertise. The team designed an elaborate surface blowout preventers stack that included dual overboard diverters and a pressure-confining tubing string which latched mechanically to the TA cap.

AB  - Arthopyrenia aloës Kainz, Aptroot & Triebel, a new fungus from Namibia, growing on bark of Aloë dichotoma Masson, is described as new to science. The species is characterized by a conspicuous habit, of dark concentric spots on the silver-coloured bark of the host plant. A. aloës has features close to members of the genera Arthopyrenia A. Massal. and Didymella Sacc. Its generic placement is discussed and similarities to Stigmidium Trevis. are pointed out. A. aloës is regarded as a member of the genus Arthopyrenia, mainly because of its ascus and ascospore features and the presence of both periphyses and cellular pseudoparaphyses.

AB  - We use multichannel seismic reflection profiles to determine the seismic stratigraphy of the flexural moat that flanks the Canary Islands. The moat stratigraphy has been divided into 5 units on the basis of internal character and correlation of distinctive reflections. The deepest units, I and II, which well-ties indicate are Eocene and older, thicken towards the east suggesting they are the consequence of sediment loading at the Moroccan continental margin. Units III, IV and V, which are Oligocene and younger and highly reflective, thicken concentrically around individual islands suggesting they are dominantly the result of volcanic loading. Distinct stratigraphic patterns of onlap at the base and offlap at the top of individual flexural units are seen on the across-moat profiles but they were not easily identified on our limited along-moat profiles. The thickness of the upper three units is in accord with the predictions of flexural loading models. Moreover, a model in which the volcanoes that make up the Canary Islands progressively load the underlying lithosphere from east to west generally accounts for the thickness variations that are observed in the region of individual islands. We date the shield building stages of the Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and La Gomera as Oligocene to Early Miocene, that of Tenerife as Middle Miocene to Late Miocene and those of La Palma and El Hierro as Pliocene to Quaternary. The best overall fit to stratigraphic data in the northern moat is for an elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te, of 35 km, which is similar to the 30-40 km which would be expected for Oligocene and Neogene loading of Jurassic oceanic lithosphere. There is evidence that a contribution from the margin is required to explain the divergence of Units III, IV and V along the Moroccan margin. Detailed modelling of an along-strike seismic profile of the moat north of Tencrife and Gran Canaria, however, suggests that flexure due to island loading fully explains the stratigraphic patterns that are observed and does not require an additional contribution from the margin. The most likely explanation for this observation is that a 'barrier' had developed by the Oligocene, along the present trend of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, which prevented sediments from the Moroccan margin infilling the northern parts of the moats caused by volcanic loading. Furthermore, there is evidence from differences in the thickness of Units I and II that a barrier may also have existed prior to the Oligocene which protected the northern basin from corrosive bottom currents that removed large amounts of late Cretaceous and Palaeogene age material from the southern basin.

AB  - To evaluate differences in shoulder strength and range of motion between painful and pain-free shoulders we examined two matched groups of athletes. Fifteen competitive swimmers were allocated to two groups. Group 1 consisted of seven swimmers with unilateral shoulder pain related to swimming (Neer and Welsh phase I to II). The control group (Group 2) consisted of eight swimmers with no present or previous history of shoulder pain. Concentric and eccentric internal rotational torques were reduced in painful shoulders in between-group comparisons as well as in side-to-side comparisons. The decrease in internal rotational torque resulted in significantly greater concentric and eccentric external-to-internal rotational strength ratios of the painful shoulder in Group 1 swimmers compared with the controls. Furthermore, the functional ratio (eccentric external rotation:concentric internal rotation) was significantly greater in the painful shoulder in both between-group and side-to-side comparisons. Both groups of swimmers exhibited increased external range of motion and reduced internal range of motion compared with normalized data, but no between-group or side-to-side differences were detected. Our findings suggest that prevention or rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder might not solely involve strengthening of the external rotators of the shoulder joint. Attention might also be drawn toward correction of a possible deficit in internal rotational strength. Changes in shoulder range of motion seem unrelated to the occurrence of shoulder pain.

AB  - In the previous reports, the author proposed a new system, named the Workpiece-Referred Form Accuracy Control System (WORFAC), and confirmed an effectiveness of this method. In the 3rd to 5th reports, this method was applied to the cylindrical turning by an ordinary lathe and it was found that the WORFAC is useful to improve the cutting accuracy of ordinary lathe and that the simulation and experiment are well consistent. In this report, the WORFAC is applied to face turning and obtained following results: (1) The offset of a sensor in the cutting direction can be heaped up and it may cause to make some errors. It can be avoided if the cutting control is started at the time when a sensor and a tool reach on the same concentric circle on the workpiece surface. (2) Let xg, yg are two dimensional offsets of the sensor from the cutting point on the workpiece surface as xg for the feed direction. The form accuracy is getting better as yg is bigger for the area of xg>yg. (3) At the area of yg≥xg, being yg smaller, the form is better. The best position is yg = xg.

AB  - Spilled - dyevat works in non - continuous mode. Its technological process is composed of putting in cloth, adding dyestuff, heating dye - liquor, cooling dye - liquor and rinsing, and each process stage has different temperature control curve. The purposes of the design are to realize time sharing control for multi - spilled - dyevats and to implement dyeing formula presetting and choosing. The time sharing control of multi - spilled - dyevats means that one PLC controls many spilled - dyevats in different time. The presetting and choosing of dyeing formulas means that many dyeing formulas are preset in PLC and that the monitor computer chooses different formula according to different technological process. The concentric issue of the dyeing formulas of multi - spilled - dyevat prevents the operation from mistaking in dyeing process and improves product quality. This paper introduces the hardware configuration of the multi - spilled - dyevat control system, the control software, the picture configuration and the running - result of the system.

AB  - In the southeastern United States, major emphasis in forest management is directed toward increased timber production. If wildlife management and increased timber production are to coexist, relationships between wildlife habitat preferences and silvicultural practices must be better understood. Previous research on woodland hawks determined that nest site selection occurs at a microhabitat level. However, it is difficult for a land manager to select for habitat characteristics on a small scale. It is more practical to design management schemes that aim for critical macrohabitat types. In 1994, 12 red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) and 10 red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) nests were located on a 5000-ha wildlife management area in the Georgia Piedmont. Nest site macrohabitat preferences were examined using a geographic information system (GIS). Hardwood habitat was separated into upland and bottomland macrohabitat types, and pine habitat was separated by age and structural characteristics into six macrohabitat types. Using the GIS, three concentric circles of increasing size were created around each nest. Macrohabitat percentages within each concentric circle were compared to total percentages available on the study area. Circle macrohabitats that occurred in higher proportions than expected based on total availability were considered critical.

AB  - Bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus) are patchily distributed on two dominant spatial scales: (1) geographically restricted to highly saline marine lagoons, and (2) locally abundant within such lagoons only in relatively discrete beds of seagrass habitat. In the Cape Lookout lagoonal system of North Carolina, adult bay scallop abundance in the most densely occupied seagrass bed (Oscar Shoal) exhibits repeatable declines from up to 70 m-2 to near zero in a 2- to 4-week period during late summer. This crash is completed before fall spawning can be initiated, thereby creating a population sink in what is the singly most productive patch of habitat. Field experiments conducted in the summers of 1996 and 1998 demonstrated that the seasonal extinction of bay scallops on Oscar Shoal can be prevented by the erection of 1-m2 stockades, made of 50-cm-high vertical poles, spaced every 25 cm, which inhibit access by cownose rays. Because these stockades were porous to emigration and physical transport, and open to access by all other predators of adult scallops, predation by migrating cownose rays is the only viable explanation for the crash. Consequently, the natural predation process in this system achieves the reproductive extinction of prey in the habitat patch of highest productivity. Over 7 years of observation, the mortality rate in this patch increased with summer density, reaching the asymptote of 100% at 10 m-2. The site-specific habitat selection by schools of rays may be based on prey density, which could render this example representative of a widespread generator of population sinks in habitat patches of high quality. The virtual extinction of scallops within Oscar Shoal despite nearby patches with relatively high density may be related to the highly efficient feeding behavior of schools and the high vulnerability of bay scallops in a context of multiple alternative prey types.

AB  - Surface mapping, deep borehole intersections and geophysical data indicate the existence of a conspicuous set of spatially and genetically related structural forms, centered around the town of Vredefort in South Africa. The structure consists of a central granitic core, surrounded by concentrically arranged folds and faults that affect strata of sedimentary and volcanic origin. It is demonstrated that the structure conforms to that of the root zone of a multi-ring impact basin. "Vredefort-related" characteristics, typical of structures of this kind, are highlighted and brought into their evolutionary perspective. Impact occurred at the end of the period of igneous activity that marked the emplacement of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, approximately 2000 Ma ago. Most traces of a stage of modification of the original transient crater were removed by erosion and the remnant structural forms reflect mainly the effects of centripetally outward directed, horizontally orientated stress. The morphology of the structure was eventually modified by later tectonic movement, and isostatic adjustment.

AB  - A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of unstable angina pectoris. There was a discrete and concentric 90% stenotic lesion at proximal RCA on coronary angiogram. PTCA was carried out on the lesion by means of a cutting balloon (Barath, IV T co'ltd) 3. 75 mm in diameter, and 15 mm long. During the first inflation, the balloon ruptured and the pressure of the indeflator decreased suddenly. Then the large dissection from proxymal to the distal segment of RCA was shown in the X-ray image and followed by acute occlusion. The first Palmaz-Schatz stent was implanted towards the entry of the dissection, but the long dissection could not be tacked up by only one stent and perfusion of the distal RCA was decreased. Then the second stent was implanted towards the distal end of the dissection, in order to prevent the distal progression of the dissection. The last stent was implanted in the mid -portion of the dissection, and post-dilation was performed after each stent implantation. Finally, successful emergency alleviation was obtained. There was no occurrence of subacute stent thrombosis. After the procedure, the cutting balloon was examined and a pin -hole rupture was found.

AB  - This article discusses the shift from crime as a problem of the police and judicial authorities to a subject of local policy. It will, in particular, examine the relationship between safety policy and social policy. Safety has become an important social theme in the last decades. There are at least three reasons to explain why this is the case: the increase of crime, increased attention for the victim and the legitimacy of the government. A concentric model is proposed to serve the development of a systematically set up local safety policy. In the Netherlands programmes such as Communities that Care and Justice in the neighbourhood (Jib) are important developments which stress the integral approach of the crime and safety problem. The article closes with a discussion on the convergence of criminal justice policy and social policy. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The ultrastructure of the seminal vesicle's spermatozoa of the butterfly Euptoieta hegesia was analyzed. The apyrene spermatozoa measure about 300 μm in length and swim freely in a secretion. The anterior end consists in a cap with a cylindrical extension and a globular structure. The flagellum has a 9+9+2 axoneme, two mitochondrial derivatives with paracrystalline matrices and an external coat formed by concentric layers. The eupyrene spermatozoa measure about 550 μm in length and are grouped into bundles. The anterior end consists in an amorphous globule. Posterior to this globule, a coat with a dense material covers the spermatozoon where an acrosome and a nucleus appear. The flagellum has a 9+9+2 axoneme and two mitochondrial derivatives. External to the coat and attached to the dense material, there is a reticular appendage, which has a paracrystalline core and extends to the distal tip of the spermatozoon. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

AB  - About three decades ago, a formerly unknown genetic type of natural diamonds was discovered in impact craters. Impact diamonds are currently known from a number of impact structures in Europe, Asia and North America, and it's likely that the number of finds will increase with time. The Popigai crater, Northern Siberia, where impact diamonds were first found, was specifically investigated in terms of geology, geophysics, petrography and mineralogy. Large resources of industrial impact diamonds were discovered, and these minerals were studied in detail. Authigenic impact diamonds occur in situ in shocked graphite-bearing gneisses that are found as inclusions in impact melt rocks: tagamites and suevites. According to the observed transformation of coexisting minerals, the lower estimated pressure of the coherent martensite transition of graphite to diamonds is 35 GPa. Impact diamonds inherit the original shape of graphite crystals and are composed of a polycrystalline structured aggregate of cubic and probably hexagonal carbon microcrystals 1-5 μm across. Numerous properties of diamonds depend on the high density of defects in the crystal lattice. Allothigenic impact diamonds occur in rocks produced by the homogenization and solidification of impact melt, which originated from the complete fusion of graphite-bearing precursor gneisses. These diamonds usually reflect the influence of the hot melt and are strongly corroded. Diamond-bearing tagamites and suevites in the Popigai crater interior occur as extended lens and sheets bodies and also as irregular small bodies. Diamond distribution depends on the original abundance of precursor graphite in the target rocks, on the superimposed shock-metamorphic zonation, and on the character of the ejection of shocked and melted material along different trajectories and azimuths. This has resulted in radial and concentric inhomogeneities in diamond distribution in the crater interior. On a second order, the distribution depends on the scale of melt contamination by clasts and fragments and by the duration of cooling of certain melt bodies and their constituents. Enrichment in diamonds at the margins of thick tagamite sheets is the result of rapid cooling, which prevents combustion of diamonds. A positive correlation between diamond content and the amount of phosphorus pentoxide in impactites indicates links to C and P probably in organic matter of the primary sedimentary rocks, which were subjected to granulitic metamorphism 2.4 Ga ago and melted at the time of impact 35.7 Ma ago.

AB  - All butterfly eyespots appear to be formed by a similar developmental mechanism. Thus the great diversity of patterns observed across different species of butterfly has evolved through changes in the genetic modulation of this mechanism. Our descriptions of both the development of eyespots and the genetic variation for eyespot traits in an African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, are used here to discuss the most appropriate ways of applying the character concept to the evolution of butterfly eyespot patterns. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Two isosporan species are described from the feces of the ocellated woodcreeper, Xiphorhynchus ocellatus (Passeriformes: Dendrocolaptidae) collected in Ecuador. Isospora ocellatisp. n. sporulated oocysts are ovoidal, double-layered, 20×17 (18-21×15-19) urn with one polar body and no micropyle or residuum. The sporocysts are ovoidal, 12×8 (11-13×7-9) urn with dome-shaped Stieda bodies, compressed, bubble-shaped substieda bodies, and usually scattered residuum. Sporozoites are sausage-shaped with central nucleus and posterior' refractile body. Isospora striata sp. n. oocysts are ovoidal, double-layered, 18×16 (16-20×15-17) urn with one polar body and no micropyle or residuum. The sporocysts are ovoidal 11×7 (11-12×7-8) urn with nipple-shaped Stieda bodies, rectangular-shaped substieda bodies, and spherical, compact, residuum. Sporozoites are elongate, tapered anteriorly with large posterior refractile body, small central nucleus, and concentric rings around anterior half of body. © by Gustav Fischer Verlag.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to measure arterial blood pressure with the Finaprestm noninvasive, continuous blood pressure monitor (FBPM) to characterize the continuous blood pressure response during three sets of a 10-repetition maximum double-leg press exercise. Seven recreational weight lifters volunteered for this study. Preliminary sessions determined the 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) for the double-leg press. Subjects lifted to a metronome cadence and were coached to avoid the Valsalva maneuver. During the experimental session, subjects were instrumented for blood pressure measurements by the FBPM. The FBPM used a cuff placed on the middle finger of the right hand, which was maintained at heart level. Subjects completed three sets of 10-RM lifts. Similar to previously reported studies using blood pressure via intra-arterial canulation: within a single repetition, peak pressure was developed as the legs initiated the concentric lift from the flexed position; lowest pressures were developed as the legs became fully extended, and the blood pressure increased with each successive repetition within a set. Additionally, blood pressure increased significantly with each subsequent set (peak systolic blood pressures: set 1- 238±18; set 2 - 268±18; set 3 - 293±21 mmHg). In conclusion, blood pressure responses to the leg press exercise increase with each repetition and also with each successive set, at least for three sets. Therefore, the highest pressures during the leg press were achieved as the lift was initiated from the flexed position, with further increases as repetition and set numbers increased.

AB  - A new spray chamber, termed a flushing spray chamber (FSC), has been developed for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry aimed at more rapid and reliable multi-element analyses of solution samples. The sample solutions are nebulized by a conventional concentric nebulizer and then directly aspirated into the glass chamber. A continuous flushing system within the glass chamber prevents long residence times of trapped sample droplets. The glass chamber used has single flow path configuration with smaller internal volume (about 50 mL) that avoids the stagnation of the sample aerosol inside the spray chamber. The combination of continuous washing and small stagnation times of the mist results in shorter washout time. Typical washout time for 1 μg g-1 concentrations of U and Hg are about 40 s and 200 s, respectively, and these are about 1/4 and 1/100 of the level of the typical washout time observed with a conventional spray chamber including the Scott- type spray chamber. In the case of Os, because of a serious memory effect, the washout time for 1 μg g-1 concentration of OsO4 solution could not be defined. Nevertheless, the washout time from 1 μg g-1 concentration of OsO4 solution could be remarkably reduced, to 150 s, and this is almost two orders of magnitude shorter than the washout time achieved by the conventional spray chamber. When chilled water (about 4 °C) is used within the flushing system, stability, sensitivity and oxide level show no significant differences between the normal and modified nebulizer system. The data presented here demonstrate clearly that the practical measurement time can be shortened by means of the FSC developed in this study.

AB  - The content of this manuscript is intended to assist the reader in collecting valid and reliable data for quantifying muscular strength and power. Various drawbacks and pitfalls of specific tests, as well as recommendations for the practitioner are also provided. The content is divided into sections covering isometric, isotonic, field tests, and isokinetic modes of exercise. Inherent in these modes are both concentric and eccentric muscle actions as well as both open and closed kinetic chain activities. For Isometric testing, contractions should occur over a four to five seconds duration with a one second transition period at the start of the contraction. At least one minute of rest should be provided between contractions. For each muscle tested at each position, at least three contractions should be performed although more may be performed if deemed necessary by the tester. For isotonic testing, the 1-RM test should be performed. After the general warm-up, the subject should perform a specific warm-up set of 8 repetitions at approximately 50% of the estimated 1-RM followed by another set of 3 repetitions at 70% of the estimated 1-RM. Subsequent lifts are single repetitions of progressively heavier weights until failure. Repeat until the 1-RM is determined to the desired level of precision. The rest interval between sets should be not less than one and not more than five minutes. The optimal number of single repetitions ranges from three to five. Data and guidelines of the following field tests are also provided; vertical jump, bench press, Wingate anaerobic cycle test (WAT), and the Margaria stair-run test. For isokinetic testing, details are provided for testing peak torque, work, power, endurance, and estimation of fiber type percentages.

AB  - The tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to wet-dry seasonality. The wet season form (WSF) has a conspicuous wing pattern with large eyespots, whereas the dry season form (DSF) lacks eyespots and therefore has a more cryptic appearance. Temperature is the main factor controlling this difference: rearing larvae at a low (< 19°C) temperature in the laboratory results in the DSF, whereas rearing at a high (> 23°C) temperature induces the WSF. We applied truncation selection in opposite directions in successive generations reared at two alternating temperatures (18.5°C and 23.5°C) to increase (for two High Plasticity (HP) lines), and decrease (for two Low Plasticity (LP) lines) wing pattern plasticity. Plasticity was assessed by partitioning full-sib families over four rearing temperatures (18.5°C, 20.5°C, 21.5°C and 23.5°C). Several wing pattern elements were measured for which the first principal component (PC1) provides a useful summary. The slopes of reaction norms for PC1 were significantly steeper in the HP lines than in the LP lines; however, the selection lines did not always differ significantly from the unselected stock. The results of crosses between the replicates of the selection lines gave no indication for effects of inbreeding. We argue that high, positive genetic correlations across temperatures retard a response to selection in opposite directions in different environments. This is discussed with respect to potential evolutionary constraints in natural populations in these butterflies.

AB  - The effect of 6 months of twice weekly karate training on flexibility, balance, and strength was evaluated in 14 boys who perform karate as beginners (age M = 10.3 ± 1.8) and a group of the same age who had never been involved in martial arts (n = 10; age M = 10.9 ± 1.4). All subjects were pretested and posttested on the following: flexibility of upper extremity (shoulder), hamstrings and quadriceps; strength, including handgrip strength and concentric flexion/extension of quadriceps; and balance, with eyes either open or closed. After 6 months, the tests were evaluated and compared by groups. The results showed the karate group made significant gains on quadriceps flexibility and balance with eyes closed. By improving flexibility, balance, and strength, karate improves three of the basic fitness components that are very important for preventing sport injuries in the growing years. © 1997 Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Sarcopenia associated with the normal aging process is often combined with the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle in older adults, leading to a significant reduction in reserve capacity of the neuromuscular system. A clear example of the aging effect is the pattern of reduction in muscle strength after the sixth decade for both isometric and concentric contractions. However, older adults are relatively stronger for movements in which muscles lengthen due to the inherent advantage of eccentric contractions, plus their stiffer muscle structures and prolonged myosin cross-bridge cycles. Also, the capacity for physiological adaptations in the motor pathways remains into very old age when an appropriate exercise stimulus is given, and older adults can obtain adaptations in both enhanced neural control of motor units and increased protein synthesis leading to moderate muscle hypertrophy. Since periods of sedentary lifestyle or bed rest due to illness can have severe detraining consequences on the neuromuscular function of an older person, long-term prevention strategies are advocated to avoid excessive physical impairments and activity restrictions in this age group.

AB  - Details design, and operational advantages of a high-pressure concentric riser which can use a dual density mud system. This will reduce mud weight margins and allow setting of fewer casing strings. It also provides improved gas -handling safety. Other advantages include improved underbalanced drilling operations, well testing, and well control. A case study of a well in 6,500ft water depths illustrates the potential advantages.

AB  - Spiral mandrel dies are commonly used for pipe and blown film extrusion. Despite their attractive properties they have not been used for wire-coating applications, because the feeding of the rather large number of spirals led to designs with unacceptably high pressure losses. A design procedure using only a few spiral channels avoids the aforementioned drawbacks and is suitable for wire-coating applications. Backed up by experimental data and a numerical flow analysis, excellent results in terms of concentricity and regularity can be obtained.

AB  - Two new marine gastrotrichs of the genus Thaumastoderma are described from South Korea. T. coronarium sp. nov. was collected from the intertidal zones of Manripo beach and Sopori, Tokchok Island in the Yellow Sea. This species seems to be most closely related to T. bifurcatum CLAUSEN, 1991 or T. truncatum CLAUSEN, 1991 in that they share the following characteristics: one pair of simple, spatulate tentacles; six pairs of dorsal cirri; and absence of eye spots. It differs from these species in having four conspicuous head papillae and a different arrangement of dorsal cirri T. appendiculatum sp. nov. was collected from the intertidal and shallow sublittoral zones of Pongpo beach, Sokcho in the East Sea of Korea, and is easily distinguished from its congeners in having a pair of stout adhesive tubes on the posterior trunk margin, and in that it frequently possesses accessory dorsal cirri. This is the first report on marine gastrotrichs from Korea, and the first record of the genus Thaumastoderma in East Asia.

AB  - In the present study we used the dual probe approach to investigate striatal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation of GABA release from the substantia nigra pars reticulata of the awake, freely moving rat. One microdialysis probe of concentric design was implanted in the dorsolateral striatum and another in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata. Perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 μM) in the dorsolateral striatum decreased local dopamine release (-25%) and increased both glutamate (+40%) and GABA (+35%) release. Moreover, perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 μM) in the dorsolateral striatum increased GABA release (+20%) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Perfusion with the lower (10 μM) N-methyl-D-aspartate concentration in the dorsolateral striatum did not affect striatal dopamine, glutamate and GABA release or nigral GABA release. Intrastriatal perfusion with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (10 μM), at a dose which by itself did not affect basal striatal or nigral neurotransmitter levels, prevented the effects of striatal perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate on both striatal and nigral neurotransmitter release. Intrastriatal dizocilpine maleate was also perfused concurrently with intranigral tetrodotoxin (10 μM) (see accompanying paper). Intrastriatal perfusion with dizocilpine maleate prevented the tetrodotoxin-induced rise in both striatal and nigral GABA levels and profoundly reduced the tetrodotoxin-induced contralateral turning. In addition, intrastriatal dizocilpine maleate delayed the increase in striatal glutamate release evoked by intranigral tetrodotoxin without affecting the associated decrease in striatal dopamine release. The present study demonstrates that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the dorsolateral striatum regulate GABA release in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of the awake rat and provides evidence that this regulation plays a key role in motor function.

AB  - Almost all European countries are member countries of Interpol, the World Customs Organisation and the United Nations. Some of them are Benelux and Schengen countries, and 15 are EU Member States. With this in mind, Europe can be considered, in policing terms, as being made up of a series of concentric and overlapping circles. The 'map' shows overlapping institutional sources, territorial remits, functional specialisations and strategic emphasis. This article focuses on recent developments in European police co-operation, as well as judicial co-operation. International law enforcement co-operation is more and more influenced by basic political developments. Based on a rather complex, and sometimes confusing patchwork of institutions, there is a growing influence of intergovernmental based new developments. In particular prevention and combating organised crime are the main reasons for new and more professional ways of improved horizontal co-operation. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Different management regimes for 1-year rotational set-aside were tested in three experiments that followed winter wheat and started in autumn 1988-90. The regimes included operations that prevented the establishment of volunteers or allowed them to establish and persist until either spring or summer, and also altered the distribution of debris from the winter wheat that preceded the set-aside. For comparison, treatments in the set-aside year also included winter wheat. Samples taken in spring from the first test crop showed that there were few significant or consistent effects on leaf diseases of growing the wheat after different set-aside treatments or after winter wheat. There were significant effects of the set-aside treatments on root and stem base diseases but some of the effects, and the apparent absence of others, are not easily reconciled with current understanding of the biology of the pathogens concerned. In summer, eyespot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) was most severe after winter wheat and least severe after ryegrass. Severity after the other set-aside treatments did not differ significantly. There was more sharp eyespot (Rhizoctonia cerealis) in plots that had been ploughed at the start of the set-aside year, including those sown with winter wheat, than in those that had not. Brown foot rot (Fusarium spp.) was equally severe where the wheat followed wheat or where it followed set-aside treatments that allowed volunteers to develop, and less so where the development of volunteers was prevented. Take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici) was most severe after winter wheat and more severe after set-aside treatments that allowed volunteers to develop and survive through the winter than after those that did not. Effects of ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum) on take-all in the following wheat were particularly variable, perhaps because ryegrass is a host of both the take-all fungus and of Phialophora graminicola, one of its principal antagonists.

AB  - There is concern that caribou (Rangifer tarandus) may avoid roads and facilities (i.e., infrastructure) in the Prudhoe Bay oil field (PBOF) in northern Alaska, and that this avoidance can have negative effects on the animals. We quantified the relationship between caribou distribution and PBOF infrastructure during the post-calving period (mid-June to mid-August) with aerial surveys from 1990 to 1995. We conducted four to eight surveys per year with complete coverage of the PBOF. We identified active oil field infrastructure and used a geographic information system (GIS) to construct ten 1 km wide concentric intervals surrounding the infrastructure. We tested whether caribou distribution is related to distance from infrastructure with a chi-squared habitat utilization-availability analysis and log-linear regression. We considered bulls, calves, and total caribou of all sex/age classes separately. The habitat utilization-availability analysis indicated there was no consistent trend of attraction to or avoidance of infrastructure. Caribou frequently were more abundant than expected in the intervals close to infrastructure, and this trend was more pronounced for bulls and for total caribou of all sex/age classes than for calves. Log-linear regression (with Poisson error structure) of numbers of caribou and distance from infrastructure were also done, with and without combining data into the 1 km distance intervals. The analysis without intervals revealed no relationship between caribou distribution and distance from oil field infrastructure, or between caribou distribution and Julian date, year, or distance from the Beaufort Sea coast. The log-linear regression with caribou combined into distance intervals showed the density of bulls and total caribou of all sex/age classes declined with distance from infrastructure. Our results indicate that during the post-calving period: 1) caribou distribution is largely unrelated to distance from infrastructure; 2) caribou regularly use habitats in the PBOF; 3) caribou often occur close to infrastructure; and 4) caribou do not appear to avoid oil field infrastructure.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to computing depth maps from a large collection of images where the camera motion has been constrained to planar concentric circles. We resample the resulting collection of regular perspective images into a set of multiperspective panoramas, and then compute depth maps directly from these resampled images. Only a small number of multiperspective panoramas is needed to obtain a dense and accurate 3D reconstruction, since our panoramas sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial distance, and vertical elevation. Using multiperspective panoramas avoids the limited overlap between the original input images that causes problems in conventional multi-baseline stereo. Our approach differs from stereo matching of panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints are sine curves. For our multiperspective panoramas, the epipolar geometry, to first order, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo algorithm can be applied to multiperspective panoramas without modification. Experimental results show that our approach generates good depth maps that can be used for image-based rendering tasks such as view interpolation and extrapolation.

AB  - ERS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) frames were collected over the northern Gulf of California during winter 1999. The frames, presented here as a single composite image (100 × 300 km), express a mesoscale meander or eddy-like feature, approximately 80 km wide, located close to the peninsula of Baja California. The eddy is expressed as bright, concentric bands that curve in an anticyclonic direction. The location and dimensions of the eddy are in very good agreement with the winter circulation of the northern Gulf of California described by Lavin et al. (1997), from the analysis of direct observations using satellite-tracked drifters and hydrographic surveys. The SAR image also depicts other smaller, cyclonic eddy-like features, located close to the mainland, which may be associated with the general circulation induced by the anticyclonic eddy. SAR images, together with the reduced number of in situ observations, can provide new and valuable in formation about the mesoscale circulation of the upper ocean in the Gulf of California, even when cloud cover prevents the use of other remote sensors, such as infrared radiometers and visible imaging systems.

AB  - The presence of zircons of crustal origin in the dunites of Kytlym, a subduction-related concentrically zoned dunite-clinopyroxenite-gabbro massif of the Urals Platinum-Bearing Belt, may provide the first direct evidence of the recycling of continental crust into the mantle. Zircons were part of subducted sediments that melted to produce silicic magmas with entrained restitic zircons. These melts induced partial melting in the overlying mantle, which later crystallized as the Kytlym massif. Zircons rapidly captured into early formed dunites were prevented from dissolving completely and underwent different degrees of recrystallization. A few crystals still record their original ages, which range from Ο410 Myr to Ο2800 Myr, thus revealing a different origin. The majority, however, recrystallized in the presence of a limited amount of melt and record the diapir formation, 350-370 Ma, which was coeval with the Uralian high -pressure metamorphism. Lastly, several grains record an age of Ο330 Myr, which is identical, within error, to the Rb-Sr age of the tilaitic gabbros, (337 ± 22 Myr), and may, therefore, represent the crystallization age of the last melts formed during the evolution of Kytlym.

AB  - Digital watermarking is the process of embedding a pattern or an icon into an image to establish legal ownership to protect the copyrights of the image in a publicly accessible image database. In this paper, we propose three robust watermarking schemes. One of our schemes, Diagonal Insersion (DI), modifies the Fourier coefficients of the middle frequencies of the input image, according to a binary string. Another scheme, Randomized Multiple Circles (RMC), is based on a technique proposed by Licks [8] which embeds a binary string by modifying the Fourier coefficients along concentric circles. We introduce a random perturbation into the radius of the circles to protect the waterwark from removal (cryptographic attack). A hybrid technique (HY) is also proposed to combine DI and RMC. These methods are robust against various attacks, such as geometric transformation, filtering, cropping and histogram equalization. Some experimental results are also reported.

AB  - Spiral mandrel dies are commonly used for pipe and blown film extrusion. Despite their attractive properties they have not been used for wire-coating applications, because the feeding of the rather large number of spirals led to designs with unacceptably high pressure losses. A design procedure using only a few spiral channels avoids the aforementioned drawbacks and is suitable for wire-coating applications. Backed up by experimental data and a numerical flow analysis, excellent results in terms of concentricity and regularity can be obtained.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a data base on the isokinetic eccentric muscular performance characteristics of external and internal rotator muscles in the shoulders of professional baseball pitchers. Concentric data are also included and compared with previously published concentric studies. Twenty-five professional baseball pitchers were evaluated with a KinCom isokinetic dynamometer. The subjects tested had a mean age of 23.5 years and a mean body weight of 199 pounds. Eccentric and concentric isokinetic tests were performed at 60 and 120 deg/sec. The testing protocol was standardized for each subject. Test results indicated no statistically significant difference in mean torque between throwing and nonthrowing shoulders for either external or internal rotator muscle groups. Eccentric strength was significantly greater than concentric strength for all muscle groups tested. The external-to-internal rotator muscle strength ratios were well above those previously published for high school through professional pitchers. Mean torque-to-lean body weight ratios were also included to establish a data base. This study establishes one of the first data bases for eccentric isokinetic muscle strength of shoulder rotator muscles in professional baseball pitchers. The data may help clinicians prevent and rehabilitate shoulder injuries in professional throwing athletes.

AB  - The sampler extracts uncompressed cores of 13.3 cm in diameter, up to 70 cm long, from the surface layers of peat. It has two close-fitting concentric cylindrical tubes, the outer one acting as a cutter and the inner one as a collector. As the outer tube is introduced by rotation into the peat, the cut core is collected in the inner tube which is maintained in a fixed position during the rotation phase and then pushed down stepwise. This limits friction between the peat core and the wall of the corer and prevents compression or distortion of the peat. These problems are also reduced by means of three skew cutters allowing the peat to be supported during the slicing action. Air can penetrate between the tubes to the lower end of the core, suppressing any suction effect during withdrawal. The sampler has been tested and has worked satisfactorily in many different peat types.

AB  - Background: Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been reported to induce behavioral abnormalities that model human depression. To investigate the role in depression of phasic dopamine transmission in cortical and limbic areas, we studied the effect of CMS on the responsiveness of dopamine (DA) transmission to aversive and rewarding stimuli in rats by microdialysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX).Methods: Rats were subjected for 30 days to CMS and administered two trials of tail pinch as aversive stimulus and two feeding sessions of a highly palatable food as rewarding stimulus. Concentric microdialysis probes were implanted in the NAc shell and in the medial PFCX.Results: In unstressed rats, DA decreased in the NAc and increased in the PFCX on the first tail-pinch trial; on the 1(st) feeding trial, DA increased in the NAc and to a larger extent in the PFCX. In the second tail-pinch trial or feeding trial, these responses were maintained in the PFCX but underwent habituation in the NAc. CMS did not affect basal dialysate DA in the NAc or in the PFCX but influenced the responsiveness of DA transmission to tail pinches and to feeding in a reciprocal manner. Thus, in the tail-pinch trial, CMS reversed the inhibitory response of NAc DA transmission into a stimulatory one and potentiated the stimulatory response in the PFCX. By contrast, in the feeding trial, CMS blunted the stimulatory response of DA transmission in the NAc in the first trial and in the PFCX in the second trial.Conclusions: CMS reciprocally affected DA responsiveness to motivational stimuli, facilitating or inducing a stimulatory DA response to aversive stimuli but blunting stimulatory responses to rewarding stimuli. Given the postulated role of phasic DA responsiveness in the NAc shell for learning and of DA transmission in the PFCX for expression of motivation, we hypothesize that depression is the result of defective learning and expression of aversive and appetitive motivation.

AB  - Studies of CNS processing of olfactory information have contributed significantly to understanding olfactory-guided behaviour in insects. Evidence in moths suggests that each glomerulus in the antennal lobes has a unique property: receptor-axon projections and dendritic arborizations of uniglomerular output neurons can relate to anatomically and functionally distinct glomeruli. Similar correlations are not typical of the concentrically organized locust antennal lobes. Insights about odour processing in the CNS of female mosquitoes should help us to understand how sensory information can lead to host-seeking behaviour. It will be interesting to learn how inputs from CO2 receptors on the maxillary palps and inputs from antennal olfactory receptors that respond to host odours are integrated centrally, so that pharmacological manipulation of olfactory neuron activity might provide a tool for the control of mosquitoes as important vector insects. The antennal lobe of male and female Aedes aegypti contains 20-25 glomeruli. Primary afferent projections from the antennae and maxillary palps target specific glomeruli of the ipsilateral antennal lobe. Maxillary palp projections are restricted to two posteromedial glomeruli, which do not receive antennal afferents. The latter arborize in the remaining glomeruli.

AB  - Concentrically zoned phosphatic-enriched concretions were collected at three sites from the Monterey Formation. The following minerals were identified: vivianite, lipscombite, rockbridgeite, leucophosphite, mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite, nontronite, todorokite, and barite. The mineralogy of the concretions was slightly different at each of the three collection sites. None of the concretions contains all of the minerals, but the spatial distribution of minerals in individual concretions, overlapping mineralogies between different concretions, and the geochemical properties of the separate minerals suggest a paragenesis represented by the above order. Eh increased from the precipitation of vivianite to that of rockbridgeite/lipscombite. The precipitation of leucophosphite, then mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite and todorokite/Fe-oxide indicates increasing pH. Concretion growth culminated with the precipitation of todorokite, a Mn oxide, and minor amounts of barite along microfractures. Conspicuously absent are Fe-sulfide and Mn-phosphate minerals. The concretions are hosted by finely laminated diatomite. The laminations exhibit little to no deformation around the concretions, requiring that the concretions formed after compaction. We interpret this sediment feature and the paragenesis as recording the evolving pore-water chemistry as the formation was uplifted into the fresh-ground-water zone.

AB  - By using a real-time assay that allows measurement of the phototactic orientation of the                 unicellular alga Chlamydomonas with millisecond time resolution, it can be shown that single photons not                 only induce transient direction changes but that fluence rates as low as 1 photon                   cell-1s-1 can already lead to a persistent orientation. Orientation is a binary                 variable, i.e., in a partially oriented population some organisms are fully oriented while the rest are                 still at random. Action spectra reveal that the response to a pulsed stimulus follows the                 Dartnall-nomogram for a rhodopsin while the response to a persistent stimulus falls off more rapidly                 toward the red end of the spectrum. Thus light of 540 nm, for which chlamy-rhodopsin is equally                 sensitive as for 440-nm light, induces no measurable persistent orientation while 440-nm light does. A                 model is presented which explains not only this behavior, but also how Chlamydomonas can track the light                 direction and switches between a positive and negative phototaxis. According to the model the ability to                 detect the direction of light, to make the right turn and to stay oriented, is a direct consequence of                 the helical path of the organism, the orientation of its eyespot relative to the helix-axis, and the                 special shielding properties of eyespot and cell body. The model places particular emphasis on the fact                 that prolonged swimming into the correct direction not only requires making a correct turn initially,                 but also avoiding further turns once the right direction has been reached.

AB  - Molecular species containing metal-metal bonds have been known for a long time. But these have generally involved transition metals; metal-metal bonds between main-group elements were discovered only more recently. Within the past decade, polyhedral Al4, Al12 and Ga4 species have all been characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the chemistry of low-valent polynuclear Al species in particular has flourished owing to the development of condensation techniques for preparing them by disproportionation of aluminium monohalides. By using this approach, we now report the identification and characterization of an Al77 cluster, which is dramatically larger than any seen hitherto and can be considered an intermediate species to the formation of the bulk metal. X-ray diffraction shows that the cluster has a central Al atom surrounded by three concentric polyhedral shells containing 12, 44 and 20 Al atoms. This Al77 core is stabilized by 20 organic ligands, preventing the formation of the bulk metal. Studies of such clusters should provide insights into the crossover between molecular species and the bulk metal for main-group elements.

AB  - Eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermüller), is becoming an important pest of pome fruits in British Columbia because implementation of noninsecticidal controls for codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., have removed routine sprays that inadvertently controlled it. Knowing the phenology of S. ocellana could improve timing of controls for this pest. Seasonal flight activity of male, eyespotted bud moths was monitored using pheromone-baited traps hung in unsprayed apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia from 1993 to 1996. Emergence of adult males and females and oviposition was monitored from 1994 to1996 to establish relationships between their phenology and accumulated degree-days above 10°C air temperature or number of days after the 1st moth was caught (biofix). Biofix occurred between 1-5 June, except in 1996, when it occurred 2-3 wk later, and flight activity continued until late August. Males and females emerged on the same day, 2.0 ± 1.7 d (mean ± SD, n = 3 yr) before biofix, and oviposition began 4.3 ± 1.5 d after biofix. The nonlinear relationship between cumulative trap catch and dor number of degree-days after biofix was modeled with cumulative Weibull functions. A model based on data from Sunimerland using days after biofix as the predictor variable was more accurate at predicting the interval between biofix and 50% cumulative trap catch for independent data sets from Kelowna and Winfield than a model using degree-days after biofix as the predictor variable. However, the use of degree-days as a predictor variable has wider application to other regions and years. Similar models were used to describe the relationship between days or degree-days after biofix and cumulative emergence of males, emergence of females, and oviposition, respectively. These models will assist in the development of pheromone-based management programs for the eyespotted bud moth, and can be used to formulate control strategies for this pest.

AB  - A virtual ecosystem was developed using genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy systems. The ecosystem simulated and regulated the motion and interactions of computer animated agents in a virtual environment. Within the ecosystem, each agent has its own neural networks that govern its motion strategy so that the creature could learn to perform different behaviors, such as searching for food and evading predators. The inputs of the neural networks were connected with creatures' eye-like sensors and the outputs of the networks were attached to creatures' legs to drive the creatures. The neural networks were evolved using genetic algorithms, including single tournament selection, two-point crossover, and one point mutation. Augmented fuzzy cognitive maps regulated the overall operation of the environment and allowed each creature to switch between different neural networks for finding food and avoiding predators. The experimental results demonstrated that animated agents can evolve and learn how to survive in a complex and dynamic virtual environment. © 2000 IEEE.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the major long-term problem after heart transplantation. However, the assumption, mostly based on experimental animal data, that human CAV is an immune-mediated diffuse concentric intimal proliferation with progressive, homogenous vessel narrowing, involving equally epicardial arteries and the microcirculation, leading inevitably to ischemic organ failure and death, does not adequately reflect the complexity of the clinical setting. CAV in humans is much more characterized by a very heterogeneous pattern concerning pathogenetic mechanisms (e.g., immune activation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, CMV infection, hyperlipoproteinemia), protective mechanisms (e.g., remodeling, endothelium-derived vasodilators), endothelial dysfunction, morphological manifestations, involvement of the microcirculation, temporal appearance, disease progression and prognosis. Thus, clinicians have to deal with several clinical dilemmas of the disease, which can be summarized in three simple questions: how can CAV be detected/diagnosed, how can CAV and related events be predicted, and finally how can CAV be prevented and treated. Initial and promising answers to these pivotal questions have been found in recent years, and continuing progress is under way.

AB  - In a radioactive waste repository, hydrogen may be produced by anoxic corrosion of the metallic components, and by water radiolysis. The design of deep geological repositories presently envisaged in many countries tends to inhibit the migration of every chemical species coming from the repository, by means of several concentric watertight barriers. This tightness, which is desirable for other reasons, might prevent hydrogen evacuation and cause a pressure rise in the near-field. Can this pressure break the barriers? In the first stage of the process, the hydrogen dissolves in the porewater. It is shown in the present paper that in the vicinity of a steel surface embedded in clay, the pressure rise due to the production of dissolved hydrogen may be large already (a few MPa), and may represent a significant fraction of the barrier resistance limit. In the second phase of the process, a gas bubble may form, causing a further pressure increase. The problem of gas production in geological repositories is treated here as a special case of thermo-hydro-chemico-mechanical coupling in a porous medium. The time needed for the bubble to form depends on the nature of the metal, and on the characteristics of the barrier. The purpose of this paper is to give orders of magnitude for the time and space scales associated with hydrogen production in the near-field of a deep repository, before the formation of a gaseous phase. The conditions under which a gas phase forms are also discussed.

AB  - To avoid problems of freezing in solar collectors and blockage of the tubes by calcium deposits in hard water areas, various indirect techniques have been devised to connect the collector and the hot water storage tank. One of the most common heat exchanger-based thermosyphon systems utilises a concentric heat exchanger around the hot water storage tank. Due to the simultaneous occurrence of both cooling and heating processes, the performance of concentric heat exchanger in conjunction with solar storage tanks is quite complex and different from that of traditional heat exchangers. The flow features and heat transfer characteristics in the annulus are numerically investigated and the calculations are validated against experimental data. A new heat exchanger deficiency coefficient is used to quantify the degradation of temperature stratification in the inner storage tank caused by the flow in the annulus. © 1997, Begell House Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the development of myocardial necrosis, fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis in cardiac allograft in order to provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of anti-rejection. METHODS: The recipient was pretreated with inoculation of donor splenocytes (SPC) followed by cyclophosphamide (CP). Heterotopic cervical heart transplantation was performed. The allografts stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson and Van Gieson were studied about inflammatory cell infiltration, myocardial necrosis, fibrosis and arteriosclerosis. RESULTS: Preconditioning with SPC followed by CP prolonged the survival time of cardiac allograft. Inflammatory cell infiltration, myocardial necrosis, fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis in cardiac allograft were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The development of acute cardiac allograft rejection originated from the epicardial area to the intimal area of the heart in rat. The infiltration of collagenous fiber in the coronary arteries is one of the major causes of concentric stenosis. The pretreatment of SPC followed by CP can prevent and relieve the rejection.

AB  - A positioning stand can help a surgeon with positioning and locking endoscopic tools, thereby avoiding the need for an assistant surgeon. The kinematic configuration of the positioning stand is comprised of two main parts: the arm (for positioning), and the wrist (for orienting the tool). The main requirement of the wrist is to perform spherical movements around the incision point. A concentric multilink spherical joint design has been developed for the wrist mechanism. The size synthesis is performed to minimize the overall size of the wrist, and also to maximize its range of angular movements. The type synthesis of the positioning arm has led to the use of a SCARA configuration as a balanced and easily moved arm configuration. The size synthesis of the arm is carried out with the goal of minimizing its overall dimensions, based on the arm's reachable workspace and manipulability. The integration of the wrist and arm is performed by optimizing the orientation of the wrist in such a way that the interference between the wrist and the workspace of the surgeon is minimized.

AB  - The cost of astrographs with pupil diameters greater than 1 or 2 meters can be somewhat reduced if the primary mirror is made spherical and the aberration corrected at or near the prime focus, thus avoiding the classical Schmidt or Maksutov full pupil diameter refractive components. Such a corrector solution is presented here for large spherical primaries with speeds up to f/4. This is based on the `KiwiStar' principle presented here in 1997, in which a large spherical-concentric catoptric is combined by pupil transfer with a smaller spherical-concentric catadioptric to give well-corrected wide-field images of high speed and broad passband. The designs studied at the time were limited to those with entrance pupils <2 m diameter, but it has been found possible to extend the aberration correction capability to pupils of larger diameter. The only significant constraint found in the present study is that the spherical aberration of primaries faster than f/4 is difficult to control. The design presented here is a 4 m entrance-pupil-diameter, f/1.4 optic of 0.2 arcsec rms resolution over the whole of a 0.5° field (50 mm diameter), for a bandpass of 486-850 nm. To fully sample this field would require 108 pixels of 5 μm dimension. An extended design with an 8 m diameter primary is also shown, that may be scalable to approximately 30 m. To achieve this performance, the strictly concentric format of the original `KiwiStar' design has been relaxed, thus providing extra degrees of freedom to compensate the large pupil aberrations introduced by the spherical aberration of the primary. Nevertheless, the new design still has only one relatively small and weak aspheric surface to provide zonal correction, all other surfaces being spherical.

AB  - This paper suggests an efficient approach to collision avoidance of a practical two-robot system. The approach is based on the C-space of one robot, and we consider only two and three-dimensional C-space in which nearly all industrial manipulators can be reasonably represented for collision avoidance problems. The C-space of one robot is discretized with the concentric circles or spheres centered at the goal configuration. We then introduce the concept of free arc which is a set of the candidate configuration points on the concentric circle or sphere at each sampling time to avoid collisions. It is represented simply with respect to the coordinate frame attached to the goal configuration. The free arc is used as a tool for collision avoidance of a two-robot system and sub-optimality can be considered in determining a collision-free path. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a method to construct C-obstacles in a time-varying environment more efficiently than the existing methods (e.g. slice projection method) by restricting the search space at the expense of sacrificing completeness. Thus, it enables us to implement a practical collision avoidance algorithm for a two-robot system with decreased computational cost. Simulation results for two 2-d.o.f. manipulators and two PUMA robots are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB  - A concentric microstrip triangular-ring antenna structure using the log-periodic principle for increasing the impedance bandwidth of the microstrip patch antenna is described. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is applied to analyze the proposed structure. A special technique to model the slanted metallic boundaries of the triangular ring has been used in the general FDTD algorithm to avoid the staircase approximation. The method improves the accuracy of the original FDTD algorithm without increasing the complexity. The radiation patterns at different frequencies over wide-band width are obtained experimentally. ©1998 IEEE.

AB  - Anatomical and biomechanical features and the subject's training background make hamstring strains common in sport, especially in disciplines requiring speed and strength. Rehabilitation must be consonant with the chronological sequence of the acute and healing stages of biological muscle strain repair and recovery of function. Hydrokinesitherapy, stretching, concentric and eccentric exercises, physical therapy, isokinetic dynamometry and proprioceptive training are useful components of a rehabilitation programme. Prevention of recurrences, not speed of recovery, is the goal. Recurrence within two months from the resumption of sport, in fact, is often an indication of inappropriate rehabilitation.

AB  - The terms sociallearning and social influence have been used descriptively and theoretically to characterize a broad range of animal behavior from physical antipredatory adaptations such as eye spots, which are totally under genetic control, to the human capacity for the exaggeration of individual characteristics, known as caricature, which are largely under cognitive control. In the present review, the various forms of social influence and social learning are identified and distinghished from imitation, a term that generally has been reserved for behavioral matching that cannot be accounted for using simpler specifically predisposed, motivational, or learning mechanisms. It is suggested that much of the ambiguity in the literature concerning the various forms of social learning can be attributed to the distinction between the function of a behavior and the mechanisms responsible for its occurrence. Finally, the various mechanisms that have been proposed to account for imitative learning are presented and an attempt is made to evaluate them. © 2001 Taylor and Francis, LLC.

AB  - The Iobula giant motion detector (LGMD) is a wide-field bilateral visual interneuron in North American locusts that acts as an angular threshold detector during the approach of a solid square along a trajectory perpendicular to the long axis of the animal (Gabbiani et al., 1999a). We investigated the dependence of this angular threshold computation on several stimulus parameters that alter the spatial and temporal activation patterns of inputs onto the dendritic tree of the LGMD, across three locust species. The same angular threshold computation was implemented by LGMD in all three species. The angular threshold computation was invariant to changes in target shape (from solid squares to solid discs) and to changes in target texture (checkerboard and concentric patterns). Finally, the angular threshold computation did not depend on object approach angle, over at least 135° in the horizontal plane. A two-dimensional model of the responses of the LGMD based on linear summation of motion-related excitatory and size-dependent inhibitory inputs successfully reproduced the experimental results for squares and discs approaching perpendicular to the long axis of the animal. Linear summation, however, was unable to account for invariance to object texture or approach angle. These results indicate that LGMD is a reliable neuron with which to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying the generation of complex but invariant visual responses by dendritic integration. They also suggest that invariance arises in part from non-linear integration of excitatory inputs within the dendritic tree of the LGMD.

AB  - Archytas marmoratus (Townsend) was reared on four strains of corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). One strain did not diapause or entered a weak diapause. A portion of the other three strains entered diapause when reared at 19 or 22°(Degree Sign)C and 10:14 h photoperiod (L:D). No A. marmoratus entered diapause; 90% eclosed with no differences among strains or rearing condition, and the number of days from host pupation to eclosion within rearing condition was similar regardless of host strain. Parasitized pupae did not enter a chill-terminated diapause, as indicated by loss of larval eyespots within 2 wks. Either the presence of A. marmoratus maggots prevented diapause in its host or diapause was terminated by rapid development of the maggot after host pupation. These data suggest that A. marmoratus does not overwinter as a larva or pupa in the cooler regions of its distribution.

AB  - Iodine was accurately determined in food-related certified reference materials (CRMs) by wet ashing in closed steel bombs using a mixture of nitric acid and perchloric acid followed by measurement of iodine by ICP-MS at m/z 127. The iodine concentrations determined were 0.15-4.59 μg g-1 (dry mass). Potentially volatile iodine species such as hydrogen iodide were converted during the ashing procedure to non-volatile species. Hereby memory problems in the ICP-MS due to volatile iodine were prevented. The concentric nebulizer which was used in combination with a low dead-volume cyclonic spray chamber improved the iodine signal intensity and reduced the wash-out time between samples compared with the standard Ryton double-pass spray chamber equipped with a cross flow nebulizer. Iodine contamination from the PTFE liners of the bombs led to blank values at an average of 9 ng per ashing. The limit of detection which was based on three standard deviations of the blank was 30 ng g-1 (dry mass). By adding 3% v/v methanol to the analyte solutions and increasing the plasma power to 1200 W, the signal-to-noise ratio and hence the limit of detection was improved by 50% due to the signal enhancement effect by carbon of the incompletely ionized iodine.

AB  - Newly collected Ordovician sponges from the San Juan Formation allowed recognition of a new species and four genera described for the first time in South America. The new species Incrassospongia ramis was collected in the upper levels of the San Juan Formation (Early Llanvirnian) at cerro La Chilca section. The new species is characterized by upward-radiating skeletal fibres bridged by irregularly distributed monoclonid dendroclones. The fibres are irregular and commonly bifurcated. The absence of horizontal concentric elements clearly differentiates the new species from the type species. Allosacus sp. was collected from the middle part of the Formation (Early Arenigian) at Gualcamayo section and also from the upper levels at the cerro Viejo section (Early Llanvirnian). This discoidal genus was differenciated from related anthaspidellid genera due to the presence of spongocoel and arrangement of radial canals. The trabs are composed by a single row of smooth monoclonid dendroclones. Eospongia sp. was recovered from the middle part of the Formation (Early Arenigian) at Niquivil section. This obconical genus is characterized by large vertical canals, a very small spongocoel and long dendroclone spicules with enlarged ends. Lissocoelia sp. was collected in the upper levels of the San Juan Formation (Early Llanvirnian) at Villicum range. The Argentinian material shows small and irregularly distributed dendroclones in the sponge surface and a moderately irregular distribution in the sponge walls. Two or five intraparietal spicules separate conspicuous and irregularly distributed radial canals.

AB  - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors. Without treatment a concentric form with left ventricular dysfunction develops characteristically into an excentric form with progressive heart failure. Many pathogenetically important factors are known. Treatment is possible with life-style modification and nearly all first-line antihypertensive drugs. It should aim at prevention or permanent normalisation of an existing LVH.

AB  - Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) have been commercially available for almost 10 years, and although they have many attractive properties their use is limited almost entirely to injection molded parts. The reasons LCPs are not extruded into films stem from the strong influence of shear to orient the polymer in the direction of flow, combined with very long relaxation time which prevents the induced orientation from randomizing after melt extrusion. This paper will explain how transverse shear can be used effectively to orient LCP films in multiple directions, making the film useful for applications including printed circuit board substrates and high barrier packaging. A machine for producing flat multiaxially oriented LCP film has been developed, using concentric rotating surfaces to orient the LCP during a single extrusion step.

AB  - We have studied the effect of exhaustive concentric physical exercise on glutathione redox status and the possible relationship between blood glutathione oxidation and blood lactate and pyruvate levels. Levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in blood increase after exhaustive concentric physical exercise in trained humans. GSSG levels were 72% higher immediately after exercise than at rest. They returned to normal values 1 h after exercise. Blood reduced glutathione (GSH) levels did not change significantly after the exercise. We have found a linear relationship between GSSG-to-GSH and lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in human blood before, during, and after exhaustive exercise. In rats, physical exercise also caused an increase in blood GSSG levels that were 200% higher after physical exercise than at rest. GSH levels did not change significantly. Thus, both in rats and humans, exhaustive physical exercise causes a change in glutathione redox status in blood. We have also found that antioxidant administration, i.e., oral vitamin C, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, or glutathione, is effective in preventing oxidation of the blood glutathione pool after physical exercise in rats.

AB  - Farmers are provided with simple methods to carry out disease risk assessments in individual fields which enable them to make decisions on the need for fungicide treatment. Assessment of mildew (Erysisphe graminis) and rust (Puccinia Striiformis) incidence is on whole plants until growth stage 32 (GS 32). At later stages, assessments are truly marie on the three upper leaves. Risk of eyespot (Tapesia yallundae) is estimated in spring wither using agronomic data, disease incidence or a combination of both. Risk evaluation of the septoria diseases Leptosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola is based on days with precipitation of more than 1 mm per day anti the susceptibility of varieties. In Denmark, the decision support system PC-Plant Protection is used to combine information on thresholds with recommendations for treatments using adjusted fungicide dosages. Weekly reports on disease attack in winter wheat are made on a national level by the Danish Agricultural Advisory Centre. At 55 localities, 2 5 varieties are assessed. This information indicates the general disease situation in the whole country, in different regions and varieties. On a national level, maps are also generated giving accumulated values for precipitation and temperatures. A field monitoring system run in the period 1985 1993 provided actual information on the level of pests and diseases in Denmark, as well as data on yearly variations in the need for fungicide treatments, based on data collected from farmers' field assessments.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of predicting isokinetic knee extension and flexion peak torques from anthropometric dimensions. Male college athletes (N = 105) were evaluated for concentric isokinetic knee extension and flexion torques at 60, 120, 300, and 450 deg/sec using a Biodex dynamometer. Anthropometric dimensions included height, body mass, lean body mass (LBM), percent fat, age, and other various measured and derived leg indices. Multiple regression analysis on a validity sample (n = 80) selected midthigh cross-sectional area (CSA), height, and LBM to predict knee extension torques at 60, 120, 300, and 450 deg/sec (R =.70–.80); at 300 deg/sec, body mass replaced LBM in the prediction equation (R =.79). Muscle (SA was the only variable common to all prediction equations to estimate knee flexion torque at all speeds, although the multiple correlations remained comparable (R =.55–.80). The prediction equations were cross-validated on a sample of 25 randomly selected subjects from the original group and produced correlation coefficients of r =.51–.76 for estimating concentric isokinetic knee torques. It was concluded that anthropometric dimensions can be used to estimate isokinetic leg strength levels in male collegiate athletes and provide additional information for the preparticipation physical screening. These findings may be useful in the prevention of athletic injuries to the lower extremities. © 1991 Butterworth–Heinemann.

AB  - Symptoms of red leather leaf of oats were widespread and severe in spring 1988 on autumn‐sown oat crops in the south and east of Ireland. The disease was characterized by grey‐brown elliptical lesions, developing into light‐grey eyespots surrounded by dark borders. Plants were stunted and showed reddish‐brown foliar pigmentation extending beyond the lesions. Spermospora avenae was isolated and shown to be pathogenic to oats. Cultural characteristics of the pathogen on several agar media are described. The disease has previously been reported only from the USA, Turkey and Australia. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The effects of panicle compactness and host plant resistance on the rate of population increase of sorghum midge (Contarinia sorghicola Coq.), head bugs (Calocoris angustatus Leth.) and head caterpillar (Helicoverpa armigera Hb.) in large concentric plots over three sequential sowings during the 1985–86 rainy seasons were studied. Early‐planted crops suffered less damage than the late‐planted crops. H. armigera damage was negligible in genotypes with loose panicles. Calocoris angustatus population increase was lower in genotypes with loose panicles. Panicle compactness did not affect the damage caused by C. sorghicola and Campylomma spp. Host plant resistance had a marked effect on the rate of population increase across sowing dates in the case of sorghum midge and head bugs. Thus, cultivars with resistance to insects and/or with loose panicles can help to reduce the losses caused by panicle‐feeding insects in sorghum. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The shear viscosities of 19 galliosilicate and related liquids have been measured using the concentric cylinder method. Nine of the liquid compositions lie in the Na2O-Ga2O3-SiO2 system, eight liquids correspond in composition to Xn+                             1/nGaSi3O8 (where X = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Ln, Ba, Sr, amd Ca), and five liquids are Li silicates related by the exchange of Al, Ga, and Fe. The measurements were performed at 1 atm of air pressure in the temperature range of 1700-900°C and a viscosity range of 101.3-105 dPaS. The rotation rates ranged from 0.5 to 100 rpm. All melts exhibited Newtonian viscosities. A correlation can be made between liquid viscosity and glassy heat of solution that is similar to that previously noted for the alkali exchange in aluminosilicate melts of the formula XAlSi3O8 (where X = alkali). Results confirm galliosilicate liquids as useful analogues for aluminosilicate liquids in studies where the high viscosities of the latter may prevent experimental determination of certain relaxed liquid properties. -from Author

AB  - The radial-axial splitter, developed and patented by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, represents a major step forward in nonexplosive excavation that put the U.S. at the cutting edge of mining technology. Radial-axial technology is successful because it applies tensile loads to rock from within the rock's mass. Drilling provides access to the rock and is followed by splitting, which attacks the rock's natural tensile weakness to cause fragmentation. Rock breaking is accomplished through the hydraulic actuation of three concentric components-the feather, the wedge and the trust rod-that transfer the splitting loads to the rock.

AB  - A nonintrusive high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system was installed and flight tested on the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility. This system consists of a matrix of 25 pressure orifices arranged in concentric circles on the nose of the vehicle to determine angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and pressure altitude. During the course of the flight tests, it was determined that satisfactory results could be achieved using a subset of just nine ports. The high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system was calibrated and demonstrated using reference airdata generated by way of minimum variance estimation techniques which blended airdata measurements from two wingtip airdata booms with inertial velocities, aircraft angular rates and attitudes, precision radar tracking, and meteorological analyses. Calibration results are presented. Although analyses were not performed on-board in real-time, the High Alpha Research Vehicle high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system and resulting airdata algorithms were validated as being real-time capable using flight data in ground based simulations. Algorithm implementation, failure detection modes using a x2 "goodness-of-fit" test, and fault tolerance techniques using weighted least squares are described. Flight-test results are presented. Under moderate maneuvering conditions the high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system was shown to give excellent results. Empirical verification was performed over a large portion of the High Alpha Research Vehicle flight envelope with a Mach number range from 0.15 to 1.20 and an angle-of-attack range from -8.0 to 55.0°. Angle-of-sideslip excursions covered the range from -15.0 to 15.0°. © Copyright 1991 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.

AB  - Most staghorn calculi are infection stones composed of struvite and/or carbonate apatite. Sometimes, cystine, uric acid, whewellite and brushite stones also assume a staghorn configuration when located in the kidney. It is very important in stone crushing to know the composition and architecture of the stones. Struvite stones show a concentric laminal structure and are fragile because of wide interstices of crystals and rich organic matrix. These stones usually contain many bacterial colonies in the interstices of crystals and bacteria break out of the stones when they are crushed. Therefore, perioperative administration of antibiotics is necessary for prevention of bacteremia and sepsis. Whewellite stones and uric acid stones have a smooth surface and reveal compact radial and laminal structure especially in the peripheral layer. They are very hard and are refractory to crushing, and the fragments are large. Cystine stones show a compact radial monomineral texture and are very hard. The fragments made by crushing are large. Therefore, combination therapy of stone crushing and irrigation of alkali solution may be useful for treatment of cystine stones as well as uric acid stones. Calcium phosphate stones, hydroxyapatite or brushite stones, are rare and are formed in hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome and renal tubular acidosis. Hydroxyapatite stones are rich in matrix and fragile. Brushite stones reveal radiate structure and are hard. There is no general method of treatment for staghorn calculi but we should select the most reasonable method including open surgery for each case taking into consideration the stone composition, predisposing factors and possibility of stone residue and recurrence.

AB  - The accuracy of metering by screw dosage equipment with or without gravimetric control depends primarily on the flow of material to the discharging screw. In the case of cohesive solids, stirring devices are generally required to prevent bridging. Experimental observations show that flow conditions correlate directly with the intensity of stirring. Mass flow in the metering container and hence optimum constancy of metering are attainable only from certain stirring efficiencies upwards. Cases of interference to metering due to poor flow of solids can be explained and overcome by modified dimensioning. The effects of the principal parameters - geometry and speed of rotation of the stirrer - are studied with the aid of two stirrer configurations - viz, overhead and concentric. Straightforward model calculations provide a mathematical method of estimation for optimum and reliable stirrer dimensioning also applicable to strongly cohesive solids.

AB  - Hyperopic or aphakic spectacle lenses give rise to a concentric constriction, myopic lenses to an enlargement of the visual field due to their prismatic effect. The constriction may induce a ring scotoma of up to 20° width. The prismatic effects are considerably smaller when contact lenses are used for the correction of high ametropia, and both overlapping fields and ring scotomas may thus be avoided. The visual field especially in high hyperopia or aphakia will benefit from contact lenses.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate with the new dynamo ergometer the forces produced within a defined range of motion at a constant velocity during concentric translatoric work as well as to investigate fatigue based on neuromuscular and metabolic parameters. We examined 11 male sports students with the 'Motomir' device with the subjects in a sitting position. The test consisted of four times 1 min of concentric leg work with 1-min rest phases in between. The subjects were asked to do maximum effort push movements with one leg and maximum effort pull movements with the other leg. The translatoric form of movement did not reveal any significant differences in strength between the left and right legs. The strength of the extensors was significantly higher than that of the flexors during all exercise stages (p<0.001). A significant decrease in strength was established for extensor muscles and no significant decrease for the flexor muscles. The quotient of flexor/extensor was 0.43±0.07 in the first exercise stage and increased in every stage till the fourth. There was a correlation (p<0.001) between the difference in lactate of the first and fourth exercise stages and the percentage of force decrease from the 1st to the 4th min. The electric activity of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius muscles decreased from the first to the fourth exercise stage. This decrease was however not significant. The translatoric constant velocity dynamo ergometer allows both diagnosis and training at varying angles and varying speeds while avoiding unphysiological maximum loads. In contrast to conventional isokinetic dynamometers a translatoric work promotes the rolling movement in the knee and provides new aspects for rehabilitation.

AB  - We could examine twice the laparoscopic and histological alterations in a female case of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated with myasthenia gravis at an interval of seventeen years. She was fifty-five in age, and underwent the first laparoscopy and liver biopsy for her unexplained liver dysfunction. In results, she had a whitish liver and liver histology showed periductal fibrosis in an edematous concentric form. Following seventeen years, she did not come to our clinic since she was nearly asymptomatic other than intermittent appearance of slight itching. In 1994, she revisited our outpatient clinic for her liver dysfunction. ERCP revealed a beaded appearance in the intrahepatic bile ducts. She was re-admitted to our hospital for close examination. The second laparoscopy exhibited a coarse nodular elevation with ditch-like depression on the liver surface. Liver histology showed conspicuous periductal fibrosis surrounding a markedly and irregularly dilated interlobular bile duct with septal fibrosis. Mild cellular infiltration in the portal tracts were also seen. No reports are currently available concerning the complication of myasthenia gravis in PSC, and the repeated morphological evaluation at the long interval like this case. © 1995, The Japan Society of Hepatology.

AB  - A scanning stage (0.25 μm step) on a microscope photometer was used interactively to delineate areas for measurement in transverse sections of skeletal muscle reacted histochemically for glycogen. The fibers chosen for measurement had conspicuous cores of glycogen between their myofibrils. Areas for measurement (either whole fibers or their cores) were delineated by moving the section with respect to the optical axis of the microscope, which was marked with eyepiece cross-hairs. After tracing the perimeter, the circumscribed area was scanned in a raster pattern and absorbance data were shown by three-dimensional plotting, gray maps, and contour maps. Relative amounts of glycogen were obtained from the product of absorbance x area. Data matrices were unpacked into concentric zones (by emptying top and bottom rows plus first and last columns of intermediate rows) to find the radial distribution of glycogen in cores. Cores were found with and without radial gradients, and radial gradients were either positive or negative.

AB  - Bacteria isolated from wheat seedlings, plants or straw from several field sites were screened for antagonism towards the cereal eyespot pathogen Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides on several media of differing nutrient status. Thirteen out of 348 isolates inhibited pathogen growth on low‐nutrient media and several also prevented spore germination or reduced germ tube extension. These were selected for further tests on wheat seedlings inoculated with the eyespot fungus. Twelve known bacterial antagonists of other fungal plant pathogens were tested in vitro using the same methods, and the majority showed some activity towards P. herpotrichoides. Selected isolates were equally inhibitory to both W and R pathotypes of the fungus. Effects of potential antagonists on disease development were assessed by scoring lesions or by counting the number of infection plaques formed by the fungus on leaf sheaths. Two isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens, along with a commercial strain of Streptomyces griseoviridis, showed activity both in vitro and in subsequent infection trials with plants and may therefore be of potential value as antagonists of P. herpotrichoides.

AB  - Stresses and deformations resulting from centrifugal forces in rotating specially orthotropic circular plates are determined. The classical laminated plate theory is employed in the analysis, and the results are presented in a manner which illustrates the effect of anisotropy. The plate is assumed to be rigidly fixed to a concentric rod allowing no deformation in its central region. The outer boundary is either free of any constraints or the plate is placed in a stiff casing which prevents radial deformation. A stiffness ratio, which is defined as the ratio of circumferential stiffness to radial stiffness, is used as the parameter to indicate the degree of anisotropy. Having a stiffness ratio greater than one eliminated the stress build-up on the boundaries. Higher stiffness ratios reduced the compressive stresses which began to occur near the outer boundary when the boundary was restrained from radial expansion, thus contributing to stability against local buckling. The results of Tsai-Wu failure analysis also showed that the choice of a stiffness ratio higher than one gives higher resistance against ply failure in tension. © 1995.

AB  - Random amplified polymorphic DNA assays were carried out on a range of isolates of Rhizoctonia cerealis to identify markers common to all isolates. Two fragments were isolated, cloned and used to probe Southern blots of DNA from R. cerealis and isolates from a range of anastomosis groups of Rhizoctonia solani. The two fragments hybridized specifically to DNA of R. cerealis and not to DNA of any of the isolates of R. solani. Both fragments were partially sequenced and two pairs of primers were generated for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplification of a fragment of the anticipated size occurred following PCR of all isolates of R. cerealis and not from any of a range of fungal species associated with disease of the stem base of cereals. The primer pairs for R. cerealis were also used, along with those for Microdochium nivale and W and R-type of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, to detect these pathogens in extracts from field-grown wheat plants exhibiting symptoms of sharp eyespot, eyepost, foot rot or a combination of the diseases. No relationship was found between visual disease assessment of sharp eyespot at growth stage 37 and the results of PCR. However, the results of PCR and visual disease assessment at growth stage 75 were similar, indicating that visual disease assessment may no be reliable until later growth stages. This sytem offers the potential to detect the presence of R. cerealis in cereals and avoid problems commonly associated with conventional diagnosis of this disease and isolation of the pathogen.

AB  - Routine collections of leafroller larvae in Washington apple orchards for the purposes of assessing the kinds of parasites and levels of parasitism revealed the presence of an unknown species. Specimens sent to the USDA-ARS Systematic Entomology Laboratory, Beltsville, were identified as Colpodypeus florus (Walker). This report represents an extension of its geographic range, the first record in the U.S., as well as a new host record. Colpodypeus florus is a gregarious ectoparasitic eulophid which is widely distributed in Europe where it is the most common natural enemy of tortricids in orchards and other crops. It was introduced into Canada and released in small numbers in 1966 and 1967. No recovery was reported until 1992 when it was reared from larvae of obliquebanded leafroller and eyespotted bud moth in Ontario. In that same year the level of parasitism by C. florus in two unsprayed apple orchards in Washington was 66% and 75%. The parasite's behavior and key characters that indicate its possible presence in an orchard are discussed. Notes on the distribution in Washington and methods of rearing C. florus on pandemis leafroller larvae are described, along with its potential as a biological control agent in Washington.

AB  - Intracardiac flow patterns during heart development were studied by injection of india ink into the yolk sac circulation of chick embryos at Hamburger-Hamilton stages 10 to 17. We injected india ink into a small venule or capillary, carefully preventing application of overpressure to the vascular system, and recorded the intracardiac route by video. From stage 12 onward, blood flow was laminar, and separate intracardiac currents were visualized. The yolk sac was divided into a left and a right half. Blood coursed through each half in concentric loops, ranging from the marginal sinus to the sinus venosus. This parallel array persisted within the heart. Bilateral to the embryo, two lateral regions arose that extended wedgelike within each half, resulting in six equally sized yolk sac regions at stage 16. The process of heart looping was not accompanied by a change in flow pattern. However, developmental changes of the yolk sac circulation were reflected in alteration of the intracardiac flow pattern. From stage 16 onward, the intracardiac flow pattern was no longer determined by the left- or right-hand side of the yolk sac but by bilateral anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the yolk sac. Blood from the lateral regions of the yolk sac was preferentially distributed to the head. The results show that in preseptation stages a relatively stable flow pattern is present. We suggest that alterations in blood flow could influence the process of normal heart development.

AB  - We have recently modeled the structural factors responsible for the increased slope of the dose-vascular resistance response curves in the hindquarter bed under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Slope increases when the ratio of wall thickness to internal radius ri) increases and when ri decreases, but the slope decreases with greater wall stiffness. Enhanced slope is an indicator of the vascular amplifier properties. Resistance at maximum vasodilation in hypertension is also structurally determined and is most affected by a reduction in riEarly treatment studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) suggest that the reduction in ri can be reversed, suggesting that it is due to vascular hypertrophy. The concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle is an amplifier of stroke volume. Together, the vascular and left ventricular amplifiers contribute about 70% to the elevated total peripheral resistance in renovascular hypertension. In SHR, the vascular amplifier is present early in postnatal life before the onset of hypertension, which occurs in parallel with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The development of the vascular amplifiers appears to be under the control of the renin-angiotensin system, whilst LVH appears to be under sympathoadrenal control, acting through cardiac α -adrenoceptors. Early immunosympathectomy plus prazosin treatment specifically prevents development of LVH in SHR and also prevents hypertension. In human hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy also plays an important role; after a period of prolonged therapy, the rate of redevelopment of hypertension when the drugs are stopped depends on the degree of regression of LVH during treatment. We conclude that the early development of vascular and cardiac amplifiers in primary hypertension appears to be genetically determined and the role of the heart in pathogenesis appears to be greater than previously thought. © Current Science Ltd.

AB  - As a consequence of performing plyometric type exercises, such as depth jumps, impact forces placed on the musculoskeletal system during landing can lead to a potential for injury. A reduction of impact forces upon landing could therefore contribute to reduce the risk of injury. Twenty subjects performed a series of loaded jumps for maximal height, with and without a brake mechanism designed to reduce impact force during landing. The braked jumps were performed on the Plyometric Power System (PPS) with its braking mechanism set at 75% of body weight during the downward phase. The non-braked condition involved jumps with no braking. Vertical ground reaction force data, sampled for 5.5 s at 550 Hz from a Kistler forceplate, were collected for each jump condition. The following parameters were then calculated: peak vertical force, time to peak force, passive impact impulse and maximum concentric force. The brake served to significantly (p<0.01) reduce peak impact force by 155% and passive impact impulse by 200%. No significant differences were found for peak concentric force production. The braking mechanism of the PPS significantly reduced ground impact forces without impeding concentric force production. The reduction in eccentric loading, using the braking mechanism, may reduce the incidence of injury associated with landings from high intensity plyometric exercises.

AB  - A new multistage Hough transform approach to the problem of ellipse detection in images is presented. The proposed approach is based on the polar and pole definition of conics and its advantage lies in avoiding the propagation of parameter estimation error over the successive stages of the Hough transform. The proposed method is capable of detecting partially visible ellipses, overlapping ellipses, and groups of concentric ellipses. A set of experimental results is presented to demonstrate these capabilities of the suggested approach. © 1993.

AB  - The three point method (TPM) has been successfully applied to several seismic series and has provided information about the spatial characteristics (azimuth and dip) of the fault planes activated in the rupture process. A new development of the TPM to determine temporal characteristics, is presented, to obtain the evolution of the fracturing process of an active fault system. For the analysis of the 158 microearthquakes and earthquakes that took place in the seismic series of Antequera in June 1989, the choice of a threshold magnitude (mu = 2.5) has permitted the events related to the most relevant fractures to be distinguished. Secondly, only the events between two concentric spheres (here named Spatial Crown) with respect to a given earthquake, have been used in order to avoid taking into account earthquakes that are too close to each other, together with the very distant events that have little relation to the event analysed. The Spatial Crown has permitted some clear results in the Antequera series, where we have found that the fracturing process began fundamentally with N 80° E planes and evolved to N 65° W planes. Finally, an error analysis enables an estimation of the uncertainty in the results to be obtained from the errors in the data. © 1993.

AB  - Classical moir6 methods have the capability of generating equal depth contours of an object. These images are often difficult to examine, quickly comprehend, and use in an industrial inspection system. An improvement in the enhancement of useful information can be made by generating an error map or a map of differences between perfect and imperfect objects. This can be done by viewing gratings projected onto the test object through a custom grating made by capturing the image of a grating projected on a perfect object and translating the image into a physical grating through photolithography techniques, but generation of such custom physical gratings can be difficult and expensive. A computer generated arbitrary grating projector has been reported in the literature, but except for real time shadow moir6 applications, the captured distorted gratings required further computer processing. We have demonstrated video methods to generate such error maps in real time. A further enhancement of moir6 for automated or machine aided inspection can be made by removing any restrictions on the shape of the output moir6 contours. As an example, if the object under test matches the perfect object, the output moir6 pattern could be a series of concentric circles in the form of a Fresnel zone plate or any other arbitrary pattern that would allow optical processing. We have developed a method of creating arbitrary moiré patterns from any arbitrary diffusely reflecting object that does not require any physical grating fabrication. The moir6 patterns can be made in any form, from equal depth contours, to error maps, to any pattern that would aid in automated or machine aided inspection or sorting. We first generate the desired output moir6 pattern, either in the computer or by capturing the image of the desired pattern. We then use a Michelson interferometer to generate and project variable spatial frequency gratings on the perfect target and capture the image of these distorted gratings. We next compute the shape of a filter (transmission or viewing) grating that would cause the desired output from the perfect target input. The computed filter shapes is then converted to NTSC composite video and mixed with the video signal from the target camera. If the target seen matches the perfect target, the desired moir6 output pattern is produced. By using a computer to generate the custom grating which is then converted to a video signal, it is possible to create the arbitrary moiré using video methods while avoiding the expensive and lengthy photolithography process. This allows easily recognizable patterns to be used in inspection systems, quick changes of reference gratings for different patterns, and easy construction of new gratings to test new parts. Examples of arbitrary moiré patterns are shown for different targets. Further development could lead to moiré inspection methods that are suitable for multiple objects, allow quality level sorting, allow optical processing, or have enhanced immunity to misalignment. © 1994 SPIE.

AB  - Black iguana are eaten by human and other predators in Costa Rica. The importance of eye size on avoidance and recovery behaviour of black iguana was examined using an approaching person as the stimulus. Iguanas moved and ran earlier when the approaching person wore a large eye mask than when she wore a smaller eye mask. Iguana response did not vary during the tests as a function of snoutvent length, but response variables were generally correlated. Black iguana clearly moved and ran earlier in response to a large compared with a small eye, indicating they perceive and monitor this feature of predators. © 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Six control dogs, six dogs treated with 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. quinapril, and six dogs treated with 8 mg/kg q.d. minoxidil underwent 6 hours daily of hindquarter compression for 9 weeks. Minoxidil significantly decreased baseline blood pressure (-17 mm Hg; p≤0.01), whereas quinapril decreased baseline blood pressure 11 mm Hg but not significantly (p=0.15). Hindquarter compression elicited blood pressure increases in all three groups (control +18, quinapril +13, minoxidil +19 mm Hg). After 9 weeks, left ventricular mass in control dogs increased 22% (p<0.004); a similar increase was seen in minoxidil-treated dogs (+22%, p<0.0001) but not in the quinapril-treated group (+4%, p<0.15). The increase in left ventricular mass in control dogs was concentric (increased epicardial volume only), whereas in the minoxidil group, the hypertrophy was eccentric (both epicardial and endocardial volumes increased). The minimal hypertrophy in the quinapril group was concentric (no change in epicardial, but a decrease in endocardial volume). Quinapril had little hypotensive effect, but prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas minoxidil did not prevent hypertrophy in spite of its hypotensive effect. The mechanism of this differential effect of direct vasodilation versus converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular hypertrophy is not fully elucidated. The results with quinapril suggest that some antihypertensive agents may positively affect left ventricular hypertrophy in spite of the absence of a large effect on baseline blood pressure or on blood pressure reactivity.

AB  - Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) is a valuable forage legume. Rhizomatous L. corniculatus germplasm from Morocco was recently discovered. Increased persistence may result from rhizomatous habit, because new plants vegetatively generated by rhizomes could replace diseased or dead plants. Rhizome morphology in L. corniculatus from Morocco is unique because taxonomic descriptions for L. corniculatus do not include the presence of rhizomes. The objectives of this study are to describe and compare morphology and anatomy of subterranean lateral shoots (rhizomes) and aerial shoots (stems) of L. corniculatus, Rhizomes of Moroccan L. corniculatus are initiated from axillary buds on basal portions of shoots. The rhizome consists of nodes and internodes, with buds, scale leaves, and adventitious roots occurring at each node. Anatomically, the rhizome of L. corniculatus has a large cortex, small pith, and six to seven primary vascular bundles. No endodermis exists in the cortex, and parenchyma cells contain starch. In contrast, the aerial shoot of L. corniculatus has a small cortex, large pith, and nine to 10 primary vascular bundles. An endodermoid layer is peripheral to the concentric ring of vascular bundles of the aerial shoot, and parenchyma cells in the cortex contain chloroplasts. Morphological and anatomical differences between L. corniculatus rhizomes and aerial shoots are distinguishable.

AB  - We measured fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for a series of eyespots on left and right wings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. F1 offspring were reared in favourable conditions from two groups of selected parents with comparatively low and high FA, respectively. The data suggest that eyespots under strong visual selection from predators may show reduced FA. The results showed no indication of heritable variation for FA and no correlation in FA across eyespots within individuals. An additional experiment showed that a mutant allele specified a novel eyespot which tended to be more asymmetric. Our results indicate that caution is necessary in using FA of specific traits as some genome-level index of developmental stability.

AB  - We have recovered a unique refractory spherule, B6, from the Murchison C2 chondrite. Approximately 170 μm in diameter, it is concentrically zoned, with an outer rim sequence, from outermost to innermost, of aluminous diopside (10 μm thick), anorthite (3 μm), and melilite (3 μm). Inside the melilite layer is a 7 μm-thick, nearly pure layer of spinel. Inward from this layer is a 20-μm wide zone of hibonite laths enclosed in spinel. Inward from this zone, at the core of the inclusion, is CaAl4O7 + perovskite. This is the first reported occurrence of CaAl4O7 in a Murchison inclusion. The sequence of mineral assemblages from the spinel shell inward parallels that expected for crystallization of a melt with the composition of this spherule: 73.2 wt% Al2O3; 17.7% MgO; 6.5% CaO; and 2.5% TiO2. From the bulk composition of the inclusion, distribution of phases, and spherical shape, we conclude that the oxide phases in it, including spinel, crystallized from a liquid. From calculated phase relations in the system Al2O3-MgO-CaO, we infer a melting temperature of ~2100°C, the highest ever inferred for a refractory inclusion. Evidence of a high-temperature history is also seen in the spinel, which, unlike that in most CAIs, contains 1-2 mol% excess Al2O3 relative to stoichiometric MgAl2O4. At this temperature, B6 should have been grossly out of equilibrium (by ~600°C) with a gas of solar composition at 10-3 atm, but no evidence of evaporative loss is seen. The inclusion has a Group II REE pattern and a normal magnesium isotopic composition. The latter observation requires a very brief cooling time, on the order of several seconds. This is consistent with cooling rates calculated for a liquid spherule of the size and composition of B6 undergoing radiative cooling in the solar nebula and constrains the heating mechanism to a small-scale event. We propose the following sequence for the formation of B6: condensation of solid precursors; melting of those precursors in a hypervelocity collision which caused heating of the melt to ~2100°C; rapid formation of the spinel shell, preventing evaporation of the melt; fractional crystallization of the melt; and addition, probably by condensation, of the silicate layers. Corundum and CaAl4O7 are very rarely found in Murchison CAIs. Apparently, most early formed, corundum-rich condensates continued to react with the solar nebula until hibonite, perovskite, and spinel had condensed, forming aggregates which, when melted, gave rise to liquids too rich in TiO2, MgO, and CaO to yield corundum or CaAl4O7 upon cooling. © 1994.

AB  - Annual surveys of winter wheat diseases in England and Wales provide information on the relative severity of the leaf and stem-base disease complex. Septoria tritici was the most damaging disease during the 5-year period 1985-1989 causing annual losses estimated to be 0.329 Mt compared with 0.251 Mt and 0.231 Mt for eyespot and mildew, the next most damaging winter wheat diseases. Annual losses during the period averaged 1.078 Mt excluding losses attributable to the fusarium diseases, for which no satisfactory yield loss relationships are available. Sowing date and length of break from cereals exert a strong influence on incidence of eyespot and losses attributable to the disease and, on the basis of these surveys, growing all winter wheat crops after a 1-year break would prevent national losses of ∼ 100 kt annually. © 1991 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - Using anti-rhodopsin antibody, an immunofluorescence method was established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in order to locate rhodopsin in the cell. The method showed that rhodopsin is located in the membrane near (or around) the pigmented eyespot in green algae. In synchronized cells, the location of rhodopsin changes regularly during the cell cycle. The fluorescence (F) spot moves from the anterior region toward the posterior region of the chloroplast (cp) in the light period. Following cell division, the F spots reappear in each daughter cell whether the daughter cells are released from the mother cell wall or not. The F spot is located opposite the site of the last cleavage furrow whether the cell has divided once, twice, or three times. The F spot moves back toward the anterior region from the equatorial plane after division in the dark period. In white algae eyespot-deficient mutants, rhodopsin does not depend on the presence of the eyespot. The results further showed that rhodopsin resides in the plasmalemma. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Lithological examination of sediments from ∼ 250 sampling stations in the Lake Malawi basin revealed the presence of oolitic and pisolitic sequences at four locations, all lying at depths of ∼ 100-160 m. Geochemical analyses showed the oolites to be comprised of concentric shells of hydrous Fe3+-oxide surrounding siliceous nuclei. They are also conspicuously enriched with Mn, Zn and Pb in adsorbed and reducible oxide phases. Authigenesis of the oolites and pisolites results from the mobilization of Fe2+ in the pore waters of deeply buried anoxic strata and subsequent precipitation of Fe3+ at the sediment-water interface. This process can operate only at those locations with a two-layer oxic-anoxic sediment column, thus explaining the restriction of oolite beds to relatively shallow-water settings in Lake Malawi, where bottom waters are well oxygenated. However, there is no surficial Fe enrichment at shallow sites with predominantly non-clastic or pure silt/clay sediments, suggesting that the availability of both reactive Fe and suitable precipitation nuclei constitute additional controls on oolite formation. The mode of Fe enrichment observed in Lake Malawi may be of some value as a model for more ancient situations, particularly where ironstones have formed in the absence of a definable crustal or volcanogenic Fe source. © 1990.

AB  - The effects of footshock and various light-spot models on the shuttling activity of mice were examined in a passive avoidance situation. It was found that mild footshocks elicited initial exploration followed by an increased tendency to escape from the compartment in which the shocks were administered. An encounter with models, consisting of various numbers of small yellow lights, without footshock did not cause significant differences in shuttling activity. But if the models were paired with footshock, a tendency to explore during the first trial, high readiness to escape, and avoidance learning were found. These were characterized by a temporary increase in number of gate crossings, a decrease in the time spent in the shocked compartment, and a considerable increase in latency to enter the shocked compartment. The most effective model had two horizontally arranged yellow lights, which may share some characteristics with eye-like patterns. © 1994 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - A comparative study of fertile sporophytes has been carried out on seven dictyotalean species from Australia. Patterns of sporangial distribution and development are similar in Zonaria angustata, Zonaria diesingiana, Zonaria spiralis, Zonaria tumeriana and Lobophora variegata but they differ in Homoeostrichus olsenii and Homoeostrichus sinclairii. In Zonaria and Lobophora, sporangia occur in indusiate sori, are embedded in a mucilaginous matrix and, in Z. diesingiana, Z. spiralis and Z. tumeriana, are surrounded by whitish paraphyses. In contrast to Zonaria, the indusiate sporangial sori of H. olsenii form adjacent to concentric rows of brown paraphyses but they lack both mucilage and paraphyses. Sporangia of H. sinclairii occur among dense brown paraphyses which cover the terminal thallus segments. Sporogenesis in species of Zonaria and Lobophora differs conspicuously from other Dictyotalean genera in that nuclear divisions occur when the developing sporangium is quite small, a sporangial stalk cell is not formed and eight spores are released. Sporangial development in H. olsenii, H. sinclairii and in many other genera of the Dictyotales is characterised by the formation of one to three sporangial stalk cells (except in H. sinclairii which forms a multicellular sporangial stalk) and the occurrence of a nuclear division in the mature sporangium to produce four spores. In the mature sporangia of Zonaria, Lobophora and Homoeostrichus, physodes concentrate along the plane of cytokinesis, appear to be involved in the cleavage of the spore protoplasts and, in Zonaria and Lobophora only, their contents are excreted from sporangia during cytokinesis. New characters (presence of sporangial stalk cell, mucilage in the sporangial sorus and differing patterns of sporogenesis) provide further supporting evidence for the recognition of Zonaria and Homoeostrichus as separate genera. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Eyespot colour patterns decorate the wings of many butterfly species. The eyespot is specified in the early pupal epidermis by signals from a central ‘focus,’ and it has been suggested that the focus is the source of a diffusible morphogen gradient. We show that ectopic eyespots can be induced in nonfocal positions throughout the distal, but not the proximal, wing epidermis of Bicyclus anynana by mild epidermal damage inflicted at 12-18 hr (into a 6- to 7-day pupal period). Damage may lower, locally and transiently, the threshold for response to morphogen. Here, we have tested two predictions of the gradient model. As predicted, mild damage close to the focus (parafocal) locally extends the eyespot, making it markedly asymmetrical, even after early operations (1 or 6 hr), when remote epidermis is nonresponsive. Early parafocal operations also have an unexpected result, however, reducing the extent of the eyespot in other directions, perhaps through a long-range ‘wound effect’ on the signaling activity of the focal cells. The model also correctly predicts that increasing the severity of a nonfocal operation will prolong the transient damage and hence give ectopic eyespots after early (1- or 6-hr) operations. We do not, however, find the expected size increase in ectopics induced by the later (12 or 18 hr) severe damage. Similarly, we demonstrate the predicted effect of early (1 or 6 hr) mild damage in increasing the response to a subsequent (18 hr) operation at the same position. The gradient model is therefore supported by most aspects of eyespot induction in response to epidermal damage. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - A new sand-dwelling dinoflagellate. Gymnodium quadrilobatum sp. nov„ is described from the south coast of Natal, South Africa. The organism contains 20-30 chlorop lasts. which are peripherally arranged, and a conspicuous eyespot The motile cell is directly transformed into a non-motile cell and cell division is restricted to the non-motile phase. The motile cell has a typical gymnodinioid organisation, while the non-motile cell possesses a thick cell wall and develops the characteristic cell shape, which is reminiscent of a four-leaved clover. The chloroplasts of G. quadrilobatum belong to an endosymbiotic alga the cytoplasm of which is separated from the host (dinoflagellate) cytoplasm by a single unit membrane. Other organelles contained in the endosymbiont cytoplasm arc the nucleus, ribosomes and mitochondria. The endosymbiont is thought to be a chromophyte alga. The eyespot is bounded by a tnple membrane and is situated in the host cytoplasm. On the basis of the similarities in the ultrastnicture of C. quadrilobatum with those of four thecate dinoflagellatcs. viz. Pendmium balticum, P. foliaceum, P. quinquecome and Peridinium sp.. which are known to possess a similar endosymbiont. possible phylogenetic affinities between G. quadrilobatum and four thecate dinoflagellatcs are discussed. © 1994 The British Phycological Society.

AB  - Detailed petrographic studies of recent or sub-recent evaporites where many critical environmental parameters are defined can help in the analysis of ancient deposits and in the establishment of chemical and environmental models for evaporite formation. The Prungle Lakes are part of the now dry Willandra Lakes system in semi-arid southwestern New South Wales. The Willandra Lakes have been a site of cyclic Quaternary sedimentation in response to the well documented global climatic fluctuations associated with the glacial-interglacial cycle. At times of hydrologic stress, low lake levels are associated with high salt volumes, inherited from evaporative concentration in large shallow lakes upstream and the inflow of saline groundwaters. Thus, at Prungle, a complex array of concentric shorelines, lake floor terraces and lunettes has developed as basin-within-basin landforms which formed in response to filling and drying cycles. Sediments associated with these geomorphic units include: 1. (1) Freshwater littoral, nearshore and deep-water deposited laminated sands and muds, with biogenic carbonates chiefly of ostracodal and algal origin; 2. (2) Evaporites comprising interbedded clay and laminated gypsum-clay couplets, which consist of discrete thin laminae of sugary white euhedral prismatic gypsum separated by detrital clay layers with a high degree of optical orientation. Primary accessory celestite (SrSO4) occurs as discrete patches within the gypsum laminae; 3. (3) Groundwater pyramidal, discoidal or lenticular gypsum crystals, grown from supersaturation produced by evaporation at the capillary fringe of the water table. These have formed displacively within the sediments and caused considerable disruption of the sediment matrix; 4. (4) Aeolian deposition in irregular transverse ridges of sand-sized reworked groundwater gypsum and disrupted lacustrine clays. The gypsum crystals are predominantly discoidal pyramidal forms which are conspicuously oriented parallel to bedding, well sorted and extensively corroded. The clay pellets are well sorted and moderately well rounded. Higher in the profile, bedding is indistinct due to pedogenic processes, which include modification of detrital grains and secondary crystallization of gypsum and carbonate. A thin gypcrete horizon occurs at the surface. The last cycle of sedimentation in the Prungle Lakes is believed, from correlation with lakes higher in the Willandra System, to have occurred during the period 50,000-16,000 yr B.P. Since then groundwaters have dropped below the zone of interaction with the lake floor and surface water no longer reaches the lakes. Sedimentation has ceased and soil formation with secondary carbonate and gypsum has continued to the present. A range of sedimentary environments is identified which depend on strong seasonal oscillations. These environments are virtually absent from the Australian continent today, and their occurrence during the Pleistocene supports the contention of enhanced climatic seasonality at that time. The array of sediment types and mineralogies is almost identical to that characteristic of coastal sabkha sequences highlighting the difficulty of relying on unusual evaporative mineralogy to differentiate marine and non-marine environments. Detailed petrographic analyses of the Prungle sequence have been made in association with a review of theoretical, experimental and observational studies of the environmental controls of calcium sulfate mineralogy and crystal habit. This has enabled the correlation at Prungle of depositional environment with gypsum petrofacies and associated compositional, fabric or structural features. These observations are more generally applicable to other evaporite deposits. Many gypsum evaporites reported in the literature have been compared with this scheme developed at Prungle. © 1991.

AB  - A large variety of animals have developed facial likenesses to common vertebrates, presumably serving to deter attack by their predators. Likenesses run the gamut from unbelievable artistic perfection to ridiculous (to us) caricatures. These images of mock predators may either remain as a constantly visible deterrent or be flashed when an attack is pressed home and combined with rhythmic display simulating counterattack, and a hissing sound capable of startling the predator long enough to enhance escape possibilities. The phenomenon of mimicry is strongly linked to that of the in-traspecific display, especially as the perceptual system of the animals involved become increasingly complex. Thus even the displays of such formidable adversaries as the lion, tiger, falcon and cobra may be seen on closer inspection to involve false faces, often supernormal, and presumably have some signalling function as well. Although mimicry, the evolution of resemblances to other species for protection from predators, has been studied for over a century, the mimicry of faces has not yet received the systematic treatment it seems to deserve. It has even been the brunt of ridicule by avowed evolutionists and shunned by mimicry researchers themselves. Logic and reason have been marshalled on an unbelievable scale to discredit what anyone can now see for himself in the photographs. Most of the cases discussed in this paper have been missed, ignored or dismissed by the experts on either side of the fence. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The performance of concentrically braced steel frames and moment resisting steel frames during the earthquake is examined. Most of the observations confirmed the current knowledge on inelastic response of these structural systems. This permits the anticipation of proper seismic behaviour for buildings designed according to the Canadian building code and standard. Preventing potentially hazardous nonstructural damage, avoiding premature nonductile failures anywhere along the lateral load paths, limiting structural and nonstructural damage due to brace buckling, and accounting for the vertical ground motion are among issues for future consideration. -from Authors

AB  - Phenotypic variation in the wing underside eyespot elements and size variation in female forewing length were analysed in three Australian butterflies of the tropical genus Mycalesis Hübner over 2 years at Cardwell (18°16′S), north‐eastern Queensland. Variation in spot size is strongly seasonal with distinctive wet‐season and dry‐season forms. Adult females of all three species are characterised by smaller ocelli during the dry cooler winter, whereas individuals with larger ocelli predominated throughout the wet hotter summer‐autumn months. Phenotypic change is less pronounced and more gradual in M. sirius, and most dramatic in M. perseus with the dry‐season form also lacking the conspicuous wing underside lines and bands. Dry‐season forms are typically larger (at least in M. perseus and M. terminus), less active, aggregate in moist refugia and often reproductively dormant during the dry season. Wet‐season forms usually reproduce directly and rarely diapause or aggregate. Seasonal polyphenism in these satyrines may be a dry season survival strategy, minimising risk of predation through crypsis during the period when females diapause and aggregate.

AB  - Strange attractor dimensions were determined for two concentric areas of about 220 km (2°) and 440 km (4°) radii around WWSSN station at Shillong based on earthquake data during the period 1964 to 1992. Existence of deterministic chaos for both the areas was supported by the same fractal dimension of 6.1 and positive value of the largest Lyapunov exponent. The results have provided justification for delineating precursory seismicity patterns based on earthquakes up to epicentral distance of 440 km on different fault systems. Conspicuous higher value of the strange attractor dimension in Hindukush, Himalaya and northeast India than that in Koyna region in the peninsular India suggests a new criteria for distinction between interplate and intraplate earthquakes. Differences with subduction zone in Pacific vis-à-vis stress drop in great earthquakes (M ≥ 8) and implications of the chaotic approach in earthquake hazard analysis have also been brought out.

AB  - Abstract.    For three successive years Bicyclus butterflies were caught on a daily basis at a field site in Malawi. Over 5000 butterflies, belonging to five species, were captured. Eight characters describing their plastic wing pattern were measured and analyzed. Broadly speaking, the plasticity is similar for all species, with the wet season forms having conspicuous wing markings (e.g. eyespots), and dry season forms lacking these markings. However, at a more detailed level, each species has its own specific form of plasticity with especially clear differences in the number of intermediate forms. Females generally show a higher degree of plasticity than males. The relative frequencies of intermediate forms and the difference between the sexes are associated with differences between the species in their preference for more open habitats or forests. The species with the most divergent plasticity is also ecologically and phylogenetically comparatively distant from the others. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The vascular amplifier leads to enhancement of all resistance responses, from full dilatation to maximum constriction. The mechanism of resistance amplification is narrowing of the resistance vasculature, which is approximately constant at all levels of vasomotor tone. From the literature, the site of narrowing is localized to the small arteries and large arterioles. The narrowing at rest leads during constriction, to patchy reduction in blood flow in the microcirculation. The enhanced resistance responses of the vascular amplifier during constriction, increase blood pressure (BP) upstream, which minimizes the hemodynamic effects on the microcirculation and helps to maintain venous return. Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is an amplifier of stroke volume and cardiac output. It reinforces the elevation of BP upstream from the site of vascular narrowing. This appears important for the initiation and maintenance of hypertension, in view of findings in SHR showing: (1) that in the course of normal development of hypertension the vascular amplifier properties develop before the onset of hypertension, which occurs in parallel with an increase in rate of LV hypertrophy; (2) after brief periods of enalapril treatment, hypertension redevelops in parallel with the redevelopment of LV hypertrophy, whilst the vascular amplifier properties remain suppressed; (3) treatment with immuno-sympathectomy plus prazosin prevents the development of both LV hypertrophy and hypertension but only produces gradual suppression of the vascular amplifier properties. The role of the sympathetic nervous system on LV-hypertrophy is mediated through α1-adrenoceptors.

AB  - Based on the physiological principles of the muscular force-velocity concept, this paper deals with the special problems associated with determining and interpreting force-velocity relations of muscles in situ particularly in humans. In the strict sense, instead of force-velocity relations merely torque-angular velocity relations of a joint can be measured directly under in situ conditions. This calls for biomechanical model calculations to obtain force-velocity relations of single muscles involved in joint motions. In addition to discussing these basic principles, the methodological problems arising in measurements with so-called isokinetic dynamometers are also explicitly described. An important message of this paper is to sensitize potential users of this method to these problems as the isokinetic dynamometry has more or less become standard procedure worldwide. The possibility of the characterization of muscle fiber composition and the evaluation of power on the basis of human muscle force-velocity relations is also discussed. A final section considers the effects of muscle training on the torque-angular velocity relations. The contents of this paper can be understood as a guide to avoid obtaining conflicting results when measuring human torque-velocity relations.

AB  - A rapid, automated method for isotopic analysis of 13C and 18O in CO2 has been developed. A variety of gas samples containing CO2 can be swept from serological tubes into a helium carrier flow; impurities are separated on a GC column so that a pure pulse of CO2 in He flows into the mass spectrometer. Isotopic ratio determinations are carried out as the pulse passes through the mass spectrometer, allowing a sample to be measured every ∼4 min. A double, concentric needle‐probe is used to flush the sample from the tube so that 100% sample recovery is achieved, maximizing sensitivity and preventing the possibility of fractionation. The precision of the technique, σ(n–1), is better than 0.2‰ (0.0002 atom per cent excess) for 13C and 0.4‰ (0.83 p.p.m.) for 18O for 10 μmol of CO2 at natural abundance. Samples containing only atmospheric concentrations of CO2 can also be analysed. Copyright © 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with a method for centerless grinding of light workpieces having a concentric through hole. The machining accuracy for light workpieces tend to be poor compared with that for solid workpieces. This phenomenon was clarified through geometrical and dynamic analysis of a centerless grinding system companing a regulating wheel, a grinding wheel and a supporting blade. The lead angle of the regulating wheel used to feed a workpiece yields a non-uniform peripheral speed in the axial direction of the regulating wheel. Higher peripheral speed of the regulating wheel induces an upward friction force on the workpiece with a lower peripheral speed. This upward friction force causes an abnormal motion of the workpiece during grinding, which results in inferior machining accuracy. This phenomenon becomes more and more conspicuous on lighter workpieces. © 1991, The Japan Society for Precision Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhizoctonia cerealis, causal agent of sharp-eyespot of cereals, is often observed in wheat crops. Its recent extension is linked to actions taken for controlling eyespot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) Even though results here show that yield losses due to sharp-eyespot are not so important, potential risks for the future are discussed due to the fact that controlling eyespot increases the parasitical activity of R. cerealis. -from English summary

AB  - We have conducted a research on evaluation of adaptability of information acquisition and processing systems to autonomous plant. This paper presents our research on the development of active sensing systems: an active photometric stereo and active sensing systems for detection of specular objects. Since photometric stereo systems normally use multiple light sources fixed to the environment, they cannot avoid shadows caused by surrounding objects. One remedy for this situation is to use a movable light source and to adapt its placement actively to the task environment. Candidate positions for light source placement to avoid shadows are obtained based on a 3-dimensional model of the environment and image processing of a virtual sphere around the target objects. Then possible combinations are evaluated using the combined criteria of reliability and detectability of the measurement. Experimental results, using a light source affixed to a manipulator, demonstrate the usefulness of the setup planning method. To improve the detectability of the active photometric stereo system, an extension has been made by using a movable camera in place of a fixed camera. The extended system utilizes two concentric geodesic domes as a configuration space for planning the light source placement and the camera placement. We also present active sensing systems for detection of specular objects on a flat plane. For the sensor setup planning of a line light source, we have developed another configuration space representation using a geodesic sylinder.

AB  - A sample of full-trained adult male peacocks was collected and measured to determine whether or not there were any morphological correlates of train elaboration. Peacocks with longer or heavier trains are those with relatively large fat reserves for their overall body mass. The proportion of feathers in the train which have eyespots is also greater in peacocks with a relatively large muscle. These relationships indicate that train elaboration may be condition-dependent. Females that prefer males with larger trains may therefore gain good condition males, which may reflect overall genetic quality. There is also a significant lendency for larger-trained peacocks to have high louse loads, after controlling for body mass. It may be that larger-trained males are older, and have accrued more lice than younger ones. Alternatively, long-trained males may have acquired more lice through direct contact with more females than shorter-trained birds.

AB  - Temperature-induced variation and norms of reaction have been analyzed for wing pattern elements of six species belonging to the African butterfly genus Bicyclus (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae). Five of these species are sympatric in Malawi and exhibit seasonal polyphenism in the savannah rainforest ecotone. The sixth species originated from Cameroonian equatorial rainforest. The organisms were laboratory reared under four different temperature conditions ranging from 17-28°C. The variation in response to temperature is described by principal component analysis (PCA). Discrimination on the basis of plastic wing pattern characters was performed by discriminant function analysis (DFA) and unweighed pair-group method algorithm (UPGMA) clustering. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on adaptive plastic wing characters was compared with a cladogram built on 'nonadaptive' characters. Results demonstrate that: (1) Phenotypic plasticity of wing pattern characters in response to temperature in laboratory-reared organisms is reminiscent of variation induced by seasonal change in the field. (2) Different wing pattern characters are under different control: 'exposed' characters of butterflies at rest position are highly sensitive to temperature variation, whereas 'hidden' characters, only visible during active behavior, are dominated by species differences. In general the sensitivity of the former can be attributed to their proposed function in deflecting predators. (3) The sexes differ especially in the size of those eyespots that are displayed during active behavior. (4) Species from seasonal and aseasonal environments react in a broadly similar manner to temperature variation. However savannah species and species of aseasonal rainforest exhibit relatively shallow reaction norms, whereas reaction norms tire steeper in species from the savannah-rainforest ecotone. Such a strong response was also apparent in so-called correlation networks between principal components for these species. (5) Phylogenetic distances are to some extent reflected in ordination in both PCA space and DFA-space: closely related species of the safitza group remain close in both ordinations. The more distantly related species differ in ordination from a pattern as suggested by a phylogenetic reconstruction. It is argued that the wing pattern variation of these species reflects both adaptive processes and historical relationships.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to monitor activity and movement of Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), in a small-farm ecosystem. Moth activity was determined using sticky traps placed in bin vents of storage bins containing shelled corn and pheromone traps placed in concentric circles across the farm with the bins at the center. Moth activity was concentrated in and around the grain bins from June to August and at corn plots in September and October. Mark recapture studies confirmed moth dispersal from the bins to corn plots during July-September. Knowledge of the spatial dynamics of Angoumois grain moth may contribute to pest management programs.

AB  - This paper describes how a double wall filament wound glass fiber reinforced plastic underground storage tank (UST) can be stiffened by a non-removable steel frame mandrel that remains within the tank. A specific design is exhibited to show how a nonmetallic filament-wound UST can be made to have sufficient stiffness to resist, with negligible deflection, a hundred ton load of water and backfill while the tank bottom is unsupported for 66% of its width and as much as 80% of its length. The steel-stiffened double wall UST described in this paper consists of two independent concentric nonmetallic composite pressure vessels, separated by an annular space that has a bottom sump that can be monitored to provide warning of a leaking tank. This paper summarizes the extensive physical and chemical resistance tests conducted by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. to qualify the nonmetallic underground storage tank as meeting the performance requirements outlined in Class 16 of the UL Standard for Safety Subject 1316, which is believed to be the highest standard ever developed for the safe long term underground storage of flammable liquids. Some details relating to the cost and performance characteristics of the steel-stiffened nonmetallic composite tank are presented.

AB  - Various forms of hydroxyapatite (HAP) materials have been developed for use as bone grafts. Since the risk of local infection is associated with surgery, it seems reasonable to incorporate drugs such as antibiotics into implant materials. We therefore investigated the characteristics of drug incorporation into a spherical porous HAP bead (diameter = 8.48 mm, bulk porosity = 0.439) and its in vitro release behavior. Cefotiam (CTM) was used as a model antibiotic. Because of nonuniform pore distribution in the bead, distribution of CTM was estimated from the amounts of CTM experimentally determined at three different sites: the surface, halfway to the center, and the center of the beads. The results indicated that 90% of the drug was incorporated in the concentric outer 0.387 (radius = 1) section of the bead. CTM was released with a short lag time when the dry HAP bead was placed in water. Incorporation of CTM with egg phosphatidylcholine eliminated initial lag time and decreased the release rate of the drug from the bead. The lipid load was useful in controlling the release of CTM from the beads. In addition, to protect relatively unstable drugs from humidity and avoid contamination of drug‐incorporated HAP beads an apparatus was designed with which the beads could be enclosed in vials in vacuo and under aseptic conditions on a bench‐scale basis.

AB  - This study examined acute systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure responses within passive and modified proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching techniques. Nonhypertensives (N = 60) were assigned to one of three treatment groups. Group 1 employed an antagonist passive stretch (APS), 6-sec maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the antagonist, and subsequent APS. Group 2 employed an APS, a 6-sec MVIC of the antagonist, submaximal concentric contraction of the agonist, and APS. Group 3 was similar to Group 2, with the deletion of an MVIC prior to the concentric contraction. Blood pressures were obtained during rest, baseline following passive stretch, and at the end of the three phases of the PNF technique. Range of motion (ROM) data were collected for baseline and treatment in terminal hip flexion for each group. All PNF treatments were effective for increasing ROM. One or two trials of PNF improve ROM and avoid increasing SBP, while a third trial increases SBP.

AB  - In order to study the effect of environment and multiaxial stress states on subcritical crack growth behavior of machinable ceramics containing mica flakes in a glass matrix, dynamic fatigue tests (constant stressing rate tests) were conducted by four point bending of plates (uniaxial tension), concentric ring loading of disks (equibiaxial tension), and diametral compression of disks (tension-compression) under different environments of air, water, and vacuum. The subcritical crack growth parameters, n, were determined from the stressing rate dependence of the fracture toughness value in both air and water environments. In any case of multiaxial stress states, the n value obtained in a water environment was obviously higher than that in an air environment. Furthermore, multiaxial stress effects were exhibited with a somewhat higher n value under equibiaxial tensile stress state in an air environment, and with a significantly lower n value under a tension-compression stress state in both air and water environments. These tendencies can be explained by the facts that in the biaxial stress state crack branching and formation of multiple cracks occurs easily with the absence of a strong orientation dependence for crack growth and with the existence of mica grains dispersed in the matrix, whereas in the tension-compression stress state the strong orientation dependence of the stress intensity at the crack tip prevents the crack from going around the mica grains. © 1993, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The preferential development of giant mitochondria and their nuclei (nucleoids) in the egg cells of Pelargonium zonale Ait. during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis was examined by fluorescence microscopy, after Technovit embedding and 4',6-di-amidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI) staining, fluorimetry for DNA content, using a video- intensified microscope photon-counting system (VIMPICS), and by three- dimensional reconstruction of mitochondrial nuclei (mt-nuclei). Reproductive cells during the megaspore mother cell, meiosis, tetrad, and functioning megaspore stages contained many small mitochondria with characteristic, uniformly DAPI-stained mt-nuclei about 0.3 μm in diameter, containing a small amount of DNA (0.3 Mbp). During formation of the 2-, 4-, and 8-nucleate embryo sac, mt-nuclei did not markedly change in shape or DNA content. When the embryo sac formed and differentiation of each cell began, mitochondria and their nuclei in the egg cell took on a small ring or string-like shape. Accompanying the maturation of the embryo sac, they underwent progressive enlargement and gradually altered to long thick strings, or slacks of concentric or half concentric rings. By flower opening, they have developed to an extremely large size. One of these stacks of mt-nuclei was reconstructed in three dimensions: each ring in the stack was cup- or plate- shaped; 5 to 10 rings made up the stack, though each remained discontinuous from the others. From serial sections, we counted 44 mitochondria in one egg cell. Fluorometry using VIMPICS revealed that DNA amount within the stacked mitochondrion increased to 40 times that of the megaspore mother cell stage; a single stack of mitochondria contained 340-1700 Mbp DNA; which means that one egg cell contains at least 15000 Mbp mt-DNA, a value greater than the cell-nuclear DNA content.

AB  - The analysis of land use maps and enquiries in the Izmir district of Turkey showed three separate periods of varying innovation diffusion: concentric diffusion of innovation emanating from an urban centre in accordance with the Hagerstrand model characterize an initial period. In the second period, structural changes caused by these early innovations, together with the almost total diffusion of information on the possibilities of innovation in the field of agriculture by the media, have reduced such dependence on distance when spreading further innovations. Since the present innovation potential is growing with increasing distance from the urban centre, it must be assumed that future diffusion of innovations will run centripetally, i.e. from the periphery to the urban centre. -English summary

AB  - Beyond early coronary vascularitis and focal; eccentric atheroma, it is necessary to insist on graft accelerated atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis (AAC) called chronic rejection, whose histologic lesions are particular, because diffuse, concentric, distal, with a rapid evolution, cause of little myocardial infarctions, often multiple. Occuring above all after one year post transplant, the incidence of AAC is to 50% at 5 years. It is the first cause of mortality during years following transplantation. Insidious, often without clinical symptoms, AAC is not well disclosed by classic diagnostic methods of coronary insufficiency. Coronarography is the better diagnostic method but intravascular ultrasound is in progress likely. Physiopathology is unknown but an immune theory is the most common. There is no efficient preventive treatment and retransplantation is the only way impaired ventricular function of the graft occurs. By-pass and transluminal angioplasty are rarely feasible.

AB  - A commercially available thermal-infrared scanning system was used to survey populations of several wildlife species. The system's ability to detect species of different sizes in varying habitats relative to conventional survey methods, to differentiate between species in the same habitat, and the influence of environtmental factors on operational aspects of employing this technology in the field were evaluated. Total costs for the surveys were approximately $0.36/ha. There were marked discrepancies in the counts of untrained observers and those from trained analysis. Computer-assisted analysis of infrared imagery recorded 52% fewer deer than were estimated from drive counts, and densities of moose were five times those estimated from conventional aerial methods. By flying concentric circles and using telephoto, detailed counts of turkeys and deer were possible. With the aid of computer-assisted analysis, infrared thermography may become a useful wildlife population survey tool. More research is needed to verify the actual efficiency of detection by combining aerial scans with ground truthing for a variely of species and habitals. © 1995 Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.

AB  - Response of male eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermüller), to different ratios of synthetic sex pheromone components, (Z)-8-tetradecenyl acetate (Z8-14:OAc) and (Z)-8-tetradecenyl alcohol (Z8-14:OH), were compared in four North American locations and in one location in The Netherlands. In British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Michigan, and The Netherlands, a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH captured significantly more male S. ocellana than Z8-14:OAc alone or binary blends containing 10-50%Z8-14:OH. In Ontario, where population sizes were low compared to the other four locations, trends in trap catches were similar, and there was no indication that male S. ocellana responded differently to the tested pheromone blends. A 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH should be most effective in pheromone-based control programs of S. ocellana in North America and in The Netherlands. Our results confirm earlier studies that a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH captures significantly more male S. ocellana than Z8-14:OAc alone. However, our finding that a 99:1 blend of Z8-14:OAc and Z8-14:OH is significantly more attractive than binary blends containing 10-50%Z8-14:OH differs from previous findings in Germany and Switzerland. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Abstract.    Seasonal polyphenism is studied in a community of five African butterflies of the genus Bicyclus at the transition between a wet and a dry season from May to July. Butterflies characterized by large eyespots and, especially in B.sufitza (Hewitson), a pale band (the wet season form) are replaced over this period by butterflies lacking conspicuous wing markings (the dry season form, dsf). The latter butterflies also tend to be larger, but more variable in size. Butterflies of an intermediate phenotype are recruited over a comparatively short interim period. This turnover coincides with a period of declining temperature and drying of the habitat, including the grasses on which larvae feed. Butterflies are progressively more likely to rest on brown leaf litter rather than on green herbage. A relationship with temperature is supported by laboratory experiments with B.saJitza and B.anynana (Butler) showing that increasingly extreme dsf butterflies develop with decreasing rearing temperature in the final larval instar. Some differences in behaviour and activity were observed between the seasonal forms. Butterflies of the dsf develop ovarian dormancy and fat bodies. They can survive to reproduce at the beginning of the rains in November. Capture‐recapture experiments showed that the adult butterflies have a comparatively long life expectancy and are quite sedentary. The results are discussed in relation to a hypothesis linking the polyphenism to seasonal changes in resting background and selection for crypsis. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The present study was designed to explore to what extent pressure reduction by antihypertensive therapy and pressure elevation by renal hypertension are able to affect structural vascular and cardiac changes in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Pressure elevation in SHR was induced by means of superimposing 2 kidney, 1 clip renal hypertension (2K1C). Pressure reduction was achieved by means of the vasoselective calcium antagonist felodipine from 6 to 13 weeks of age in both clipped and unclipped SHR. Vascular structure of the skeletal muscle was assessed hemodynamically by perfusing a hindlimb preparation and left ventricular dimensions were calculated from pressure/volume relationships of isolated hearts arrested in diastole. Induction of renal hypertension in SHR resulted, besides augmentation of arterial pressure in a marked concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, i.e. elevations of wall thickness to internal radius ratio. Likewise, in renal hypertensive SHR, a structural adaptation of the skeletal muscle vascular bed occurred, reflected as elevations of minimal vascular resistance and maximal generated perfusion pressure. Antihypertensive treatment for 8 weeks with felodipine reduced and also prevented mean arterial pressure from increasing further in SHR, and in SHR with superimposed renal hypertension by approximately 15% (p<; 0.001 for both). In renal hypertensive SHR, felodipine partly prevented the development of exaggerated structural changes, both in the heart and in the skeletal muscle vascular bed, as reflected by reduced wall thickness to internal radius ratio and reduced minimal vascular resistance by 22% and maximal pressure response by 10% respectively (p <; 0.01 for both parameters). Felodipine treatment in young SHR without renal hypertension changed neither wall thickness to internal radius ratio of the left ventricle, nor minimal vascular resistance and maximal pressor response in the hindlimb. Felodipine only partially prevented the development of media hypertrophy of the resistance vessels, and of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy in young renal hypertensive SHR. In young ordinary SHR, when the cardiovascular system mainly adapts in concert with body growth, felodipine treatment had little effect on either cardiac or vascular structure despite a blood pressure lowering effect. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, exhibits seasonal polyphenism. The wet season form has large eyespots and a pale band while these characters are much less conspicuous or absent in the dry season form. This plasticity is induced in the laboratory by use of a standard series of constant temperatures in the larval stage yielding a continuous norm of reaction. Butterflies in this study were reared from hatchling larvae in seven regimes which differed with respect to thermoperiod or photoperiod. The effect of rearing treatment on the phenotypic plasticity of the adult wing pattern, on life history traits and on larval feeding rhythms was investigated. Photoperiod had little effect except that constant light produced a higher mortality and tended to produce a longer development time. Thermoperiod had a major effect on the life history traits in comparison to a constant temperature regime with the same daily mean: development time was shorter with higher growth rates. The faster development was associated with a substantial shift in the wing pattern towards the wet season form. Larvae feed mostly at night both under constant and thermoperiod (cool nights) conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the necessity of matching field and laboratory environments in studies of norms of reaction or of life history traits where the adaptive significance of the variation is important. Fluctuating conditions in nature, especially with respect to thermoperiod, must be taken into account. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - We have investigated techniques to conduct a valid single-increment compression experiment to large strains, ε ≈ 1.0. Our investigation included experiments with many different lubricants, specimen-end geometries, five different materials, and temperatures of 22 °C, 315 °C, and 600 °C. We found that for materials with a work-hardening exponent greater than 0.15 and a slightly positive strain-rate sensitivity, the best technique was to cut concentric grooves into the ends of the compression sample and to use polished platens and a molybdenum-disulfide greasebase lubricant. This technique gave valid stress/strain data and uniform displacement fields (as determined by metallography of the deformed specimen cross sections). At all temperatures, satisfactory results were also obtained using a MOLYKOTE spray lubricant. We investigated both well-lubricated experimental conditions (the concentric specimen grooves and Molygrease lubrication and TEFLON sheet lubrication) as well as poor lubrication conditions. The poorest lubrication was achieved by using a set of platens which had grooves cut in them to prevent any expansion by the ends of the specimen during deformation. Up to a compressive strain of 0.5, the load/displacement data from all of these lubrication conditions were almost identical. This was the case for materials with a work-hardening exponent >0.15. Despite the similarity of the "average" stress/strain data to ε = 0.5 for all lubrication conditions, metallographic cross sections showed that the deformation was nonuniform for the poorly lubricated experiments. The results of the experiments show that a single increment compression test can be used to obtain accurate constitutive behavior of many materials to large deformations, ε ≈ 1.0. In addition, we have found that the compression test is relatively insensitive to lubrication conditions for many materials through moderate deformations, ε ≈ 0.5. © 1992 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International.

AB  - This paper describes the development of the fittings, such as elbows, tees and reducers, of a mechanical-bonding double-wall pipe for sour gas service. The pipe consists of an outer carbon steel and an inner corrosion-resistant alloy pipe. Elbows were successfully made by hot bending with expansion by mandrel. Tees were produced by cold bulging, the combination of internal pressure and axial load. Reducers were formed by reducing or expanding the double-wall pipe. Wrinkles appeared in the inner pipe at a reduction in diameter beyond 20%. A new method (triple wall method) was developed to enlarge the limit of forming of reducers. A dummy pipe was inserted in the double-wall pipe and prevented wrinkles from appearing. Concentric reducers with a reduction in diameter of about 40% and eccentric reducers were successfully produced by the new method. All of fittings were heat treated after forming and showed good mechanical properties and corrosion-resistance.

AB  - 1. While collecting nectar in hovering flight the European hawk moth Macroglossum stellatarum efficiently regulates its distance relative to flowers that are shaken by wind. This can be demonstrated in laboratory experiments by moving dummy flowers (blue cardboard disks) towards and away from the feeding animal (Fig. 1). 2. Distance regulation is predominantly mediated by visual cues. Mechanoreceptors on the proboscis appear to contribute little to the response. 3. Movements of dummy flowers can be simulated by expanding and contracting a pattern projected onto a screen. With this technique we investigated the dynamical properties of the servo mechanism underlying distance regulation. The system behaves as a bandpass filter with corner frequencies of 0.15 and 5 Hz (Figs.2,3). 4. When a high-speed ramp-like movement of the flower is simulated, there is an asymmetry in the response. During simulated approach the reaction is phasic-tonic with a pronounced overshoot at the beginning, during simulated retraction it remains tonic (Fig.5B,C). 5. During distance regulation the animals compensate for the speed of the edge of the projected pattern. Distance regulation improves substantially when the number of stimulated elementary movement detectors is increased through increasing the number of contour lines by projecting concentric rings instead of a homogeneous disk (Figs.7, 8). © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The problem of initial fire spread over fuel-soaked ground was experimentally modeled in detail using a bed of glass beads saturated with n-decane as the fuel. After igniting the center of the horizontal fuel-soaked surface, the flame spreads concentrically and formed a growing centered flame pillar. The radial spread velocity of flame pillar base accelerated during the initial fire growth stage. The dominant mode of heat transfer controlling the spread of the flame pillar base was by flame radiation. The present study shows some important and fundamental characteristics of the growing flame pillar by using the direct video movie, Schlieren photography, particle trace technique, radiation flux measurement and temperature measurement. The study considers the spread velocity of the flame pillar base, behavior of the flame pillar, luminous height of the flame as a function of flame base diameter, frequency of flame height fluctuation as a function of flame base diameter, flow pattern of flame-induced convection, variation of flame radiation heat flux with elapsed time, and profile and fluctuation of local gas phase temperature on the axis of flame pillar. From the point of view of prevention of subsequent fire hazard, the present study discusses some important experimental results for the development of fire size and flame radiation during the initial stages of a growing flame pillar on the ground which has been soaked by spilled liquid fuels. © 1992.

AB  - A novel use of selection was applied to the examination of the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. The approach provides a sensitive way of detecting genotype-environment (g x e) interactions and also allows the form of any interactions across an environmental gradient to be investigated through changes in the shapes of the reaction norms. The wing pattern of the butterfly B. anynana varies with season; eyespot size increases with development temperature. Selection lines to increase and to decrease eyespot size at 28°C were carried out. The effect of selection on the eyespot reaction norms with temperature was examined. Selection produced divergent reaction norms across the entire range of temperature in most eyespots. Significant g x e interactions were sometimes present but the degree of interaction was always relatively small. When present, the form of the interaction varied between the sexes. There was a high degree of genetic independence between the eyespots on the ventral and on the dorsal wing surfaces, except in the dorsal eyespot in the wing cell corresponding to the wing cell of the selected ventral wing surface eyespot. The significance of the results for the maintenance of genetic variation in B. anynana is considered. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

AB  - Contraction-induced injury results in the degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers. Of the three types of contractions-shortening (concentric), isometric, and lengthening (eccentric)-injury is most likely to occur and the severity of the injury is greatest during lengthening contractions. The magnitude of the injury to muscle fibers may be assessed by direct measures of cellular and ultrastructural damage; by indirect measures of changes in enzyme efflux, calcium influx, ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione, and force development; and, in human beings, by reports of muscle soreness. The sequence of events includes an initial injury that is primarily mechanical and a secondary metabolic, or biochemical, injury that peaks 1 to 3 days after the injurious contractions. The recovery from contraction-induced injury is usually complete within 30 days. Repeated exposures to protocols of lengthening contractions result in 'trained' muscles that are not injured by the protocol that previously caused injury.

AB  - The numbers of laboratory-reared males of Chilo partellus (SWINHOE) which were released, both in a screenhouse and in the field, and recaptured in virgin female-baited traps were positively correlated. Pheromone trap catches were reduced by 75–100% when 18 or 36 virgin females were placed in two concentric circles of radii 10 m and 20 m occupying an area of 1,257 sq m. around the trap. Mated females surrounding the trap did not cause a significant decrease in the trap catch. Tethered virigin females surrounding a virgin female-baited trap competed successfully among themselves and with the trap for receptive males, the percentage of the tethered mated females being 58–66% and the catch in the trap reducing by 78–86% compared with that in the control. Thus, although catches of males in pheromone traps increased with the increase in their population density, the efficiency of the trap decreased due to competition with increasing number of calling females in the trap vicinity. The disruption in the catch was not accompanied by a corresponding reduction in mating. The results also demonstrated competition among pheromone traps. © 1991, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved.

AB  - Black pigment extracted from wings of Precis coenia was identified as melanin by solubility characteristics and incorporation of radiolabeled melanin precursors. Different colours in wing scales appeared successively, starting with white followed by red, black and grey pigments. At corresponding times [14C]-tyrosine and [14C]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine injected into pupae were incorporated most intensively into black and grey scales. By contrast, red scales were labeled by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and, to a lesser extent, by tyrosine when injected at the time of red pigment synthesis. Labeled β-alanine, a component of the sclerotizing agent N-β-alanyldopamine, was incorporated into all scales with the exception of intensely black scales. It is discussed whether the mechanical stability of black scales may be due to melanin itself whereas the stability of all other scales may be due to N-β-alanyldopamine. Amounts of extractable melanin increased during visible pigment formation in black and grey scales. When [14C]-tyrosine was offered to isolated wings in Grace's medium before melanization, 93% of incorporated activity was found in the hydrolysable fraction and only 7% in the melanin fraction. However, when supplied during intensive melanin synthesis up to 70% was incorporated into melanin. The same incorporation pattern resulted after injection into intact developing pupae. Incorporation of [14C]-tyrosine into melanin began earlier, and was higher in presumptive black scales than in grey scales. Incorporation into white scales was always low. DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) activity in whole wings was low during the pupal stage but increased at the time when scale melanization started. DDC activity in different coloured wing pieces increased first in presumptive black pattern elements, the eyespots. DDC activity in the eyespots was 3.5 times higher than in presumptive white parts of the wing; it was intermediate in grey areas. This demonstrates that wing colour pattern as well as colouration intensity are related to selective activity of DDC in time and different locations resulting in different amounts of melanin in grey and black scales. © 1995.

AB  - The acid phosphatase activity during carposporogenesis in Gigartina and tetrasporogenesis in Chondria was studied using the Gomori technique. During the first steps of gonimoblast maturation of Gigartina, portions of cytoplasm are ensheathed by ER cisternae with acid phosphatase activity, giving rise to autolysosomal concentric membrane bodies. In a similar way large mucilage sacs are severed. They extrude their contents in a kind of exocytosis. Multivesicular bodies, concentrically arranged cisternae and extracytoplasmic compartments, each with acid phosphatase activity, remain in young carpospores for some time, probably as remnants of the autophagocytotic and exocytotic events. The Golgi apparatus is poorly developed in gonimoblast cells and young carpospores. It becomes a prominent cell component in maturing carpospores and then participates in cell wall formation. Only some of the dictyosomal cisternae contain acid phosphatase; these are irregularly distributed in the dictyosome. - In pre- and postmeiotic tetraspore mother cells of Chondria massive lead deposits are found in the dictyosomes and in adjacent Golgi vesicles. Finer lead precipitates occur in ER cisternae, especially in those which are sequestering starch-grain-containing portions of the cytoplasm to give rise to autolysosomes. During cell cleavage, the dictyosomes aggregate. They become devoid of acid phosphatase activity with the exception of vesicles at the trans face. Later, Golgi stacks associate and have common, Gomori positively reacting, narrow cisternae at the cis face. The Golgi apparatus derived "cored vesicles" do not contain lead precipitates whereas the Golgi cisternae in the final stage of tetrasporogenesis show acid phosphatase activity. Variations in acid phosphatase distribution are explained in the light of current models of membrane flow. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In on-line contingency analysis, it has become quite common to screen contingencies by ranking them according to some severity (or performance) index, which is calculated solely as a measure of limit violations. Quite often, however, even large limit violations may not be of concern if they are easily correctable whereas indications of noncorrectable violations may require preventive action. This paper focuses on the idea of correctability of contingencies with limit violations. A fast and efficient method for the correction of line loading limit violations based on sensitivity factors and contingency screening techniques using sparse vector handling is presented. The results show that the additional information about correctability of contingencies can be obtained at a low computational cost. © 1993 IEEE

AB  - Sexual reproduction in Splachnidium rugosum is anisogamous. Sporophytes produce unilocular sporangia in conceptacles. In culture, zoospores developed into filamentous gameto- phytes which remained sterile but occasionally gave rise to sporophytes directly. Wild gametophytes become fertile during spring and summer. They are dioecious and bear conical plurilocular gametangia. Male gametangia are distinguished from females by their orange colour and smaller loculi, Male gametes are smaller than female gametes and possess a smaller chloroplast with a more conspicuous eyespot. Plasmogamy occurs rapidly after female gametes have settled and withdrawn their flagella. Female gametes are capable of parthenogenesis and develop into more female gametophytes. Male gametes germinate but fail to develop beyond a few cells. Chromosome counts gave 20-24 for wild sporophytes and eight-10 for wild gametophytes, and it is inferred that meiosis occurs in unilocular sporangia. During sporogenesis, the characteristic stellate chloroplast with an internal pyrenoid temporarily assumes a simpler form with a lateral pyrenoid. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Freezing rate effect was analyzed, together with the addition of triglycerides to model suspensions of commercial corn starch (7 and 10%, w/w) with and without xanthan gum (0.3%, w/w). Transient curves of shear stress of samples thawed under controlled conditions were recorded with a concentric cylinders viscometer. The Bird-Leider model was used to obtain the viscoelasticity and structural breakdown parameters for the different systems, obtaining satisfactory fitting. The lipid phase modified the viscoelastic properties of the model systems. In all cases, the ultra-rapidly frozen systems maintained the textural characteristics of the unfrozen samples. The addition of only 0.3% of xanthan gum protected the suspensions from the negative effect attributed to low freezing rates.

AB  - Unstable dorsal fracture dislocations of the PIP joint of a finger commonly result in joint stiffness following immobilization or open reduction and internal fixation (Green and Rowland, 1984). The Agee dynamic external fixator, or force couple splint (Agee, 1978Agee, 1987), was introduced in an attempt to avoid this complication and maintains a concentric reduction whilst allowing a full range of joint movement. The splint is constructed from three Kirschner wires and is activated by a single rubber band. A force couple is created across the proximal interphalangeal joint levering the base of the middle phalanx towards the palm whilst simultaneously lifting the distal end of the proximal phalanx dorsally to restore joint reduction. However, this technique is not without complications (Agee, 1987). We report a swan-neck deformity resulting from this treatment. © 1995, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - A simple method is presented to assess, on a regional scale, the contamination-risk of shallow aquifers covered by cracking clay soils, with special emphasis on preferential flow of contaminants through shrinkage cracks. A water extraction area of several hundred hectares is divided into units with homogeneous soil types and hydrological conditions. For each unit, a one-dimensional computer simulation model is used to compute residence times in the unsaturated zone of the cracking clay soils. Analytical equations are used to estimate residence times in the saturated zone. Finally, a classification system is proposed to summarize and visualize the model computations in a simple way. The developed method is illustrated with a case study from the Netherlands. It is known how contamination-risk maps of water extraction areas can be obtained. Policies to prevent contamination of the aquifer can be focused on the most vulnerable areas as indicated on such a map. The contamination-risk maps, obtained using the present method, deviate sharply from the traditional, more or less concentric protection zones, computed with saturated groundwater flow models. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The approximately concentric arrangement of layered deposits and dune fields at the two Martian poles may reflect a nearly steady state dispersal of material from the polar deposits. Data on effective surface winds from high resolution Viking Images combined with theory of local winds suggest that the northern dunes are in part confined to a latitude band by winds generated by their own low albedo. Dispersal of the dark sand from the southern polar region is not subject to this kind of feedback because the irregular topography prevents areal accumulations sufficiently extensive to produce winds. -Authors

AB  - Al2O3-TiC ceramic tools are used for finish machining of cast iron. But these tools break easily in wet cutting. In order to overcome this problem, the cutting performance of hyperfunctional Al2O3-TiC ceramic tools with symmetrically graded structures of Al2O3/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al2O3 ere studied. Two hyperfunctional ceramic tools with different types of layering were fabricated by SHS/HIP processes. Al2O3-TiC ceramic tools with symmetrically graded structure of concentric layers showed good breakage resistance in wet cutting as compared with monolithic Al2O3-TiC ceramic tools fabricated using the same process. Numerical calculation using the finite element method (FEM) showed that the Al2O3-TiC ceramic tools with the symmetrically graded structure of concentric layers had strong residual compressive stress at the edge of the tool in the direction parallel to the edge. It seemed that this compressive stress was effective in preventing breakage. © 1995, Japan Society of Powder and Powder Metallurgy. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persea-type forest was defined as lucidophyllous forest dominated by canopy trees of P. thunbergii, Elaeocarpus sylvestris var. ellipticus, Cinnamomum japonicum, C. camphora, Daphniphyllum teijsmannii, Neolitsea sericea, Litsea lancifolia, Ilex integra, I. rotunda, Osmanthus insularis, Prunus zippeliana, Turpinia ternata, Podocarpus macrophyllus, Ardisia sieboldii, and Ternstroemia gymnanthera. These species have endozoochorous seed dispersal by birds and are highly resistant to the action of sea wind with salt. Persea-type forest was located almost exclusively in narrow coastal areas, 300 m from the nearest coastline, as a preclimax in littoral areas affected by the NW winter monsoon, typhoons or severe sea wind. The forest was divided into 14 types according to the dominant canopy trees. E. sylvestris var. ellipticus-dominated forest was distributed concentrically in coastal areas from the Kii Channel to the Seto Inland Sea on the Shikoku side. -from English summary

AB  - Conventional theoretical treatments of sonic logging consider the borehole, mudcake, and invaded zone to be concentric cylinders, each possessing uniform mechanical properties. Because of the simplicity of these models, there is naturally some question as to whether modeled results remain valid inside rugose wellbores. An elliptical borehole represents both the simplest possible rugosity and the approximate effect of tectonic stresses on an initially circular hole. Unfortunately, classical separation of variables fails to provide a closed-form solution to this boundary value problem. This forced previous authors to base their analysis on dubious ray theory arguments (Willis et al, 1982). In this paper, we have attacked the problem of sonic logging in an elliptical borehole in a more systematic fashion-by developing a perturbation series in ϵ, the borehole eccentricity. © 1983 SEG Annual Meeting.

AB  - In microgravity, soot accumulates inside the flame in droplet combustion. The yellow luminosity prevents the inner structure of the flame from being revealed. No experimental work has been conducted on the flame structure of the droplet burning in microgravity. Microgravity experiments on the droplet burning were performed for the purpose of clarifying the flame structure of spherically symmetrical burning of the droplet by using the drop tower. Gas temperature was measured by thermocouples with tip parts that are concentric with the spherical flame. This configuration reduces heat loss from the contact point of the thermocouple to the supporting wires. The gas-temperature distributions and temporal variations of the flame temperature were obtained and were examined for an ambient pressure ranging from 0.1 to 1.1 MPa. As results, it was found that the maximum temperature zone, that is, the primary reaction zone, exists about 0.8 mm outside the outer edge of the yellow luminous zone at 0.1 MPa for n-heptane droplets. The distance between the reaction zone and the outer edge of the yellow luminous zone decreases with increasing ambient pressure. The flame temperature is almost constant at the normalized time ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 and less dependent on the ambient pressure than on oxygen concentration of the ambient gas. In the later period of combustion, the flame temperature decreases with time because of the increase in the soot accumulation. © 1994 Combustion Institute.

AB  - Jurassic hornblende gabbros intrude as a conspicuous 9 km2 arcuate complex within Paleozoic metasedimentary pendants of the Shadow Mountains, San Bernardino County, California. This complex is significant because it: (1) displays evidence of processes active in magma chambers which are crystallizing cumulus phases; (2) resembles many mid-Mesozoic plutons described in the western and central Sierra Nevada and western Mojave desert which may all be petrologically related; and (3) may be used as a diagnostic tectonic marker for Mesozoic tectonic reconstructions of the Mojave Desert and western Cordillera. The gabbroic body is unusual for its compact, near-circular plan, conspicuous banding and layering and reverse geochemical zonation. The mafic complex was intruded as a hydrous magma and was emplaced as a concentric epizonal pluton. Oxygen isotopic data indicate the melt was mantle derived but has been contaminated by assimilation of metasediments. The gabbro was likely generated by reaction of olivine with fractionated melt from the melting of a low MgO basalt under water-saturated conditions. The banding and layering is ascribed to the cyclic ascent of felsic rejected solute along the walls of the chamber and its accumulation near the roof of the complex. Cooling was facilitated by conduction and the presence of pendant rocks at uppermost levels. The Shadow Mountains gabbros resemble other gabbroic bodies of similar Jurassic age throughout the Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert and Transverse Ranges, California (Labren and Schweickert, 1994; Miller and Glazner, 1995). These intrusions are useful as markers of subsequent large-scale tectonic crustal displacements affecting the western Mojave Desert and Sierra Nevada. In particular, the Shadow Mountains gabbros show age, mineralogic and textural affinities with correlative gabbroic complexes in the central Sierra Nevada 400 km to the north. All these plutonic bodies may represent subvolcanic sources of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Independence dike swarm in the western Mojave Desert and eastern Sierra Nevada.

AB  - An increasing amount of research is focused on the functional future of subjects with spinal cord injuries. In addition to studies on metabolic responses and wheelchair propulsion techniques, these studies have been aimed at defining and preventing traumatisms in paraplegic wheelchair sportsmen. 2 groups of 6 paraplegic sportsmen with different neurological levels (HPS and LPS) and 1 group of 6 valid sportsmen (VS) underwent isokinetic evaluation of muscular power developed by the shoulder. The flexion-abduction-external rotation/extension-adduction-internal rotation for concentric-concentric connection were carried out at 3 speeds, 60 degrees/s, 120 degrees/s and 210 degrees/s on the right side and the left side. We studied work and power parameters and completed this analysis by determination of agonist/antagonist ratios for shoulder muscles. The results of the isokinetic evaluation demonstrated that wheelchair sportsmen with neurological levels inferior to T10 (LPS), thus with abdominal muscle and stabilization capacities in the sitting position, showed better and significantly different torque and power than high neurological level sportsmen (HPS) and valid sportsmen (VS) (p < 0.001). In addition, the neurological level had an effect on isokinetic power developed by the scapular belt and also wheelchair propulsion modified the torque produced. The comparison between HPS and LPS during extension movements showed significant differences in maximal work per repetition (p < 0.001), total work (p < 0.001) and power (p < 0.01). We observed also that wheelchair propulsion led to specific development of muscular capacities and power, only for wheelchair sportsmen with balance and stabilization capacities in the sitting position. This study showed that for the agonist/antagonist ratio, the 3 parameters of maximal work per repetition, total work and power, often showed agonist/antagonist ratios between 30% and 40% and even more than 30% in our test conditions. Similar ratios were noted for the 3 groups of subjects, thus representing an imbalance in the agonist muscle masses of the shoulder. Tnis may be one factor in traumatism and pain. We consider that further studies, involving other functional parameters, are necessary to define behavioural capacities and prevention factors relative to wheelchair sports activities.

AB  - We have designed and tested a compact heat switch that has a simple design and a very large ON/OFF ratio. The design uses concentric cylinders of copper that can be fabricated with higher precision and with thinner web thickness than other designs. It is assembled with a technique that carefully controls the narrow gap between adjacent segments. These features allow a very large surface area for conduction to be fitted into a small volume. The conduction medium is liquid or gaseous 3He which is put into or taken out of the switch by a small nearby charcoal pump in order to avoid an external mechanical pump and a long pump line. Measurements of its performance down to 1 K show an ON/OFF conduction ratio of approximately 4000.

AB  - The effectiveness of two types of eyespot balloons at causing avoidance by birds was examined in a flight cage using three captive doves, Streptopelia orientalis. A field where soybean seeds were systematically placed was divided into several plots in which the following three treatments were applied: placing of balloons with and without eyespots and no placing of balloons. The effectiveness of balloons was compared in terms of preference for the plots, calculated by measuring the number of beans eaten. Doves showed a tendency to avoid plots that had balloons. However, the intensity of avoidance differed between balloons with and without eyespots only in the first experiment, although the differences were not significant. That is, the scaring effectiveness of eyespot patterns is not very strong, and becomes extinct rapidly. These results suggest that the scaring effectiveness of eyespot balloons is mainly due to the curious stimulus of balloons rather than to the eyespot patterns themselves. © 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

AB  - An "eye-spotted" beach ball and a commercially available deterrent eye-spot ball significantly reduced the number of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) visiting a bird table to feed. The commercial ball had a greater deterrent effect than the beach ball at all four distances tested (10, 20, 30, and 40 m). The deterrent effect of both balls decreased with distance from the table, and was neglible at c. 40 m. Deterrence was increased 10% by illuminating the eyes with a rotating halogen light and by reinforcing the visual stimulus with alarm calls of blackbirds (Turdus merula), house sparrows, and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), but declined with continuous use, and disappeared altogether after 9 days. Eye-spot beach balls in a vineyard significantly reduced landings by song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) for 2 weeks, and landings by blackbirds, house sparrows, and starlings for 3 weeks. They failed, however, in the fourth week when the grapes were fully ripe and most in need of protection. Eye-spot balls are environmentally friendly, so could be especially useful bird scarers in organic vineyards and near residential areas. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 1995.

AB  - A severe Ascochyta blight (Ascochyta phaseolorum Sacc.), was found during a survey carried out in farmer's fields of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) at Itatiba county, São Paulo State, Brazil. Foliar lesions were usually circular to irregular shaped, brown to dark brown and usually contained concentric circles of picnidia. These lesions often blighted the entire leaves, that die and fall. The pathogen also infected the stems, petioles and pods, and the disease incidence ranged from trace to severe. The stems and petioles lesions were elongated and cankerous, often girdling them, killing the plant above the infected region. The pod lesions were initially circular and zonate, as the foliar spots, but the concentric circles are of little evidence. Diagnosis were confirmed by isolation, cultural and morphological characteristics of the fungus, besides pathogenicity tests. The disease was confused with Alternaria blight, on the leaves, or Macrophomina rot, on the lower part of stems. The pathogen identification permitted to avoid misidentification and to establish measures of control.

AB  - Using concentric-cylinder, blade-vane, and parallel-plate viscometers, reliable quantitative rheological results (yield stress, apparent viscosity, etc.) of simulated nuclear waste slurry are obtained. Concentric-cylinder and parallel-plate geometries were used to measure shear stress versus shear rate. Precautions required to avoid Taylor vortices and the correction of wall slip were addressed. The blade-vane geometry was used for direct measurement of yield stress and compared with extrapolated values obtained from the concentric-cylinder and parallel-plate measurements. Consistent results were obtained with these different laboratory viscometers. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The author discusses different methods of urban analysis, using the example of Mexico City, Mexico. "In this work two outlines are used: a concentric one that reflects the city's expansion and a segregated one that sees the 'different cities' within. We analyze the commercial occupation of central areas and the growth due to the expansion of the periphery from 1950 to 1986. In both processes, the massive expulsion of the inhabitants appears, firstly as an effect and secondly as a cause. This fact serves as an argument to explore certain proposals in a prospective dimension. In the technical [spatial] analysis we generally avoid the design of the city itself. Here we approach some design ideas without forgetting their social dimension." (SUMMARY IN ENG) excerpt

AB  - The development of active isokinetic dynamometers has allowed the assessment of muscular moment under eccentric activations that have different characteristics to concentric actions. It is well documented that at a given angular velocity the eccentric moment is greater than the corresponding concentric moment. The moment-velocity relationship under eccentric conditions has been investigated, with conflicting results. Particularly, eccentric moment was reported to remain similar to, or to increase or decrease with, increasing angular velocity. As with concentric actions, the reliability of isokinetic eccentric measurements is influenced by a number of factors such as gravity, preload force and testing position. The velocity-specific effects of eccentric training have not been extensively investigated. Based on current knowledge, eccentric exercise does not appear to be velocity-specific. Although the mode specificity of both concentric and eccentric exercises have been investigated, the resultant observations are conflicting. Eccentric training has been found to improve both concentric and eccentric strength; yet, it has also been reported to improve only concentric or eccentric strength. The reciprocal muscle group ratios under eccentric actions were found not to be influenced by angular velocity, but the significant role of the eccentric/concentric moment ratio of each muscle has not been examined thoroughly. It is well documented that eccentric activations are associated with delayed muscle soreness and muscle damage. A limited number of studies have reported that isokinetic eccentric efforts may result in a lower amount of muscle soreness compared with other exercise modalities. Isokinetic dynamometers provide some unique characteristics for rehabilitation applications. Examination of the clinical application of eccentric exercise is limited. Consequently, the use of this exercise modality in prevention and assessment of musculoskeletal injuries should be investigated further. © 1995, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Z8-tetradecenyl acetate (Z8-l4OAc) and Z8-tetradecenyl alcohol (Z8-14OH) were identified as sex pheromone components of the eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae). Compounds were identified by gas chromatographic-etectroantennographic (GC-EAD) and GC-mass spectroscopic analyses and field tested in apple orchards in the Okanagan Valley, B.C. Although Z8-14OAc alone was attractive to male S. ocellana, the addition of 1-5% Z8-140H strongly synergized its attraction. Field tests comparing the attractiveness of virgin female S. ocellana with various doses of a 99:1 blend of Z8-140Ac and Z8-140H indicated the natural sex pheromone has only two significant components. A 99:1 blend of Z8-140Ac and Z8-140H is suggested for monitoring and control of S. ocellana populations in British Columbia. © 1991, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical and microscopic features of wood decay by several ascomycetes in axenic culture are described. The tested ascomycetes caused significant weight losses in birch wood. Daldinia concentrica was especially active, causing a weight loss of 62.9% after 2 months. While lignin and carbohydrates were both degraded, carbohydrates were preferentially attacked. As measured by alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation, syringylpropane units of the lignin were removed selectively. AU of the tested ascomycetes eroded fiber cells walls beginning from the lumen. Some also caused cavities in the secondary walls, typical of soft-rot decay. Pine wood was generally resistant to decay; some of those species which were capable of forming soft-rot cavities in birch caused significant weight loss in pine. Alstonia scholaris, a tropical hardwood with a guaiacyl-rich lignin, was resistant to degradation. © 1989, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract.  1. Microhabitat use and background matching by adult Hipparchia semele (L.) in a coastal sand dune site in south Wales were studied during the flight period of 1986. 2. Microhabitat use by both sexes is related to temperature and activity. When settling substrates are cool, typically during the early morning, most individuals are located on the warmest basking substrate, lichen patches. After a period of warming, males perch to locate mates on exposed areas of sand where there is a large field of view and where they are visually apparent. Egg‐laying females tend to settle on lichen patches throughout the day. 3. Overall, females are maximally visually cryptic when settled on lichen patches with unexposed forewings. Male crypsis on lichen is less effective, but greater on most other substrates, than that of females. It is argued that individuals match lichen patches because this substrate is used when they are most liable to detection and capture by vertebrate predators. Male crypsis is probably a compromise between maximizing protection on lichen patches and requirements for resemblance to other substrates. 4. The underside hindwing phenotype does not match sand. Background matching to this substrate is probably not important because it tends to be used when individuals are active and can effectively use secondary defence mechanisms. 5. It is suggested that the apical eyespot and orange patch on the forewing underside have a dual role in secondary defence, acting as a startling and deflective device, being exposed by disturbed individuals and by those engaged in activities which may disrupt the visual crypsis afforded by the hindwing underside.

AB  - Data and calculation techniques for frictional pressure loss in smooth concentric annuli are reviewed. It is shown that the accepted method of Meter and Bird, and of Rothful, Monrad, and Senecal deviate by 4% and 8% respectively from the correct limit for small gaps. Further, neither correctly predicts the data trends with decreasing radius ratio. In addition the data upon which the Meter and Bird correlation was based, in part, was probabl deficient due to strong secondary flow caused by the unrestricted exit tee. Finally, the method of Jones, previously applied to rectangular ductsl has been extended to smooth, concentric annuli. It is shown that both the trends and the limiting behaviour are quantitatively correct. (A)

AB  - Following a list of the economically most important fungal wheat diseases, recent trends in chemical seed treatment are discussed. Different fungicide mixtures are now available for the replacement of mercurial dressings, but are generally more expensive. The control of fungal diseases by spraying has become more and more common over the past ten years in certain countries. Advantage has been taken of the curative action of the modern systemic chemicals. The major diseases are powdery mildew, rusts, eyespot, glume‐and leaf‐blotch. The general application of a fungicide programme is restricted by regional wheat prices, and should also be limited to reduce environmental contamination. Knowledge about economic thresholds and correct timing of control are indispensable, and in special cases the development of warning systems is advisable. The role of Cycocel (chlormequat) is also discussed. A danger of fungicide resistance in populations of plant pathogenic fungi has arisen with the introduction of the systemic fungicides (one‐site‐inhibitors). As yet, however, no economically important case of fungicide resistance within cereal pathogens is known. Factors favouring the stepwise selection of resistant strains under field conditions are discussed in detail, and experimental data are presented on this subject. Other positive or negative side‐effects of the modern fungicides are described. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Undercuts in injection molds often require, for completely automatic demolding, slides, which function by stages and are concentrically arranged. To avoid this complexity, handling equipment can be employed that assumes partial functions of the demolding, thus avoiding the disadvantage of manual demolding. This is illustrated using the example of a case for an exterior rear-view mirror of a motor car. For figures see German text.

AB  - Beginning in the early 1960s, copper neutral wires wound around some electric distribution cables were found corroding away even within the first 5 years of their planned 30-year life. Semiconducting thermoplastic materials for jacketing such concentric neutral (CN) cables were found effective in preventing corrosion. One cause for this type of corrosion is thought to be the relative scarcity of iron objects in the surrounding soil which in years past used to provide automatic cathodic protection. Other, more immediate causes were discovered by experiments, such as coarse backfills and lead-tin-alloy coatings applied to CN wires.

AB  - Previous studies that have looked at the aversive properties of simple, predator‐related, eye‐like patterns presented in an artificial context, have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate whether such stimuli had potential for use as bird scarers. The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species. The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area. Each subject was deprived of food for 5 h and then tested in an apparatus which exposed an eye pattern over a food trough immediately after the bird alighted on that trough. 10 measures of the starlings' feeding behaviour were monitored over a 1‐h trial. It was predicted that five of these variables would be positively and five negatively correlated with an increase in the fear evoking properties of the stimulus. The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be an ‘aversiveness index’. The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects. The main findings from the eight experiments are as follows. Simple eye‐like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity. The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused an 88% reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65% reduction in actual feeding time. The presence of ‘pupils’ in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversive than the control card. Once a pattern has the ‘pupil/iris’ distinction then a circular outline becomes important although the shape of the ‘pupil’ appears relatively unimportant. Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the ‘pupil’ and ‘iris’ appears irrelevant. Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed if the same stimuli are presented within the context of a simple head outline. Changing the orientation of a pair of eyes from horizontal to vertical only slightly reduces their aversiveness. The size of the patterns appears to be unimportant within the range tested. The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive. The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl. 1983 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Changes in wing pattern, colour, shape and size associated with seasonal polyphenism in Melanitis leda were quantified using a series of 155 butterflies collected by N. Manders on Mauritius in 1905. Butterflies of the wetter period were predominantly of the wet season form with large, well differentiated eyespots, short tails, smaller wings and a characteristic background colour. The dry season form occurred only in the drier period and has much smaller eyespots, longer tails, larger wings and a variable background. Many intermediates occurred, mainly in the drier period. These are associated with an absence of extreme seasonal change in Mauritius. The first principal component (PCI) describing the morphometric and colour data is closely related to the wing form (r = 0.80). Regression analyses using temperature and rainfall data for the 8 weeks before each capture showed that about 40% of variation in PCI could be accounted for by temperature in weeks 2–3 before capture. Many of the characters measured are redundant; a subset of seven morphometric characters yields a closely similar PCI. Analysis of is subset in an additional sample of 70 M. leda from Kenya showed that the seasonal polyphenism overrides a small degree of sexual dimorphism. The results are discussed with regard to seasonal changes in adult activity, resting backgrounds and visual predation. Wing phenotype characters are part of an array of coordinated morphological and life history traits which include ovarian dormancy and fat body development in dry season adults. A partial independence occurs in the proximal control of these traits as indicated, for example, by the larger wing and tail size, and smaller eyespots of the small number of the wet season form captured in the drier period in comparison to those of the wetter months.

AB  - Marine biofouling becomes a major problem in cooling systems such as condensers in power plants when seawater is employed as a coolant. The result of the marine biofouling build-up is a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient of the unit and increased pressure drop. This investigation consisted of developing and evaluating a method to prevent the effects of marine biofouling in heat exchangers of the shell-and-tube type. An experimental shell-and-tube apparatus of three double-pipe heat exchangers (made of concentric titanium tubes) was designed to allow investigation of parameters that influence heat transfer rate and biofouling growth. The study was focused on the application of the technique known as anodically polarized protection on surfaces of tubular heat exchangers that employ seawater as a coolant.

AB  - Subpial astrocytic processes were examined in developing rats, mainly with complementary replicas, to see how orthogonal arrays of particles (OAs) are formed and become numerous in membranes covered by basal lamina. Only a few (4.2%) endfeet in the membranes contacting the basal lamina (subpial membranes) had acquired OAs by the 19-day foetal stage. The number of endfeet provided with OAs increased drastically in the prenatal period, continued to increase at birth (P0), and somewhat more slowly in the early postnatal period (P0-P3), reaching 100% at P10. There were neuronal processes as well abutting on the basal lamina at the pial surface but they were easy to distinguish from astrocytic endfeet because of their larger intramembrane particles (IMPs), which are sparsely distributed and in patch-like aggregations. The distribution density of OAs in differentiated astrocytic endfeet also increased very gradually with age until P0, a little faster in the early postnatal period, and drastically from P10 to adult. Ordinary globular IMPs increased in number with age and continued to increase in the lateral membrane where OAs were still very few, though less rapidly in the subpial membrane as OAs became numerous. With maturation, larger IMPs became conspicuous in the lateral membrane but not in the subpial, suggesting that larger IMPs were predominantly used to form OAS. We have proposed the idea that relatively large IMPs line up to form single linear arrays (SLs), appearing as grooves on the E face, and that occasionally some SLs line up in multiple rows multiple linear arrays (MLs)] and that SLs or MLs fuse with one another to become rod-like strands, then divide into squares to become OAS. SLs and MLs appeared ontogenetically earlier than OAs, and continued to appear in membranes provided with OAS. In areas where membranes were bent, transition of these three structures was observable and the proportion of OAs increased with age. Further, in such areas, alignment of OAs was different according to membrane curvature: concentric in and around protrusions, perpendicular to the edge of invaginations. This unique association of OA alignment with membrane curvature suggests that OAs contribute to some membrane stability in the area covered by the basal lamina and provide the membrane with special resistance to bending. © 1989 Chapman and Hall Ltd.

AB  - Conspicuous faults in the New Red Sandstone (NRS, mainly Permian-Triassic) of Arran are shown to be kinematically related to the intrusion of the Northern Granite in Paleocene time. Early inflation of the granite pluton in the upper crust induced radial stretching in the overlying sedimentary cover, recorded in predominantly normal offsets on the faults in the NRS. Continued ballooning of the pluton superimposed strong concentric dip-slip displacement over its flanks. Previous assessments of the ballooning process in general have been made on deep-level lateral margins of plutons where radial shortening dominates in the envelope. North Arran is an important example of the complexities of ballooning at shallow levels in a heterogeneous crust.-from Author

AB  - Chinese historical records of about 2,000 years ago noted several unique epidemiological features and possible risk factors of esophageal cancer in this country. This paper presents selected recent findings on the epidemiology of esophageal cancer in China with special attention directed to geographical distribution, risk factors, and preventive measures. Some of the major characteristics of this disease in China include: 1) an unusually high mortality, the highest in the world; 2) wide geographical differences in mortality; 3) an irregular concentric belt area of elevated mortality; 4) stability of rates over the years; 5) variations in rate by sex; 6) great ethnic differences in mortality; 7) gullet cancer in chickens comparable to the human disease; and 8) association with high prevalence of epithelial dysplasia of the esophagus. It has been hypothesized that the prevalence of esophageal cancer in high-risk areas may be associated with fermented and moldy foodstuffs, nitrosamines, deficiencies of molybdenum, nutritional deficiencies, specific living habits, and poor oral hygiene. Accordingly, comprehensive studies are being conducted in Lin County and other areas with elevated risk of this disease so that the possible function of fungi and nitrosamines in the carcinogenesis of esophageal cancer can be determined.

AB  - Single neurons recorded from the owl's visual Wulst are surprisingly similar to those found in mammalian striate cortex. The receptive fields of Wulst neurons are elaborated, in an apparently hierarchical fashion, from those of their monocular, concentrically organized inputs to produce binocular interneurons with increasingly sophisticated requirements for stimulus orientation, movement and binocular disparity. Output neurons located in the superficial laminae of the Wulst are the most sophisticated of all, with absolute requirements for a combination of stimuli, which include binocular presentation at a particular horizontal binocular disparity, and with no response unless all of the stimulus conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Such neurons have the properties required for 'global stereopsis,' including a receptive field size many times larger than their optimal stimulus, which is more closely matched to the receptive fields of the simpler, disparity-selective interneurons. These marked similarities in functional organization between the avian and mammalian systems exist in spite of a number of structural differences which reflect their separate evolutionary origins. Discussion therefore includes the possibility that there may exist for nervous systems only a very small number of possible solutions, perhaps a unique one, to the problem of stereopsis.

AB  - The cement industry uses three basic types of drives for grinding mills: the large right-angle gear drives, parallel shaft concentric gear drives, and the ring gear and pinion with primary reducers for raw grinding. The latter two types are also used for finish grinding. Each type of drive must have special maintenance considerations. Anticipating a failure or a scheduled downtime for parts replacement is far better than operating from emergency breakdown to emergency breakdown. Included are examples of failures that have occurred on all three of the drives and couplings indicated. Specific steps for preventive maintenance on each type of drive are included.

AB  - A navigational system with a timing control function has been developed and put into practical use as a driver-assistance system for pleasant drives. This system concentrically controls the timing of a washer-coupled wiper, intermittent wiper, fading room lamp and so on, whose controllers are microcomputer-based. Using the same microcomputer, this system can indicate such driving information as fuel consumption, average fuel economy, average speed, trip meter, fuel gauge and time. The concentration of timing controllers makes possible a light weight, miniaturized and simplified wiring harness, and the unification of the timing control function and navigation function makes possible high cost-performance and accurate indication of driving information. This system features accurate fuel computation from driving pulses of fuel injectors without an expensive fuel flow sensor and easy operation to obtain various driving information and warnings.

AB  - A white light laser has been constructed which employs a concentric cylinder type laser tube and embodies the novel concept of separating the functions of confining the negative glow providing for diffusion of Cd vapor, The main source preventing the white light oscillation in previous designs is not a tack of Cd vapor in lasing zone but a decrease of the hollow-cathode effect due to many holes of large diameter. © 1980 IEEE

AB  - In spite of the increasing use of silicon in applications where mechanical stresses are deliberately applied to the material, such as in transducers, and the fatal nature of cracking in silicon devices, there is very limited characterisation and understanding of the fracture behaviour of silicon wafers at room temperature. This understanding is of increasing importance with the use of larger diameter wafers in modern technology. This paper examines the fracture strength of a wide range of silicon material both as-grown and after processing. The wafers tested were from crystals grwon by float-zone and Czochralski techniques and the effects of oxidation, ion-implantation and annealing in various environments have been studied. The technique used to measure the fracture stress involved simply supporting the wafer on an aluminium ring concentric to the load axis. The load was gradually increased until the wafer fractured. This method was chosen to avoid edge effects, and has proved to have adequate reproducibility. Typical values of the fracture stress obtained by this method, for different crystals, vary between 2 and 3.5 GPa. In the first part of the study, the role of the surface on the fracture behaviour has been investigated in detail. While the surface perfection of the tensile surface has a major effect on the fracture stress (as shown in previous studies), some of the results were found to be sensitive to the compressive surface as well. In the case where the results are sensitive to the compressive surface finish the fracture stress rose from 3.7 to 8.8 GPa as the surface finish was improved while in the cases where they were not sensitive the fracture stress remained at about 3.5-4.6 GPa. Only in the float-zone material were fracture stresses approaching 8.8 GPa observed. At this level of fracture stress, the behaviour is believed to be sensitive to surface defects less than 0.01 μm in size. These results can be analyzed in terms of surface controlled defects under conditions where surface defects are dominant and bulk controlled defects where these defects are dominant. In this manner bulk effects can be isolated from surface ones. This gives the opportunity to study the effects of specific defects on the fracture stress and the results in this paper are discussed in terms of the role of surface and internal defects on the fracture stress. © 1987.

AB  - The Warner & Swasey Co, Cleveland, OH, has devised a method of turning shafts with up to 12:1 length-to-diameter ratios on their 2-axis, column-type NC turning machines - without using steady rests. This technique is an adaptation of a similar one the company used years ago on its turret lathes. With this procedure, up to half of the part is inserted into the spindle and held with a special adjustable backstop. Since only part of the shaft extends from the spindle, diameter-to-length ratios are proportionately reduced and part deflection is minimized. Normally, this setup has the ability to hold concentricities to at least 0. 005 double prime tir on most shafts, which is well within the range of accepted turning and grinding practice. In addition, this method permits the user to take heavy roughing cuts and turn at high speeds and feed rates to 0. 035 ipr. Even with two chuckings, Warner & Swasey's procedure has resulted in many parts being turned faster than with other methods. At the same time it avoids the drawbacks and extra costs of steady rests.

AB  - We have developed a new chemical vapour deposition system using a cavity type microwave discharge method to avoid the damage caused by plasma bombardment. The deposition region containing the substrate is separated from the discharge region by using a coaxial line type microwave CW discharge tube that can confine the discharge plasma in a predetermined region. Ar gas is fed into the outer tube of a coaxial double quartz tube and Ar gas plasma is created by microwave power. By the inner tube, SiH4 gas is concentrically introduced into the Ar gas plasma through the discharge tube, without a silicon deposition on the quartz tube wall. SiH4 gas is dissociated and flows into deposition region. Then, Si thin films are fabricated on the substrate out of the discharge plasma. The deposition rate is several to tens Å/s. Very uniform Si thin films are fabricated over a circle with a 10 cm diameter while keeping the substrate at about 10 cm from the discharge tube end. The structure of the films is amorphous. The optical band gap is 1.8 to 2.4 eV. © 1983, The Vacuum Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to saturation, supplementary currents may be induced in the stator windings of single phase induction motors, causing excessive heating of these windings. These currents will flow into the supply, generating an harmonic distortion of its current. In order to avoid these currents, a winding scheme may be used which will not have voltages induced by the saturation field. It should be taken into account that due to price reasons only concentric windings are to be used in such designs.

AB  - Abstract:  An experiment was conducted on 150 subjects; 100 schizophrenic and 50 control subjects. Each subject was given 56 or 57 word‐cards, which consisted of 5 Cards sebes (I, me, myself, etc.), 4 or 6 Cards families (father, mother, etc.), 7 Cards bodies (head, eyes, etc.), 11 Cards detestable (snake, etc.) and others. These cards were to be distributed in three concentric circles according to the standard of importance for the subjects. The results for the schizophrenic group in comparison with those for the control group were: (1) Fewer cards were distributed in the central circle. (2) The number of the distributed Cards important was smaller for the central and larger for the outward circle, etc. The discussion on the results was carried out with regard to the inner structure of ego, the boundary between ego and the outer world and the flexibility of ego. The conclusion of the discussion is as follows: In schizophrenics, (1) The boundaries among the inner region of ego diminish. (2) The boundary between ego and the outer world diminishes. (3) Ego loses its flexibility. (4) Ego contracts. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Tubing conveyed techniques have been successfully applied in through-tubing remedial operations where excessive hole deviation and/or helical buckling have prevented conventional wireline or electric line operations. Perforating and setting bridge plugs have been performed using a concentric work string and a pressure actuated firing head. Two case histories, in which remaining reserves would not support the cost of a conventional rig workover, are presented. These cases describe procedures which were used successfully in remedial operations. Copyright 1987, Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - The ovules of Retzia capensis are anatropous, unitegmic and tenuinucellate. A well‐developed hypostase of concentric layers of cells is present. Embryo sac formation follows Polygonum type. The central part of the mature embryo sac contains rich amounts of starch grains, which disappear at the beginning of the endosperm development. The endosperm formation results in a chalazal haustorium of a great number of long, narrow, densely plasmatic cells, a micropylar haustorium of loosely plasmatic cells, and a middle region which in the beginning is only partly cellular, but later the whole endosperm consists of long, narrow cells. The hypostase prevents the chalazal endosperm haustorium from penetrating to the lower part of the ovule, while the micropylar haustorium is able to grow upwards into the long micropyle. The cellular endosperm formation, the formation of endosperm haustoria, of which the micropylar is most distinctive, and formation of a well‐developed hypostase all indicate a close relationship to Buddleiaceae and part of Scrophulariaceae. Therefore, both Retziaceae and Buddleiaceae should be placed in the order Scrophulariales. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The cellular alterations induced in sugarbeet by Heterodera schachtii were studied at 3 and 12 days after nematode inoculation. Three days after inoculation the procambial cells involved in the nematode feeding were already transformed into a syncytium with ultrastructural features which indicated high metabolic activity. Feeding tubes produced by interaction of nematode saliva with the cell contents were observed; in their vicinity the cytoplasm was devoid of cell organelles except for smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Spiny structures occurred in the parenchyma syncytial cells and they appeared to be related to endoplasmic reticulum and dictyosomes; the relation could be functional and it is possible that the spiny component is involved in protein synthesis. Nuclei were enlarged and amoeboid in form and sometimes they migrated through a space in the cell wall. Conspicuous elements of rough endoplasmic reticulum, arranged in concentric layers and actively synthesizing, and plastids with dense inclusions indicating bulk protein synthesis, were detected in parenchyma cells, adjacent to syncytia. Twelve days after nematode inoculation the ground cytoplasm of the syncytia was densely packed, but without vacuoles and the membrane system resembled endoplasmic reticulum. At this time the modification of the cytoplasm and cell wall appeared to be involved in the rapid solute uptake which would be essential for nematode development. © 1987.

Jerky motion, wing flicking behavior, and sudden short flights to nearby foliage enhance this resemblance. In the laboratory, sympatric jumping spiders (Salticidae) attacked and captured more house flies Musca domestica or wing-painted Z. vittigera (wing markings disguised by green paint) than unpainted Z. vittigera.

AB  - A solder mask is a permanent coating applied to a printed wiring board (pwb) after the conductors have been formed, but prior to the assembly operations of component insertion and attachment. Its purpose is to prevent molten solder from bridging conductors and pads during assembly soldering processes, and subsequently to provide a protective barrier against surface contamination during the circuit's operating life. The problem faced by the printed circuit industry is that of applying a solder mask coating to a pwb by a method that is less costly, yet achieves or surpasses the resolution and registration provided by photoprinting. A patented process has been developed to apply the solder mask in a manner that produces uncoated annular areas, concentric to, and surrounding each lead hole. Definition and registration of these areas-are accomplished without the use of a conventional patterning tool, i. e. , screen or photomask.

AB  - Due to the project SNQ an experiment for the water cooling system was built, where the pH range, the H SUB 2 and O SUB 2 concentration are supervised and the temperature is constant. The specimens should be investigated due to oxide growth and crevice corrosion attack. The specimens which have been exposed to different experimental conditions, show oxide growth, depending on the velocity of the coolant. Oxide crystals grow compactly on a homogeneous base where the velocity of the coolant is low. This could be determined on the crevice corrosion specimens. At several positions crevice corrosion attack up to 100 MUm could be observed by optical metallography. The mechanical and chemical methods show no special results. After separation of the oxide layer no weight loss could be observed compared to the reference specimens. The surface roughness before and after the experiment are the same. Concentricity measurements show only differences in terms of MUm, the range of the manufacturing tolerance. (English abstract)

AB  - Ocelli on the dorsal plumage of Polyplectron malacense (Aves: Phasianidae) are arranged round the real eye only during displays to females, not to other males; those nearest the eye are the better mimics. Ways in which the ocelli resemble the real eye include colour, convexity, iridescence, roundness and concentricity; they also 'track' the female as the male shifts position. In this genus there has been concomitant radiation of iris and ocellus colour. The general importance of the eye in galliform displays is discussed. © 1983.

AB  - Sodium-cooled reactor vessels must not resist high pressures, and their walls are relatively thin. These vessels are usually suspended by their lateral wall to the cold roof slab. The upper part of this wall is subjected to periodic thermal stresses and to a permanent tension, corresponding to the weight of the sodium and of the components inside the vessel. In order to avoid a progressive deformation, the temperature of the vessel wall is limited to approximately 400 degree C. This necessitates setting up relatively expensive baffles to isolate the wall from the hot sodium flowing out of the core. In order to relieve the wall from weight-related stresses, vessels resting on the installation basemat by means of sliding or articulated supports were proposed in early projects. A current design proposal consists of resting the vessel bottom on welded, concentric skirts, the chosen temperature of the bottom being relatively low; then a stable thermal gradient appears in sodium layers below the core. The corresponding heat flux lost toward the bottom proves remarkably low; an important simplification of the vessel walls and internal structures, as well as interesting safety features, may be obtained.

AB  - Axisymmetric unsteady oscillations of a thin elastic circular homogeneous plate of constant thickness are considered. The plate rests on an internal concentric support circle. This support does not prevent possible detachment of the plate from it when a uniformly distributed load is suddenly applied to it. Equations of motion of the plate, taking account of the inertia of rotation and shear, are employed. The problem is solved numerically employing a specially modified method of grids. Curves of plate characteristics are plotted.

AB  - GPA1734, an inhibitor of BM collagen biosynthesis, was investigated in the CAM model system for its effect on angiogenesis. Evaluation of angiogenesis was performed by placing a thin plastic coverslip inscribed with concentric circles on the CAM and counting the number of vessels intercepting the circles. The rate of BM collagen biosynthesis was monitored using [U-14C] proline incorporation into CAM proteins and determining the collagenase-digestible protein fraction. A marked depression in the vascular density was observed in the CAM area under a plastic disc containing GPA1734 as compared to control discs placed on the CAM about 1 cm apart from days 9 to 12 of incubation. A concomitant decrease in collagenous protein biosynthesis was observed in the area under the discs containing GPA1734 and [U-14C]proline as compared to control discs containing only the radiolabeled proline. The forementioned effects of GPA1734 on CAM were specific because no similar effects were observed with a closely related compound, 9,10-dihydroxy-7-methyl-benzo[b]quinolizinium bromide or with GPA1734 plus Fe++, which did not affect the rate of BM collagen biosynthesis. These results suggest that inhibitors of BM collagen biosynthesis prevent angiogenesis by interfering with the formation of an essential component of the vessel wall. The search for such inhibitors may be a new approach in the development of antiangiogenic agents.

AB  - A simple method is presented for modeling perforated muffler components such as concentric resonators with perforated flow tube, and expansion chambers and reverse flow chambers with perforated inlet and outlet tubes. The theory includes mean flow, but is confined to those configurations having one acoustically long dimension. It is based on a segmentation procedure in which each segment is described by a transmission matrix. The four-pole parameters of a component are then found from the product of the transmission matrices. The four-pole parameters for configurations having through flow, cross flow, and reverse flow are presented. Because the product matrices are dimensionally small and because no inversion is needed, computational time is much lower than other methods such as finite element or finite difference. This allows rapid and economical modeling to be performed where iterative solutions are required because of dominating finite amplitude effects, for example. © 1979, American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Dissociated ciliary ganglionic neurons do not survive in culture unless supplied with an appropriate source of ciliary neuronotrophic factors (CNTF). Moreover, previous work from this and other laboratories has shown that polyornithine (PORN) substrata per se do not allow neuritic development from such CNTF-supported neurons. Neuritic formation, however, would take place if the PORN substratum is coated with a neurite-promoting factor (NPF) from heart conditioned medium. Undissociated chick embryo ciliary ganglia explanted on PORN substrata will also produce a lavish radial neuritic outgrowth only if they are CNTF supported and the substratum is coated with NPF. In the absence of exogenous NPF neurites grow radially but only to a limited extent. At a distance of approximately 120 μm from the explant, neurites switch from a radial to a circular or tangential growth pattern, thus giving rise to a neuritic ring almost concentric with respect to the explant. Time-lapse studies show that the neuritic ring is generated through a combination of several behaviors that neurites display upon reaching the radial-to-circular "transition zone," including branching and turning either clock- or counterclockwise. Contributions are also made by interneuritic bridges arising from fusion of tangential filopodia from adjacent growth cones. The overall behavior of neuritic outgrowth suggests that the explanted ciliary ganglia are able to produce materials endowed with neurite-promoting properties, which coat the PORN substratum in the immediate vicinity of the ganglia. Autoradiographic experiments using ganglia prelabeled with either [3H]glucosamine or [14C]leucine demonstrated the existence of these materials. A periganglionic territory of PORN-attached materials (PAMs) of ganglionic origin can be recognized a few hours after explantation, before the onset of neuritic emergence from the ganglion. This PAM territory grossly corresponds to the area that a few hours later will be occupied by the neuritic ring. If two ganglia are explanted at a distance approximately equal to twice the distance normally covered by a dense periganglionic PAM halo, a continuity between the PAM territories of both ganglia is established before the onset of neuritic outgrowth. This overlapping generates an "avenue of preferential terrain" that provides guidance to neurites between the neighboring ganglia. The possibility is considered that a similar mechanism of neuritic guidance could also occur in vivo. © 1981.

AB  - An epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody I‐5G9 was expressed by all neural crest cells shortly after explantation into culture. At this time all neural crest cells actively migrated away from the neural tube. Immunoreactivity was localized intracellularly and organized into stress fiber‐like filaments. Often, immunofluorescence was particularly high in short fibers in the lamellipodia of the reading edge of migrating cells. Two‐week‐old cultures had a diameter of 8–10 mm. At that stage a ring of immunoreactive cells was present at the periphery of each culture, an area where cells were still migratory. An inner concentric circle had reduced and more granular staining. In this area cells had ceased to migrate. In the center of the culture cells were multilayered, nonmigratory, and did not bind I‐5G9. After creating a lesion in the nonreactive central region, some cells resumed migration into the lesioned area and reexpressed the epitope. I‐5G9 staining and phalloidin fluorescence colocalized partially in some cells and completely in others. It is concluded that the epitope recognized by I‐5G9 is expressed in a migration‐dependent manner. The partial colocalization of I‐5G9 and phalloidin fluorescence supports the notion that the epitope recognized by I‐5G9 is specifically expressed in stress fibers of migratory cells, possibly in one of the actin‐associated proteins or an F actin‐associated protein complex.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that eye-shapes are aversive to the domestic chick but controversy remains over the relative importance of various features of the eyes in causing aversion. In this study the potency of various eye-like shapes in causing avoidance was evaluated. It was shown that monochromatic, two-dimensional eye shapes elicit avoidance and fear in young male domestic chicks, and that the eye shapes are not responded to merely as conspicuous objects. Horizontal orientation, pairedness and the presence of both an 'iris' and a 'pupil' are important recognition cues. The shape of the eye-like stimulus appears to be more important than its size. Circularity of the iris is not an essential feature but further work is necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding the shape of the pupil although the available evidence does suggest that circularity is important. © 1980.

AB  - Skiing requires aerobic fitness. For aerobic conditioning, there must be significant elevation in heart rate during training. Although anaerobic training benefits physical fitness in general, skiing requires more aerobic than anaerobic conditioning. Strength, power, and endurance can be maintained through the use of concentric and eccentric contractions, using a variety of equipment and sports. Care should be taken to avoid injury to the patellofemoral joint during training. It is important to use specificity in choosing sports, as well as the exercise patterns in preseason training. If these principles are recognized in ski conditioning, a successful and effective training program will result.

AB  - The formation of the wing pigmentation patterns of three species of butterflies has been modelled using a mechanism based on a tripod of assumptions. First, that there may be morphogen sources in the foci of eyespots and morphogen sinks at some parts of the wing margin, all other cells being passive. Second, that the morphogen has a finite half life and diffuses simply and freely away from the sources throughout a wing of hexagonally packed cells. Third, that the overt pattern derives from cells interpreting the local morphogen concentration with respect to thresholds which determine scale colours. The final pattern thus follows lines of constant morphogen concentration and may, depending on the distribution of sources, comprise rings, curves or bands. With such a model, we have been able to compute stable patterns having the essential topology of the compound spots of Tenaris domitilla, the large rings of Diaethria marchalii and the pattern of eyespots, rings and asymmetric bands of Ragadia minoa. Quantitative analysis of the pattern-forming process shows that, with a biologically realistic diffusion constant (~ 5.10-7 cm2 sec-1) and a morphogen half life less than 6 h, the patterns form within ~ 12 h over a wing of ~ 1000 cells in length. The limitations of the model are that the exact morphology of the eyespots and bands do not match precisely those of the original wings, that there are edge distortions and that optimal patterns may be critically dependent on the exact positions of sources and sinks. An explanation for part of the discrepancy is that we have assumed an adult wing shape and foci coordinates in modelling a process that took place earlier in development. Nevertheless, the limitations of the model argue against a mechanism based on a single morphogen operating in vivo. However, as the model can generate many features of butterfly wing patterns, it may be considered as a degenerate case of that mechanism.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that thromboxane A2 and thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor ocupation are important in mediating cyclical reductions in coronary blood flow (CFVs) in concentrically narrowed canine coronary arteries. Two potent and selective thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonists, SQ29,548 and SQ28,668 eliminated CFVs and restored a normal pattern of blood flow through the severely narrowed vessels in 77 and 75% of the dogs, respectively. CFVs were eliminated within several minutes of an intravenous bolus injection of SQ29,548 or SQ28,668. A continuous infusion of SQ29,548 (0.2 mg/kg·min) prevented the recurrence of CFVs throughout the duration of its infusion. Left atrial infusion of the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619, restored CFVs in 5 of 8 SQ29,548-treated and in 5 of 7 SQ28,668-treated dogs. Circulating concentrations of the stable metabolites of TxA2 and PGI2, TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF(1α), respectively, were unaffected by administration of SQ29,548. However, stenosed vascular segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of SQ29,548-treated dogs produced significantly less thromboxane A2 than comparable segments from untreated dogs. Morphologic studies showed that stenosed coronary arteries in which CFVs has been abolished by either SQ29,548 or SQ28,668 had relatively few adherent platelets, whereas comparable coronary segments removed from untreated animals had relatively large, platelet-rich mural thrombi. SQ29,548 did not alter the synthesis of TxB2 by platelets. 6-keto-PGF(1α) concentrations in the stenosed LAD and nonstenosed circumflex coronary arteries were not altered by SQ29,548 administration. These data suggest that the thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonists, SQ29,548 and SQ28,668, inhibit cyclic reductions in coronary blood flow in this model by preventing the accumulation of platelets at the site of a critical coronary arterial stenosis. The data also suggest that TxA2 is important in mediating the interaction between platelets and the constructed coronary artery that is responsible for the development and maintenance of CFVs in this experimental model.

AB  - Experiments were carried out to assess the increase in yield potential of winter wheat in the U.K. due to variety improvement since the early years of this century. The effects of other genetic changes were minimized by applying fungicide to control eyespot and foliar diseases, and by using nets to prevent lodging. The experiments were carried out in 1978 at Cambridge. One, on soil of high fertility in Camp Field, received 104kgN/ha and the other, on soil of lower fertility in Paternoster Field, received 38kgN/ha. Twelve genotypes were tested. Eight were varieties which formed a chronological series beginning with Little Joss, introduced in 1908. The remaining genotypes were recently developed selections from the Plant Breeding Institute and a line bred by the French breeders, Benoist. The average yield of the 12 varieties and lines tested was 3.96 t/ha in Paternoster Field and 6.40 t/ha in Camp Field. In both fields the two highest yielding entries, Hobbit and the advanced breeding line 989/10, outyielded Little Joss by close to 40 %. Benoist 10483 was the only entry for which the percentage yield advantage depended on high soil fertility. The newer, high yielding, varieties were shorter and reached anthesis earlier than the older varieties. They had lower stem weights/m2 than the older varieties but similar maximum leaf area indices and leaf weights/m2. Within each experiment the total dry-matter production of the varieties was similar, the increase in grain yield due to variety improvement being associated mainly with greater harvest index (ratio of grain yield to grain + straw yield). It is argued that by a continuation of the trend towards reduced stem length, with no change in above-ground biomass, breeders may be able to increase harvest index, from the present value of about 50% to about 60%, achieving a genetic gain in yield of some 25%. As the limit to harvest index is approached, genetic gain in yield will depend on detecting and exploiting genetic variation in biomass production. © 1980, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Skeletal deformities of the denervated hand are subtle in their development and pose a more formidable problem than do primary deformities of Hansen's disease. Basic osseous changes consist of concentric, longitudinal, or the longitudinal varying methods of absorption. Knowledge of their pathogenesis provides the basis for their management. Prevention of deformity and conservative management of secondary complications are necessary to salvage as much of the hand as possible. © 1979, American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

AB  - The 'Bergbau-Forschung' institute, in collaboration with the firm of Wirth & Co., has started tests on rock cutting with high pressure water jets in a sandstone quarry near Dortmund-Hohensyburg. The jets of water emerging from the nozzles of 0.25 mm diameter, at a maximum pressure of 4000 bar, make concentric cuts, that is, free surfaces in the rock. The ridges remaining between these cuts are chiselled off by the discs which follow after. Because of the modified manner of attack on the rock, it is possible to greatly reduce the considerable forces required for heading by the normal drilling process and which can be applied only by very powerful and heavy cutting machines. It is hoped by this method to be able to reduce the dimensions and weight of the traditional types of rock cutting machines. The aim of the project is the development of lightweight and more mobile mining machines with which it may be possible to excavate shorter lengths of roadway economically.

AB  - The role of nerve conduction was studied in acute experimental uveitis caused by antidromic trigeminal nerve stimulation, prostaglandin E1 and E2 (PGE1 and PGE2), capsaicin and substance P (SP). Systemic indomethacin was used to prevent formation of endogenous prostaglandins, and intracameral injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) was used to block nerve conduction. 10μg TTX prevented the miosis and reduced the rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) usually caused by antidromic trigeminal nerve stimulation. At a low dose of PGE1 the IOP rise was blocked by TTX. At higher doses of PGE1 and PGE2 the pressure effect was not blocked by TTX; the miotic effect was markedly diminished. Capsaicin caused a rise in IOP that was almost totally blocked by TTX, while the miosis at high doses seemed unaffected. At low doses, capsaicin‐induced miosis could be abolished by TTX. SP caused miosis in TTX treated eyes similar to that in untreated eyes; the IOP rise was delayed by TTX. The results indicate that nerve conduction plays a role in the IOP reaction caused by low doses of PGE1 and by capsaicin and SP. The mechanism suggested is an axon reflex, elicited in the anterior uvea and resulting in transmitter release in the ciliary processes. Nerve conduction with release of SP or a similar substance in the iris seems to be required for the miotic effects of PGE1 and PGE2. SP and capsaicin are similar in not requiring nerve conduction to cause miosis, but the capsaicin effect probably requires presence of nerves, since denervated eyes—which respond to SP—have been reported not to respond to capsaicin doses similar to those used here. © 1981 Scandinavian Physiological Society

AB  - Trimusculotrema warnaki gen. Et sp. Nov. Is described from the skin of Himantura uarank Forsskal. Trimusculotrema is distinguished from other genera in the Benedeniinae by the following combination of anatomical features: Accessory sclerites and anterior hamuli small; haptor with two or three intrinsic, concentric muscle bands; haptor papillate ventrally; cirrus sac with internal seminal vesicle and spermatophore matrix reservoir; separate male and female pores opening ventrally and dorsally respectively; vagina short. On the basis of these features Benedenia micracantha Euzet and Maillard, 1967 from the skin and B. Leucanthemum Euzet and Maillard, 1967 from the gills of Dasyatis marmorata Steindachner off Senegal are transferred to the new genus as Trimusculotrema micracantha comb, nov. And T. Leucanthemum comb. Nov. The presence of haptoral papillae, noted previously in some species of Entobdella, perhaps indicates that the new genus is more closely related to entobdellids than to benedeniids. Several living specimens of T. Uarnaki had 7 (2-17) eggs in early cleavage projecting from the body, their appendages gripped in a muscular sphincter at the uterine opening. These egg bundles appear to be shed from the parasite soon after laying. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bamboo pulp fibers respond to beating more rapidly than do wood fibers. This is probably due to the difference in secondary wall structure between the fibers. In the present paper, the behavior on beating of pulp fibers from Bambusa polymorpha Munro was investigated from a morphological point of view. The secondary wall of bamboo fibers consists of alternately arranged broad and narrow layers. During the beating process, a number of transverse and concentric cracks are generated in the broad layers, which causes an internal fibrillation. The outer broad layers with their numerous cracks separate from the inner layers and swell highly toward the outside. The outer secondary wall layer of bamboo fibers has a microfibril angle of about 20° with respect to the fiber axis which is much smaller than that of the S1 layer of wood fibers. As a result this layer appears to offer little resistance to prevent the external swelling of the broad layers. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Phototactic responses in a giant amoeboid cell of Physarum plasmodium were studied both by analyzing intracellular ATP content and by applying image processing for recording oscillatory changes in thickness with use of a microcomputer. The ATP content fluctuated and deviated from the initial level upon exposure to light with varying wavelength from 400 to 600 nm. The maximum decrease in the integrated value {Mathematical expression} dt with T=9 minutes occurred at the wavelength 450 nm. The ATP in a migrating plasmodium distributed twice as high in the front as in the rear. This polar pattern became unstable, and a new wavy pattern appeared by stimulating a local frontal part with blue light. In a concentrically extending plasmodium, peripheral and inside regions oscillated in opposite phase to each other. When part of this organism was exposed to light, stimulated and unslimulated regions began to oscillate in opposite phase, and phase waves propagated inward the stimulated region. And the protoplasm there became thinner, the strongest avoidance reaction occurring to 450 nm light as in ATP response. Phototactic behavior in Physarum is discussed in terms of bifurcation in spatio-temporal organization appearing in a self-organizing system. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The position of the oocyte nucleus within the ooplasm is fixed during the mid and late stages of house fly oogenesis. The germinal vesicle is located near the border of the nurse chamber, towards the periphery of the oocyte. The position of the anlage of the chorion raphe is strictly related to the germinal vesicle. As the raphe corresponds to the dorsal side of the later embryo, both the position of the oocyte nucleus and the raphe anlage in the follicular epithelium are early indicators of the dorsoventral axis of the house fly egg cell. In cross sections of the ovary the follicles are arranged in several concentric circles. The dorsal sides of all follicles within the ovary are oriented to an imaginary center. This center of orientation lies eccentrically near the medial part of the female abdomen. The resulting symmetrical pattern can be observed throughout the course of oogenesis. This implies that only a few follicles have the same dorsoventral orientation as the mother fly, and therefore this arrangement is contradictory to the imprinting hypotheses of body axis formation as well as to a possible inductive role of gravity. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Cautery of the dorsal hindwing in the butterfly, Precis coenia, induces the formation of a concentric colour pattern around the site of injury. The induced pattern is identical in pigmentation to the eyespots that normally develop on this wing surface. This response to cautery also occurs, though much less dramatically, on the ventral forewing. In addition to the peculiar response to cautery, the dorsal hindwing of Precis also develops a series of unique pattern aberrations in response to coldshock. These consist of irregular elongation of the anterior eyespot along the proximodistal axis of the wing. In the most dramatic aberrations the eyespot field covers the entire anterior half of the wing surface. An analysis is presented that attempts to reconcile the effects of cautery on the Precis hindwing with the very different morphological effects of cautery on the colour pattern of Ephestia kuhniella, described by Kuhn & Von Engelhardt. Computer simulations reveal that the finding presented in this paper, as well as the classical work on Ephestia, can both be explained by assuming that the site of cautery becomes a sink for one of the morphogens involved in colour pattern determination. The experimental findings furthermore indicate that minor perturbations of the wing epidermis can evoke the physiological conditions that attend normal eyespot determination. It is shown that this interpretation also helps to explain the unusual pattern modifications following coldshock.

AB  - Texas Electric Service Company (TESCo) has in operation approximately 2100 miles of buried 15 kV and 25 kV insulated cable. The great majority of this cable is cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated and has been installed in the last fifteen years. The predominant method of installation is direct burial. A review of some areas which have potential for producing cable failures is presented. The areas reviewed are those to which attention has been directed by some recent event or circumstance. The importance of cable specification and acceptance program is indicated, the failure rate due to cable defects, handling and installation, as well as corrosion and moisture, is evaluated. Some guidelines on preventing failure are given.

AB  - A wide-field color-coded infra-red imaging device was applied to the measurement of i) the temperature profile across the ocular surface and ii) the temporal stability of central corneal temperature, on 21 subjects. The thermographs showed a pattern of ellipsoidal isotherms (major axis horizontal) approximately concentric about a temperature apex (coldest point) which was slightly inferior to the geometric center of the cornea (GCC). The GCC had a mean temperature (± SD) of 34.3 ± 0.7°C (range 32.8 to 35.4°C). Temperature increased towards the periphery of the cornea with the limbus being 0.45°C warmer than the GCC (p < 0.0001). Following a blink, the GCC cooled at a mean (± SD) rate of 0.033 ± 0.024°C/s (p < 0.0001) over the first 15s. Subjects whose corneas cooled more slowly following a blink demonstrated a greater capacity to avoid blinking for a prolonged period (p < 0.05). This improved method of measuring ocular surface temperature has important applications in modeling corneal physiology and pathology.

AB  - About 50 different fiber optic rotary connectors, or fiber optic slip rings, have been built or described in the literature. These are devices for transmitting fiber optic signals across a rotating interface. The simplest are single channel slip rings where two multimode fibers face each other across a rotary interface. Losses are in the 3-4 dB range, or 1.5-3 dB if lenses are used to inject or collect light across the air gap, and light can be transmitted in either direction. Multiple channel optical slip rings have the advantage of redundancy and transmitting more data, omitting the necessity of multiplexing, while possibly freeing the rotational axis of the slip ring for a microwave, hydraulic, or pneumatic rotary joint. A number of different designs have been advanced which can be grouped into (1) concentric annular fiber bundles, (2) circular waveguides comprising open reflective channels or transparent dielectrics in the form of rings, rods, tubes, or wrapped fiber, (3) derotating intermediate optical components comprising prisms, mirrors, or fiber bundles, and (4) coaxial arrangement of mirrors and lenses rotating synchronously. These devices are primarily for large diameter multimode fiber and are often described for passive or active operation, i.e. they may incorporate active light sources and receivers rather than passively transmitting light supplied by optical fiber. The technical challenge in building a multiple, off-axis fiber optic slip ring is having incoming light available for transmission over 360 of rotation, transmitting the light across the rotational interface with minimum light loss, dispersion, and modulation, then collecting sufficient light on the receiving side for further transmission. Important causes of light loss in optical slip rings are axial and angular misalignment of the two rotating members, Fresnel losses, and lens to fiber misalignment. During operation losses may result from dust; fogging, breakage, aging, elevated temperatures, and radiation. The system designer must carefully consider matching the slip ring to the light modulation method to avoid degrading or distorting signal transmission. An ideal optical slip ring would be passive, off-axis, bidirectional, achromatic, and capable of supporting any size single or multimode fiber. © 1988, SPIE.

AB  - The displays of Argusianus argus are more elaborate than those of any other pheasant. They were studied with respect to their motivation and the significance to the female of eye‐like markings. The origins and functions of the displays, and the behavioural mechanisms which might have promoted the evolution of eyelike markings are considered, and parallels drawn with the visual effect presented by the displays of lekking birds. Die Balz des Argusfasans ist länger, komplizierter und enthält mehr Bewegungselemente als die Balz irgend eines anderen Fasans. Jedes Männchen legt einen Balzplatz auf einer Hügelkuppe an und hält ihn sauber; es wedelt mit den Flügeln, wirft Laub beiseite und pickt überhängendes Gezweig weg. Dieses Säubern entwickelte sich wahrscheinlich aus der Nahrungssuche. Die Weibchen werden durch laute Rufe angelockt. 11 Balzelemente werden als Ergebnis widerstreitender Flucht‐, Angriffsund Balztendenzen gedeutet. Am Ende der Balz steht das Männchen dem Weibchen gegenüber. Seine verlängerten Flügelfedern sind kegelförmig wie ein Fächer aufgestellt, die strahlenförmig angeordneten “Augen” ‐reihen laufen zum wirklichen Auge des Männchens zusammen. Das Weibchen steckt so zur Hälfte in einem Augenkegel. Bei anderen Fasanen balzen die Männchen in Arenen, und die Weibchen wählen ein (zentrales) Männchen aus. Beim Argusfasan balzt das Männchen allein, umgibt sich aber mit einem “Arena‐Bilderwald” aus eigenen Federn. 1982 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - The developing avian cornea is enclosed within a nerve ring from which numerous neurites extend into the cornea as radially ingrowing, regularly bifurcating fascicles. The authors now assess the degree of positional specificity of developing corneal nerves by photographic comparison and digital computer signal averaging. Such analyses demonstrate that nerves display extensive homology of position within the developing nerve ring, indicating that their growth cones originally followed specific pathways around the cornea. During their extension within the cornea, nerve fascicles bifurcate only within distinct, successive, and concentric zones suggesting that the position of an intra-corneal nerve branch point is designated by the intra-corneal milieu. Since the distance between the branch zones reported here increases with corresponding corneal growth, neurite elongation may occur both at the growth cone and along the axon at inter-branch sites of extending corneal nerves.

AB  - Urinary stones are normally composed of innumerable, very small crystals, held together by fine, distributed organic cement substance (stone-matrix). Often, the crystals are deposited in very thin layers. In some stones (e.g. uric acid stones), the layers are concentric ('annual circles') and give evidence of a discontinuous growth, reflecting the 'aggressive' and 'resting' periods. A special case is the thin phosphate shell on uric acid stones, sometimes formed from alkaline urine, preventing the chemolitholysis of the stone. These facts give evidence of a growing mechanism that is based on adhering and sticking of temporarily formed urinary crystals on the surface of growing stone, being mediated by the reactive organic cement substance, and only to a lesser extent on the enlargement of single crystals, anchored in the stone-nidus. The reactive layer on the surface of the growing calculus can be seen in the adhering, partially hemolysed blood cells, eventually combined with traces of albumin. This surface layer can be regularly restored by the microamounts of blood and mobilized by mechanical irritation of the urothelium in the near vicinity of the growing stone. In our conception, the partial hemolysis of urinary blood cells must be realized as an additional factor. The 'aggressive' episodes would therefore reflect the situations when crystalluria is connected with hematuria and partial hemolysis.

AB  - A liquid-liquid extractor equipped with 25 kHz ultrasonic horn through which feed (methyl-isobutyl ketone (MIBK), dissolved with butyric acid) can be dispersed into solvent (water) was newly developed and its performance and characteristics were investigated experimentally. The extraction rate in this extractor was remarkably enhanced because the interfacial contact area between feed droplets and solvent is conspicuously increased by emulsification with ultrasonic irradiation. The effects of residence time in the extractor, volumetric fraction of feed and input power of the ultrasonic generator on the capacity coefficient were experimentally investigated by use of MIBK-butyric acid-water as a sample, and an experimental equation representing the correlation between the capacity coefficient and these factors was proposed. Results showed that the capacity coefficient was about forty times that of the usual perforated-plate extraction tower for the same system. The over-all mass transfer coefficient, KR, was calculated with the capacity coefficient and the interfacial contact area, which was obtained from the drop size distribution measured by a photomicrograph. It was seen that KR obtained is slightly smaller than that of usual extractors and the conspicuous increase in the extraction rate depends mainly on the increase in the interfacial contact area. Furthermore, mass transfer from feed droplets to solvent was analyzed theoretically by assuming that a feed droplet is surrounded by a concentric spherical shell of solvent and that mass transfer by diffusion occurs in unsteady state, and the theoretical result was compared with the experimental ones. © 1984, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

AB  - By using a method which avoids solving the canonical problem, we build the displacement field that corresponds to the propagation of P and SV waves in an infinite elastic space which contains a source placed outside an elastic sphere and emitting P and SV waves. The result is generalized to the case of a space containing a finite number of concentric spheres.-English summary

AB  - The course of attacks by anthracnosis and by the eye spot disease on branches, leaves, and fruits of Coffea arabica L. were investigated in Cuba. The daily precipitation and the shading are most influential for both diseases. There are marked differences in the attacks between the rainy season (highest attacks) and dry season (decreased attacks). Lack of shading increases the susceptibility of the plants to the eye spot disease. Under the conditions in Cuba, unshaded plantations exhibited an increased occurrence of anthracnosis. In order to predict the occurrence of anthracnosis, it is necessary to know the seasonal course of the sporulation capacity of the agent on the branches, for the eye spot disease to know the course of attacks on the leaves. The possibilities are discussed of controlling the two diseases.

AB  - Subluxation of the hip and subsequent acetabular dysplasia were experimentally produced by fixing the knee of young rabbits in extension position. Changes of the acetabulum during the repair process after reduction were investigated radiologically, histologically and histomorphometrically. Radiologically, subluxation and acetabular dysplasia appeared two weeks after fixation and disappeared as the knee became flexible after removal of fixation. Histologically, abnormalities of growth cartilage and hypertrophy of trabeculae in the secondary spongiosa were prominent two weeks after fixation. Histomorphometrically, the bone area, osteoid surface and mineral appositional rate increased at this time. The above findings, however, were normalized as concentric reduction of the hip was achieved. Abnormal stress acting on the acetabulum caused hypertrophy of trabeculae, and this may result in the development of osteoarthritis. In order to prevent such a pathologic process, it is important to normalize the hip mechanically from the view point of bone dynamics.

AB  - The impact of concentric lane-markings on vehicle deflection, speed and accidents has been investigated for five selected roundabouts in Tyne and Wear. An analysis of Stats 19 accident data at and around the selected roundabouts before and after the implementation of the markings fails to indicate that a significant reduction in the accident rate resulted from this traffic management measure. The evidence presented here also fails to support the notion that the markings cause drivers going straight ahead to deflect more, although there does appear to be some reduction in speed.

AB  - Domestic chicks show fear and avoidance of certain monochromatic, two-dimensional eye-like shapes. The tranquilliser Pacitran (CIBA) will reduce fear-induced sterotypies an adult fowl and alleviate fear of a novel environment and startling stimulus (loud bell) in chicks (unpublished observation). The author tested whether fear and avoidance of the eye-shape could be reduced by the administration of Pacitran. Two hours before testing, each chick was injected subcutaneously with either 0.1 ml purified water (control group) or with 50 μg Pacitran in 0.1 ml water (approximately equivalent to 1.2 mg/kg body weight. Pacitran (Ciba) is a solution of methyl-18-epi-O-methylreserpate hydrochloride; it is a reserpine derivative and therefore a tranquilliser of rauwolfia-alkaloid type. Each chick was tested individually and once only; it was placed on an imaginary mid-line of the test box facing the eye model. Testing was carried out between 10.00 and 14.00 h; the order of testing was randomised and the box was turned between tests to reduce positional cues. Avoidance was evaluated by the accumulated time spent in each half of the box, 450 seconds in each half would indicate no avoidance. Immobility (freezing, sitting, lying, eye-closure), which is positively related to fear was decreased, while activity (steps, jumps) and vocalisation, which are inversely related to fear were enhanced by Pacitran. Chicks from both treatment groups avoided the eyeshape (P < 0.001; t test) but aversion was markedly stronger in the water-injected group. Thus, tranquillisation reduced fear and avoidance of the eye model.

AB  - Damage caused by Porotermes adamsoni and its effect on log quality were investigated in coastal lowland eucalypt forests in eastern Tasmania. In two study areas, 60 per cent and 43 per cent of trees sampled had been damaged by P. adamsoni. All eucalypt species (6) were attacked and there was no significant difference between species in the proportion of trees so affected. The incidence of damage increased directly with diameter class and 90 per cent of trees over 105 cm stump diameter were found to be affected. The pattern of damage within attacked trees is described.The main effect of damage by P. adamsoni was excessive centre defect (‘pipe’ in the heart of the tree, with concentrically arranged galleries, sometimes associated with decay) resulting in downgrading of potential sawlog to pulpwood or waste. Sixty per cent of assessed sawlogs were rejected after cutting due to excessive defect and 43 per cent of all potential pulpwood logs were graded as optional pulpwood. © 1984 Taylor and Francis, LLC.

AB  - Controlling interstand tension by roll gap adjustment, rather than by roll speed adjustment, is the key to improvement of product on cold tandem mills. Control allows the mass flow rate of material from one stand to the next to be maintained constant. This prevents the imprinting of imperfections from each stand into the strip. Two examples of imperfections could be lack of concentricity in the rolls and variations in the oil film thickness in the support roll bearings during mill acceleration.

AB  - Flowmetering errors arising from elastic deflection of a plate were quantified and equations to choose correct thicknesses of plates to minimize these errors and avoid plastic buckling were achieved. Differences between expressions for metering error are explained. The limit on plate flatness in ISO 5167 and AGA 3 is shown to be inadequate and to lead to systematic measurement errors of up to 0.2%. An experimental investigation into the effect of plate eccentricity on the accuracy of measurement is reported. Limits in ISO 5167 are extremely difficult to meet except in specialist laboratories. Air flow tests on 5 plates ranging from 0.75 to 0.2 beta ratio in a 150 mm line show that these concentricity limits can be substantially relaxed if an increase in uncertainty of 0.1% can be tolerated.

AB  - In an effort to analyze human travel-activity patterns, this paper clarifies the effects of the individual characteristics of urban residents on their outdoor behavior patterns which contain two dimensions: their sociodemographics and their location within a city. Previous studies have investigated mainly the relationship between travel and socio-demographic factors, while few works examine the impact of location factors. Sociodemographics in themselves, however, depend on the location within a city, as earlier social area analysts have found. This paper, therefore, focuses on how social area structure influences outdoor behavior patterns. The outdoor behavior pattern is described by the chain of travel purposes in which the individual leaves his home and returns there again. The following are found to be the main patterns the residents follow and their percentages among all the outdoor behavior: 1. Outdoor Discretionary Activity→Return Home (24%) 2. Attending School→Return Home (22%) 3. Attending Work→Return Home (22%) 4. Outdoor Business Activity→Return Home (6%) 5. Outdoor Discretionary Activity→Outdoor Discretionary Activity→Return Home (3%) 6. Attending Work→Outdoor Business Activity→Return to Work Place→Return Home (2%) 7. Attending Work→Outdoor Discretionary Activity→Return Home (2%) 8. Attending Work→Outdoor Discretionary Activity→Return to Work Place→Return Home (1%) Fifteen percent of all residents never went out of their home all day, which is the ninth pattern. As the result of this analysis, it become clear that the socio-demographics and social area structures have strong impact on the generation and location of stops of outdoor behavior patterns, that is: (1) The commuting patterns are divided into two types: White-collar commuters, who reside mainly in the eastern area of Nagoya city, tend to perform multipurpose travel toward the city core (Patterns 6, 7, 8). Blue-collar commuters, residing in the western area, take the simple round trip between home and the nearer work place (Pattern 3). (2) In the discretionary activity patterns (Patterns 1, 5), most stops occur at areas near-by residents homes. All the same, the residents in the eastern area tend to engage in their activities at the city core during the course of multi-purpose travel, as well as in their commuting patterns. (3) Attending school pattern (Pattern 2) is performed by students and pupils. Because they are concentrated in suburban areas, the generation of this pattern is remarkable in the outer zone of a city. (4) Business activity pattern (Pattern 4) is performed mainly by the workers whose work places correspond to their own residences. They are concentrated in the urban core area, so that the pattern is distinctive there. (5) The ninth pattern is also conspicuous in the urban core area, because people who never went out of their home are mainly elderly or the jobless, and they are concentrated in the urban core area. In summary, the commuting patterns and the discretionary activity patterns were closely related to the sectoral pattern of urban social area structure, while the other outdoor behavior patterns reflected the concentric structure. © 1985, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

AB  - High latitude intracontinental seaways occupy great troughs carved by broad tongues of inland ice as it debouched to deep marine water. Such troughs occur in glaciated coasts, but not in stable, nonglaciated ones. Where ice flowed along the walls of troughs whose adjacent uplands held local glaciers, the walls simulate alpine troughs with faceted spurs and submarine hanging tributary valleys. Where uplands were not glaciated, trough walls are unbreached. Where ice flowed across them, coasts are digitate in low relief. In the northeastern sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, large glacial grooves converge toward the Gulf of Boothia-Prince Regent Inlet-Lancaster Sound avenue of egress to open sea, suggesting that it was an exit for inland ice which shaped it to its present form. The subduction Pacific coast of the Americas is mostly harborless in nonglaciated latitudes, but in southern Chile and British Columbia it is dissected. A circular gravity high 2800 km across is concentric with the area covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Abyssal glacial silts are voluminous enough to account for an average of 100-150 m of erosion over the area covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. © 1988.

AB  - The unusual tetrahedral shape of Hydrurus foetidus (Vill.) Trev. zoospores is associated with a complex skeletal system of microtubules extending from a broad flagellar root (up to 19 microtubules) into each of three, pointed anterior processes. The posterior end, also pointed and supported by a separate set of microtubules, contains a single large chloroplast with a prominent posterior furrow containing mitochondrial elements. A large immersed pyrenoid is penetrated by paired thylakoids. There is no eyespot. Numerous large Golgi bodies occur immediately anterior to the nucleus and up to 5–6 contractile vacuoles lie near the cell surface at the anterior end. Two terminally inserted flagella extend from the cell surface, a long one serving for cell locomotion, and the other vestigial with an axonemal pattern of 9+0. The flagellar root system consists of: (1) a thin, striated rhizoplast extending from the basal body of the long flagellum and ramifying over the surface of a conspicuous, anteriorly directed, conical projection of the nucleus; (2) a broad microtubular root which emanates from near the basal body of the long flagellum and appears to function as a MTOC; (3) a compound root, consisting of a striated fiber and two associated microtubules, which runs alongside the basal body of the stubby flagellum before terminating at the cell surface; and (4) a short two‐membered microtubular root, also associated with the basal body of the stubby flagellum. Other components of the flagellar apparatus include a large dense body near the proximal end of the basal body of the short flagellum, and a small, dense, core‐like structure closely associated with one of its triplet fibers. The flagellar apparatus of H. foetidus is remarkably similar in ultrastructure to that of Chrysonebula holmesii Lund. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - An explanation is developed for the adaptive significance of the forms characteristic of the dry season and wet season adult generations of some tropical butterflies. The divergent phenotypes are accounted for as adaptive responses to a shift in the optimum balance between dependence on the alternative (but interdependent) strategies of active anti‐predator devices and of crypsis. The seasonal polyphenisms exhibited by the satyrines Melanitis leda (Fabricius) and Orsotrioena medus (Fabricius) and the nymphalid Junonia almana (Linné) are examined in detail. The wet season forms show prominent marginal eyespot patterns which are displayed at rest and function principally in the deflection of attacks by vertebrate predators. In contrast, the dry season forms show very small or no spots and are wholly cryptic. Wet season butterflies are more active in general than those in the dry season when aestivation behaviour is often observed. The alternative phenotypes represent responses to the differences in behaviour, environment and nature of predation. Reproductive success is optimized in each season by an interaction of phenotype and behaviour. The hypothesis must be tested in detail by an investigation of the behavioural ecology and population biology of particular species. It is argued that these seasonal polyphenisms provide examples of adaptations to a repeating pattern of changing environments where the mode of selection is, in broad terms, understood.

AB  - The physical shielding phenomenon by shrouding gas jet and the back-pressure were studied in a water model in view of the erosion of refractory near the tuyere tip in steelmaking processes. Mixing of two concentric gas jets near the tuyere tip when dissimilar gases are blown horizontally into water through the annular tuyere has been measured by use of gas-chromatograph at various total gas flow rates (30 - 360 Nl/min) and ratios of core/annular gas flow rates (2/1 - 11/1) with core gas linear velocities at the tuyere tip in the range of 40 - 400 m/sec. Oxygen was blown through the inner pipe (4. 0 mm i. d. and 4. 5 mm o. d. ) and nitrogen through the annular pipe (5. 2 mm i. d. and 6. 5 mm o. d. ). The back-attack phenomenon caused by the instability of jets was also measured by pressure transducer and analysed by digital memory oscilloscope. From these results, the gas flow rates and the ratio of core/annular gas flow rates are considered to be important factors for the physical shielding by shrouding gas jet and for the back-attack phenomenon in annular tuyere blowing processes such as the AOD process.

AB  - The release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) was examined in the rabbit carotid artery 6 weeks after denudation with an inflated balloon catheter in vivo. A concentric, fibromuscular intimal thickening of variable width developed in all areas lined with either regenerated endothelium or modified luminal smooth muscle cells. In vitro studies showed that in vessels precontracted with serotonin, only the re-endothelialized areas could relax to the endothelium-dependent dilators methacholine, substance P and the Ca2+ionophore A23187. Re-endothelialized areas with large concentric, fibromuscular intimal thickening (between 10 and 20 cells thick) relaxed with a similar sensitivity and maximum to methacholine compared with control areas. It is concluded that (1) newly generated endothelial cells release EDRF whilst the specialized lining smooth muscle cells present 6 weeks after injury do not, and (2) that the presence of a large fibromuscular intima does not prevent EDRF from reaching the media to cause relaxation. © 1987 S.

AB  - A new disk format and a new recorder were developed based on the still picture disk file system which was put on the market a few years ago, whereby a video disk system that permits concurrent continuous recording of video and audio signals has been developed. In order to achieve a prolonged recording time, the disk track pitch was narrowed from the conventional 2.5 μm to 1.6 μm and a contrivance was also made circuit-wise to eliminate the resulting cross talk interference. Because of these innovations, 13.3 minutes (24,000 frames) of continuous recording is now realized on a disk 20 cm in diameter. For a continuous recording of sound signals, a continuous track is necessary. To solve this problem, a spiral track was developed in lieu of the conventional concentric track. To indicate addresses, this track is locally interrupted. Such interruptions would normally interfere with sound recording but such interferences could be prevented by selecting the optimum relation between the length of interruptions and the sound carrier frequency. © 1985 SPIE.

AB  - Using the HRP retrograde transport technique in two different genera of owls (Speotyto and Tyto), we have studied the distribution of neurons projecting to the optic tectum and the visual thalamus. Small injections of HRP were made into these structures from the pial surface after they had been visualized directly by dissection of the overlying bone. In contrast to the findings in mammals, retinal ganglion cells were labeled only in the eye contralateral to the injection site, whether this was in the thalamus or tectum, and the labeled ganglion cells were found on both nasal and temporal sides of the vertical retinal meridian through the fovea. After thalamic injection, labeling was prominent in temporal retina representing the binocular field, temporal to the optic nerve head. Retinothalamic ganglion cells formed roughly concentric lines of isodensity centered on the fovea (Speotyto) or area centralis (Tyto); labeling form thalamic injections involved both large and medium‐sized neurons, but did not involve the smallest nor a conspicuous class of very large neurons. Tectal injections led to prominent labeling along the horizontal streak region, with horizontally elongated isodensity contours in both Tyto and Speotyto; retinotectal ganglion cells were heterogeneous and included a group of very large neurons and another group of small neurons, neither of which was labeled from the thalamus. In the visual Wulst, labeled neurons were confined to the supragranular layers after both tectal and thalamic injections. Corticotectal neurons were found in both ipsilateral and contralateral visual Wulst. They were characterized by large cell bodies and prominent dendrites. Corticotectal neurons were distributed throughout the mediolateal extent of the ipsilateral Wulst and therefore involved both the monocular and binocular representations of the visual field. Corticothalamic neurons, found only in the ipsilateral Wulst, were characterized by smaller cell bodies and fine dendrites. They were confined to the monocular crescent on the extreme medial edge of the Wulst. Copyright © 1981 Alan R. Liss, Inc.

AB  - The parameters for explosive welding of Stainless Steel to Titanium were determined with the objective to avoid intermetallic compounds and tubular needles at the interface. The optimum parameters were applied for the production of tubular transition joints between Titanium and stainless steel for ultra high vacuum applications. Prototypes were examined mechanically and by metallographic methods and tested under ultra high vacuum conditions. An extraordinary mechanical strength of the connection is found, and, in contrary to transition joints, produced by other means, not a single leak occurred in joints fabricated by concentric explosive cladding.

AB  - The reported mechanisms responsible are attack by sulfides, ammonia or low pH; stray currents, ac rectification by Cu oxide or depolarization by ac; galvanic attack due to C-filled conductor shields and oxygen concentration cells. Preventive measures include cathodic protection, insulating or semiconductive jackets, and materials selection. A material solution is a steel clad Cu wire with an anodic outer coating which will provide galvanic protection for the Cu.

AB  - The control of spot pattern variation on both hindwing and forewing in 16 F1 broods of Maniola jurtina is analysed. Substantial additive genetic variance was demonstrated for each of the spot pattern characters. For example, estimates for heritability of hindwing spot-number were 0.66 ± 0.11 in males and 0.89±0.11 in females. These estimates were essentially the same when four broods with extremes of low or high mortality were excluded from the analysis. The hindwing traits showed a consistent pattern of a closer resemblance of offspring to the same sex than to the opposite sex parent. This can also be expressed in a genetic correlation between the same trait in the two sexes that is (much) less than 1.0. Further analysis strongly suggested that this follows from a partially sex-dependent expression of some of the individual spots. In constrast to the hindwing traits, there may be a maternal effect in the inheritance of the forewing “eyespot”. The fact that relative differences in spot-number between populations tended to be maintained when wild larvae were reared in the laboratory and experiments which showed no significant influence of varying temperature or relative humidity during periods of the pupal stage on spot phenotype suggest that the estimates of heritability are likely to be close to those which pertain in natural conditions. Analysis of data for relative hindwing spot-size in the broods provides some support for a threshold model for spot development. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

AB  - The lesions associated with a syndrome of sudden death in adult hens is described. The syndrome occurred primarily in broiler-breeder hens and in three flocks of commercial egg-laying strains. All flocks were housed on deep litter. Deaths occurred from 24 to 26 weeks of age until approximately 30 weeks of age. Congestion and oedema of viscera occurred consistently and concentric or eccentric myocardial hypertrophy associated with left atrial endocardial fibroelastosis occurred in many birds. The cause of the syndrome has not been determined. The findings of cardiac failure, myocardial hypertrophy and the lack of cause or distinct myocardial lesions qualifies this syndrome as a cardiomyopathy. © 1983, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Data from the 1978 "Cobblestone Project" Deep Tow surveys and associated intensive sampling programs have been combined with published data to address the question: "Are the Mediterranean- and Calabrian Ridge convergent plate margin accretionary prisms?". A dome-shaped feature on the crest of the Mediterranean Ridge was found to be made of sticky and watery mud breccia of Early Cretaceous age. Its circular plan view, concentric surface deformation, old but uniform-aged clasts and matrix, diachronous Quaternary veneer, brecciated texture and plastic matrix suggest a piercement structure, but the total lack of evaporitic or dolomitic lithologies, the thinness of both Messinian evaporites and Plio-Quaternary cover in the observation area and the great age and presumably great depth of the Cretaceous mother bed, rule out simple salt diapirism. We suggest instead that the diapir rose from the overpressured zone at the base of a deep seated overthrust, where grinding and injection of water shattered a low permeability shale layer and reduced its density and effective viscosity. The perimeters of the Calabrian- and Mediterranean Ridge are marked by an abrupt transition ("deformation front") from flat abyssal plains to ridge-and-trough morphology. The deformation front apparently migrates outward with time and is the site of uplift and folding of abyssal plain sediments: A search for analogous "deformation fronts" in better understood convergent plate margins revealed a very close analogy with the toe of the Curacao- and Barbados Ridge which are interpreted as classic accretionary wedges. The analogy is further supported in the Calabrian Ridge case by the observation of an arcward-dipping reflector, which may be the detachment surface, beneath a thickening wedge of Messinian evaporites. Extension of the analogy requires that the outcrop of the subduction zone or the site of initiation of decollement be located external to the Mediterranean Ridge and not in the Hellenic Trough. Our surveys showed that (except possibly along the recently deformed outermost perimeter of the deformation front) the surface of both ridges is extensively modified by the secondary processes of diapirism, dissolution, mass-wasting and downhill gliding. Thus the fine-scale surface morphology alone, as revealed by Seabeam, Deep-Tow or GLORIA, may be a poor or misleading indicator of deep crustal processes in this region. © 1982.

AB  - An ion mobility detector has been designed and constructed for direct axial interfacing with capillary gas chromatography. The principle advantages of this detector were the following: (1) Direct concentric introduction of the capillary column into the ionization region, eliminating peak broadening in the transfer line and improving the efficiency with which neutral molecules were swept from the detector. (2) A variable capillary insertion distance, providing a sensitivity/resolution interplay that could be modified in response to the needs of the assay. (3) An inert gas flow external to the drift cylinder, preventing atmospheric impurities from infiltrating the ultratrace detector. Qualitative and quantitative capabilities of the detector were evaluated using standard preparations of n-hexyl ether. © 1989.

AB  - A cartridge disk seal for preventing contaminated air from entering into the interior of a cartridge through an running clearance between a housing of the cartridge and a hub when the cartridge is mounted on a spindle of a disk drive is described. It comprises an annular member mounted on the housing of the spindle for abutment against a bottom surface of the housing. The annular member has three concentric channels opening toward the bottom surface. An annular flexible tubular sealing member is mounted on an inner one of the channels, an intermediate one of the channels being connectable to a source of pressurized air. An annular flap sealing member is mounted in an outer one of the channels, a portion of the annular member separating the intermediate channel and outer channel. Pressurized air from the intermediate channel is allowed to enter the outer channel and force the flap sealing member into abutment with the bottom surface. (6 claims: 2 figs.) (from abstract)

AB  - Watkinson et al. (1978) have reinterpreted the Zn-Cu deposits in the Ransko massif as xenoliths of volcanogenic ores enclosed in and contact-metamorphosed by a basic magma. A detailed reexamination of different xenoliths within the massif, and their comparison with the cordierite hornfelses carriers of Zn-Cu ores, has shown essential differences between them, and confirmed the previous opinions on the metasomatic origin of the deposits. The cordierite hornfels originated by selective magnesian metasomatism of intrusive rocks rich in feldspar (quartz diorite, troctolite), particularly by the replacement of feldspars by cordierite. Around the stocks of cordierite hornfels, a conspicuous concentric metasomatic zonation of rocks developed in mafic intrusives. The Zn-Cu deposits of the Ransko massif resemble sulfide deposits connected with magnesian metasomatism, especially those of the Hitachi area in Japan. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Tubing conveyed techniques have been successfully applied in through-tubing remedial operations where excessive hole deviation and/or helical buckling have prevented conventional wireline or electric line operations. Perforating and setting bridge plugs have been performed using a concentric work string and a pressure actuated firing head. Two case histories, in which remaining reserves would not support the cost of a conventional rig workover, are presented. These cases describe procedures which were used successfully in remedial operations.

AB  - Coating materials for optical fibers must be chosen with close attention to the manner in which their properties affect fiber performance. The ability to protect fiber strength and to provide resistance to excess transmission losses caused by microbending are the most important functions of the coating. Two basic considerations that govern fiber strength are the avoidance of damage to the glass surface during coating application and the quality of the applied coating. There are several factors related to the quality of the coating: coating concentricity, incomplete coatings, coating mechanical integrity, and particle contaminants in the coating. An examination is also made of microbending loss and its effect on fiber performance, microbending loss related to coating properties, and microbending in fiber cables.

AB  - The relation between cardiac muscle mechanics and left ventricular (LV) pump function is simulated by a mathematical model. In the following article special attention is paid to the relation between LV pressure and LV volume on the one hand and the transmural distribution of sarcomere length and fiber stress on the other. The LV is simulated by a thick-walled cylinder composed of 8 concentric shells. The myocardial material is assumed to be anisotropic. The orientation and sequential activation of the muscle fibers across the LV wall are considered per shell. Twisting of the base with respect to the apex around the axis of the LV is simulated by rotation of the upper cross-sectional surface of the cylinder with respect to the lower one aroud the axis of the cylinder. The model reveals that twisting of the LV is an important means to equalize transmural differences in sarcomere shortening and end-systolic fiber stress. When torsion is allowed, transmural differences in sarcomere shortening and end-systolic fiber stress are less than 18% and 16%, respectively. When torsion is prevented as in most of the models of LV-mechanics described in literature, these transmural differences increase up to 32% and 42%, respectively. © 1979 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - By analyzing the surface configurations of the telencephalon of the bottlenose dolphin and four other cetacean species, we have been able to delineate the major sulcal and gyral patterns, define the basic lobular organization of the highly gyrencephalic cetacean brain and describe the general organization of the brain surface into major cortical territories. Although the cetacean endbrain presents many general mammalian features, the surface configurations of the brains of these aquatic mammals differ in many significant details from the patterns of other mammals. These departures are subtle in the rhinencephalic (median) zone of the telencephalon, are more prominent in the limbic (paramedian) zone and become outspoken in the dorso-lateral and posterior zones of the fundus of the hemispheres. The latter zones of the fundus display the widest interspecies variability as well as the most marked individual intraspecies variability among Cetacea. The more salient general features we have observed are: 1. (1) pronounced antero-posterior foreshortening of the forebrain with enhanced dorsal proplasia of the parietal lobes, blunting of the occipital lobes, and ventro-lateral proplasia of the temporal lobes; 2. (2) great transverse width of the dorso-lateral and posterior (epihippocampal) parts of the hemispheres and reduced width of the antero-ventral (epistriatal) parts; 3. (3) conspicuously small hippocampus contrasting with the great mass of the epihippocampal parts of the hemispheres; 4. (4) large olfactory lobes and massive septal area contrasting with small orbital lobes and striatum; 5. (5) relatively large insula, buried under a massive operculum, the latter disposed as a discrete lobule demarcated from the dorso-lateral wall of the hemisphere by a deep arcuate fissure; 6. (6) presence of a paralimbic lobe, unique in Cetacea, intercalated on the medial wall of the hemisphere between limbic and supralimbic lobes and covered by a special heterotypical cortex of the sensorimotor type-agranular motor anteriorly, granular somesthetic dorsally, and modified koniogranulose visual posteriorly; 7. (7) some degree of cytoarchitectonic homogeneity though areal differences can be resolved and some apparent homogeneity may be due to the gradual transition of one area into the other which is characteristic of the cetacean cortical areas; and 8. (8) unusual organization of the homotypical cortex of "associational" type. However, a resolution of this latter must wait thorough architectonic evaluation of the entire supralimbic lobe. The surface demarcation of the rhinencephalon and the cleavage of each hemisphere into concentric tiers (limbic, paralimbic and supralimbic) are sharper and clearer in the cetacean brain than in any other mammalian brain. The segregation of the special heterotypical cortices in the paralimbic lobe, cleaved from the medial hemispheric wall by arcuate longitudinal clefts, is, as far as we have been able to determine, unique for Cetacea. In contrast to primates, in which the somatic sensorimotor and special sensory cortices are widely separated by broad expanses of homotypical cortex (association cortex), these intimately thalamus-bound special heterotypical cortical areas in Cetacea remain largely on the dorsomedial wall of the hemisphere bordering on the epihippocampal limbus, and do not appear to extend onto the supralimbic fundus of the hemisphere. This uniquely cetacean feature characterizes one of the most interesting aspects of the evolution of the brain in these totally aquatic mammals. © 1980.

AB  - The 'false head' hypothesis states that due to the posterior ventral wing markings of certain butterflies which resemble a 'false head', visually hunting predators, such as birds, are deceived into attacking the hind wing area rather than the true head of the butterfly. Six groups of artificially marked dead cabbage butterflies Pieris rapae were presented to blue jays Cyanocitta cristata. Of the six 'false head', markings, only the eyespot significantly influenced the point of attack. All of the 'false head' markings, however, led to a greater proportion of attacks to the hind wing area of the butterfly. In the course of prey handling following an initial attack, each of the 6 'false head' markings significantly directed predator handling strikes away from the true head of captive butterflies to the anal angle of the hind wing. In a 2nd experiment, live P. rapae with 'false head' markings were mishandled and thus escaped, significantly more frequently than controls. 'False head' markings may thus confer a selective advantage by increasing the probability of escape, particularly during handling.-from Authors

AB  - A line sample injector was attached to a conventional glass concentric nebulizer with a small volume (~35 cm3) spray chamber. In order to prevent the sample from being diluted with carrier water, the sample was injected into a small air bubble (5~0µl) which was formed by lifting the entrance of the carrier tubing above water for a short time. When 40-µl samples were introduced, peak line intensities decreased to about 65% of those obtained by continuous nebulization, and detection limits of various elements were about 5 times higher than those of the conventional method. However, this method generally suffers from less matrix effects than the conventional method and allows to introduce solutions with higher salt and organic solvent concentrations. The relative standard deviations of the intensity measurements were about 4% in all the concentration ranges except near the detection limits. © 1980, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

AB  - Effects of preceding “break crops” on winter wheat and influence of cultural practices Between 1979—83 there was tested the effect of 5 “break crops” (biennial alfalfa, clover‐grass, faba bean, winter‐rape, silomaize) on succeeding winter wheat and the interaction with changed cultural practices such as N‐fertilization and conventional or reduced primary tillage (plough ↔ rotary tiller). After the break crops wheat yield decreased within a range of 4 dt/ha as follows: alfalfa → beans → rape/ clover‐grass/maize. Raising N‐fertilization hardly allowed to improve the value of the break crops; most likely that of maize and with rotavating. Adaption of N‐dressings promised greater influence. The manner of primary tillage exerted stronger influence on the yield than the level of N‐fertilization. Concerning long‐term yield the rotary tiller equaled the plough after 4 break crops; after faba bean it was superior. Increasing N‐fertilization tendentially favoured the rotary tiller after bean, rape and maize. Using the rotary tiller, at beginning of growth there may be calculated on 15 % higher NO3‐values and/or higher N‐mineralization or N‐transformation. Eyespot disease could not be prevented sufficiently and purposefully by an other break crop, N‐fertilization or primary tillage. Recurrent rotavating suppressed weed less than ploughing.

AB  - Perinatal mortality is closely related to infant birth weight. Howevere, the examination of both gestational age and birth weight provides a more comprehensive approach. This study presents a method of evaluation which is readily applicable. Data were obtained from the computerized files of the maternity ward of the University Hospital of Caen. This report is based on case-reports of 17,952 single births, from May 1980 to July 1985 (cases of multiple birth have not been considered since their age/weight relationships are usually different). All stillborn infants and those who died within the first week of life were considered. Any infant whose gestational age was 28 weeks or more but who showed no sign of life at birth was considered stillborn. Gestational age was determined from the mother's last menstrual period, providing it concurred with the obstetrical evaluaton (i.e. echographic measurements of foetus before 20 weeks of gestation). If not, the clinical evaluation was retained. Results are presented in the form of blocks, each one representing 1 week of gestational age and a birth weight of 500 g. The perinatal mortality rate was calculated for each block. Blocks of similar mortality rates (i.e. with no significant difference) were then pooled by means of a recently published method. This difference between the mortality rates of 2 blocks (in percentages) may be measured by means of the chi-square test. The test enables the evaluation of the 'distance' between two adjacent zones, which can be calculated for all the blocks of the graph, by twos. Then, two adjacent zones can be grouped providing they are mutually 'closest' (according to the previously defined distance). Nevertheless, a threshold distance is also defined, beyond which grouping is not allowed due to important differences between the zones (in this report, the degree of significance is p < 0.01). This procedure was repeated until there were no further possibilities for grouping. According to the gestational age alone, the perinatal mortality rate was 5.2 per 1,000 for infants at 35 weeks and more; for birth weight alone, the mortality was 4.0 per 1,000 for infants weighing more than 2,500 g. Statistical analysis allows us to classify the 17,952 births according to 8 zones of significantly different perinatal mortality rates (p < 0.01). As expected, the mortality risk is minimum above 3000 g/35 weeks. The other zones are displayed schematically in the shape of concentric semi-circles around this privileged zone. This 'shock wave' shows an increasingly higher mortality rate, reaching its maximum for infants weighing less than 1000 g. This method limits the random variability and, thus, outlines the major trends for perinatal mortality risks. In this way, the clinical investigator will be confronted with zones which 'speak for themselves'. It may be displayed in the maternity and neonatal intensive care units and, thus, facilitate the nursing staffs work. It is easy to compare results with those reported from other centres or from previous years. This can be achieved by selecting one block (weight/age) and trying to delineate the zone in which it is located as a function of time of space. This really is a simple means of evaluation, which is readily comprehensible. Our approach however has a few limitations: - The weight considered for stillborn infants is the weight at birth, and not the weight at the time of death. - Since it is based on computerized obstetrical case-reports, this study only involves the perinatal period. However, a shift of perinatal mortality is now occurring and it would be most interesting to consider the late neonatal and post-neonatal periods. - The insight provide to the physician is based on probability only. For a given infant, the quantal response prevails. But this applies to all risk factors. The study of perinatal mortality in relation to birth weight and gestational age should now be considered as a method for evaluation. This technique may also be used in the future to assess the efficacy of new perinatal procedures and to assist physicians as soon as a reliable ultrasound estimate of the fetal weight becomes available. The appeared graph is 'clinically understandable' and facilitates interpretation. Such an analysis is directly applicable since it takes into account the decision making process and the therapeutic habits of the related obstetrical centre. It will however require regular updating.

AB  - Temperature dependence of thermal diffusion factor, αT, of N2-CO (1: 1) gas mixture can be assessed from the measurement of the equilibrium steady state separation factor, qe as a function or pressure at 350.1, 378.5 and 413.5 K by a concentric tube type hot wall thermal diffiusion column already calibrated by a gas mixture of known and reliable αT data. Too much attention to the column geometry is, thus, avoided through the use of the existing theoretical formulations for column in calculating αT. © 1981, THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

AB  - The corrosion of concentric neutral wires on underground electric cables has been recognized as a critical problem over the past several years. It is only recently, however, that the extent of the problem has come to the attention of the electric power industry. The bare concentric neutral wires which surround a direct-burial power cable provide protection for other underground utility structures buried in the same trench and for public safety in the event of cable damage during excavations. The integrity of the concentric neutral wires is therefore of the utmost importance. Many mechanisms may contribute to the corrosion of concentric neutral wires provided with an alloy coating, but direct attack from the environment predominates. Close spaced potential profiles provide an excellent means of evaluating corrosion activity along a URD system. Empirical evidence indicates that active corrosion is occurring on concentric neutral wires when the potential-to-earth is minus 150 millivolts or more positive, and may be a problem in the range of minus 150 to minus 250 millivolts. Cathodic protection in the form of magnesium anodes provides an economical means of corrosion control on URD cable. Initial magnesium anode installations indicate that protective current will polarize the concentric neutral wires.

AB  - The embryonic development of Tarantula marginemaculata can be devided into two phases. Cleavage, germ layer formation, and formation of the body form take place during the protembryonic phase which takes about 20 days and ends with an embryonic moult and rupture of the egg shell. During the following 70 to 80 days (the deutembryonic phase) organogenesis and histogenesis take place, and finally a prenymph emerges from the brood pouch. Cleavage is superficial and ends with yolk contraction. A small germ band is formed by aggregations of cells and a blastopore area appears in its centre. Germ layer formation is achieved by immigration of cells from the blastopore area. The germ band enlarges, and in front of the blastopore area a number of concentric quarter-circular thickenings appear, representing the rudiments of the prosomal segments. At the same time, the cumulus separates from the germ band and migrates towards the future dorsal side. The opisthosomal segments are later formed by proliferation from the caudal lobe. The rudiments of the prosomal segments soon become more distinct and narrower. Later, each is devided into two halves which, during reversion, separate and migrate to lateral positions. Reversion is similar to that of mygalomorph and haplogyn spiders. The cumulus migrates along the dorsal midline nearly towards the front end of the embryo and finally desintegrates by forming yolk cells which participate in the formation of the anterior mid gut rudiment. Seven pairs of coelomic cavities are formed within the prosoma and 12 within the opisthosoma. The formation of dorsal and ventral diaphragma, heart, endosternite, musculatur etc. is described and the significance of the ventral diaphragma and endosternite is discussed. The first pair of coelomic cavities, the precheliceral coelom, underlies the head lobes and later supplies the labrum (rostrum) and stomodaeum and forms the aorta anterior and the arteriae crassae. This coelom is most likely homologous to the preantennulary coelom of many mandibulates. It is the only indication of a precheliceral segment which has been lost or fused with the acron. The most conspicuous characters of the amblypygid brain are huge globuli-cell masses covering the entire brain, and glomeruli in the first leg ganglia. A well developed stomodeal bridge is present, giving rise to an unpaired rostral nerve and perhaps paired lateral nerves also. Development of the central nervous system involves many small invaginations. The brain is formed from the large precheliceral lead lobes which are later devided into the median part and lateral vesicles. Most of the brain, including central body, corpora pedunculata, and median optic masses, are formed by the median part of the head lobes. The lateral vesicles give rise to the optic masses of the lateral eyes and part of the optic centre. These and other structures can hardly be regarded as precheliceral segmental neuromeres. The lateral vesicles may be homologous to the optic lobes of the Mandibulata. The neuromeres of hypothetical precheliceral segments (prosocephalon, deutocephalon) have either been completely lost or completely fused to the archicerebrum, or the prosocerebrum is represented by the rostral ganglia. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This note describes the construction of a probe comprising two concentric tubes; the inner tube carries the search gas to the region of the suspected leak, whilst the excess is removed by means of a small extractor pump connected to the outer tube. By this means contamination of the test area by search gas is avoided, and spurious indications arising from permeation of search gases such as helium through the walls of glass apparatus are greatly reduced.

AB  - Control of seed‐borne Septoria nodorum on winter wheat by seed treatment with one of two organomercury compounds at various rates, or with carboxin, maneb, guazatine, quinacetol sulphate or thiabendazole, was investigated in two field experiments in eastern England during 1973–75 and in growth‐room tests. All the non‐mercurial fungicides were as effective as the optimum rates of organomercury compounds in preventing seedling infection. Subsequent development of S. nodorum on the upper leaves, and of mildew, sharp eyespot and eyespot, was not influenced by seed treatment. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Long‐term experiments show that monoculturing cereals will lead to yield depletion. The two main factors responsible for this loss are take‐all (Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) v. Arx & Olivier) and eyespot (Cercosporella herpotrichoides Fron). Of less importance is the cereal cyst nematode since Danish breeders produced new barley varieties that are highly resistant against this nematode. These parasites, however, do not account for all the losses occurring and other yield decreasing factors must be present, the nature of which remains to be revealed. Experiments with barley grown in monoculture show that the yield, although declining steadily the first 2–4 years, remains stable after that, whereas take‐all declines. Adding straw to the soil or burning it has little effect on yield or diseases. The same is true for post‐harvest soil treatments. It is expected that post‐harvest crops such as Italian ryegrass and white mustard do have a beneficial effect and their value, especially as crops that can be sown after harvest, is being investigated. Breeding for resistance against take‐all is cumbersome and of doubtful economical value. Chemical control of take‐all is not feasible, but eyespot can be controlled efficiently with Benomyl. Long‐term experiments show that continuous cereal growing may result in yield decrease. In barley, which is dominating in Denmark, the decrease on fertile soils is usually of minor importance. Experiments have further shown that the biggest yield decrease occurs in the 3rd to 5th year of barley monoculture. The influence of different treatments of straw on yield and diseases has been insignificant according to experiments carried out during 7 years on 4 experimental stations. Post‐harvest soil treatment has very little effect on diseases and yield except on land heavily infested with weeds. Post‐harvest crops such as Italian ryegrass and white mustard are of great interest and their value is further investigated, especially as crops sown after harvest. The cereal root nematode is still a threat to the growing of oat and spring wheat. High yielding barley varieties which are resistant to the 2 pathotypes occurring in Denmark are a useful tool in reducing the risk inherent in continuous barley growing. Decline in the population of nematodes has been observed when using monocultures of different host‐plants. Resistance against take‐all (G. graminis) is thoroughly investigated in Denmark. The conclusion is that breeding for resistance is very difficult and of doubtful economical value. Chemical control of take‐all in the field seems to be impossible in contrast to the good results obtained when testing several chemicals in the laboratory. The control of eyespot (C. herpotrichoides) with Benomyl has been highly successful in winter wheat and winter rye in some experiments, but an economical use demands a rather safe method of forecasting attacks in the different fields. The problem of take‐all decline and yield stabilization by continuous cereal growing has attracted the interest of many research workers. In Denmark we have tried to investigate this phenomenon in different soil types placed under the same climatic conditions. The importance of take‐all as the most serious pathogen in barley monoculture is doubtful according to our experience gained from thousands of observations. We are therefore investigating intensively which factors could possibly be held responsible for the clearly noticeable reduction in yield. Copyright © 1975, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Members of the genus Chorda represent the simplest form of sporophyte in the order Laminariales. The present study deals with reproduction in Chorda tomentosa, involving the initiation, growth, and structure of the sporangium and the process of zoosporogenesis. The simple tube‐like sporophyte of Chorda tomentosa grows in diameter by means of repeated anticlinal divisions in a superficial meristematic layer known as the meristoderm. The onset of reproduction is marked by the conversion of the meristoderm from contributing cells to the vegetative plant body to producing 2 new cell types: paraphyses and sporangial mother cells. At the time of initiation, sporangial mother cells are crescent shaped and possess a densely staining cytoplasm. Sporangial mother cells increase in size, become ellipsoid, decrease in staining density, and undergo meiosis. After meiosis, sporangia increase in size while their nuclei undergo successive cycles of synchronous mitotic divisions. Sporangia increase to a maximum length of 120 μ;m at which time they possess the characteristic “cap” found in all members of the order studied thus far. At this stage the protoplast of the sporangium is organized into a peripheral layer of nucleus‐chloroplast pairs and a central region of vacuoles. Cleavage furrows begin to form at the cell membrane and are met by furrows developing in the interior of the cytoplasm resulting in the division of the entire protoplast into separate units. Each unit is an individual zoospore. The biflagellate zoospores contain a nucleus, one chloroplast with eyespot, perinuclear Golgi, and several bodies of presumed storage carbohydrate. The occurrence of a small population of early developing sporangia is described. In essential details, the origin, development, and structure of sporangia in Chorda tomentosa are identical to all earlier observations in the Laminariales. Copyright © 1974, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - n-type single crystals of lead sulfide, PbS, have been grown by a novel chemical vapor deposition method of potential importance for growing a variety of chalcogenide crystals. A reduced-pressure flowing system was developed based on the following chemical reactions: Pb+Cl2→PbCl2 and PbCl2+H2S→PbS+2HCl. Additional Cl2 is used for fine control of the growth rate. The optimal growth conditions are a temperature of 650 to 750°C and a pressure of 8 Torr. Important to the furnace design is a quartz concentric gas injection arrangement which prevents premature mixing and reacting of the gases. n-type single crystals of PbS having carrier concentrations of the order of 1019 cm-3 and Hall mobilities of 600 cm2/V sec at 300°K and as high as 14 000 cm2/V sec at 77°K have been grown. An isothermal anneal at 850°C for 15 days will convert the crystals to p type. Possible extensions of the technique to mixed lead-tin salts, including tellurides and selenides, and to other chalcogenides are discussed. © 1974 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - A gas discharge tube for transmit-receive switching capable of handling average power levels up to at least 25 kw at 3000 Mc is described. The discharge is excited in the annular space between two concentric silica tubes and recovery time is controlled by the dimensions and gas pressure. In this way, a tube with constant characteristics during life has been achieved. The tube is mounted in a thick resonant iris, and sparking is avoided by using accurately ground silica mounted in a precision-bore hole. The arc loss of the tube in this form of mount is less than 0.1 db at 5 Mw peak 10 kw average, and the recovery time is about 100 μsec to 3 db. The attenuation is about 30 db, and the insertion loss is less than 0.1 db. Performance of this form of tube is discussed for average power levels of up to 50 kw in a phase-shift duplexer and 25 kw in a balanced duplexer, and the expected performance during life is also considered. Lives in excess of 10,000 hours are deduced from extrapolated data obtained with radioactive krypton in tubes operating at 10 kw average. COPYRIGHT ©l960—THE INSTITUTE OF RADIO ENGINEERS, INC.

AB  - The life cycle of Catatropis indicaSrivastava, 1935, is described. Sporocysts, daughter and mother rediae, and cercariae were found in the intermediate host Bithynia (Digoniostoma) sp. The size of the rediae and cercariae depends on the intensity of infection. The cercariae have a long tail, 3 eyespots and 1 pair of posterior 'perivesicular vesicles' which bring about adhesion to the substratum of the posterior part of the body during encystment. Metacercariae are formed outside the snail. Experimental final hosts are chickens and ducks. Older worms are limited to the caeca. In chickens, the first eggs appear in the faeces 10-12 days p.i. The worms reach their full size about 30 days p.i. The eggs have usually 2 and occasionally more long polar filaments. There are no free miracidia. © 1967 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Dredge hauls of fresh submarine basalt collected from the axis of the Reykjanes Ridge (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) south of Iceland were taken aboard R/ V TRIDENT in 1967 and 1971. The samples show systematic changes as the water depth of collection (and eruption) decreases: radially elongate vesicles and concentric zones of vesicles appear at about 700 m depth and are conspicuous to shallow water; the smoothed volume percent of vesicles increases from 5% at 1000 m, 10% at 700 m, to 16% at 500 m, and the scatter in degree of vesicularity increases in shallower water; specific gravity decreases from 2.7±0.1 at 1000 m to 2.3±0.3 at 100 m. Bulk sulfur content for the outer 2 cm averages 843 ppm up to a depth of 200 m, then drops off rapidly in shallower water owing to degassing. Sulfur content below 200 m is independent of depth (or geographic position), and the melt is apparently saturated with sulfur, but the excess cannot escape the lava unless another vehicle carries it out. Only shallower than 200 m, where intense vesiculation of other gases occurs can excess sulfur be lost from the lava erupting on the sea floor. H2O+110° averages about 0.35 percent and H2O+150° about 0.25 percent, and both apparently decrease in water shallower than 200 m as a result of degassing. H2O+ (below 200 m) decreases with distance from Iceland or increasing depth, presumably as a result of either adsorption of water on the surface of shallower, more vesicular rocks; or more likely due to the presence of the Iceland hot mantle plume supplying undifferentiated primordial material, relative to lavas of the Reykjanes Ridge supplied from the low velocity layer already depleted in volatiles and large lithophile elements. The H2O+110°/S ratio of lava erupting below 200 m water depth ranges from 3 to 5 which is comparable to reliable gas analyses from oceanic basaltic volcanoes. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A new concept (the annular field optical system) makes it possible to avoid the extreme complexity of conventional projection mask alignment objectives. This was realized in a new, simple, all-reflecting optical system that consists of two, concentric, spherical mirrors. A monolithic block consisting of three mutually perpendicular plane mirrors is used to fold the system into a configuration that makes possible an inherently synchronous, simple scanning arrangement. Partially coherent illumination is used to increase the effective MTF without decreasing the depth of focus.

AB  - A method of arc welding, using natural gas and oxygen as a protective atmosphere, developed at the Lvov Polytechnic Institute, is described. The welding zone is protected by outer annular flow of natural gas. Oxygen is fed concentrically inside the flow. The outer flow of natural gas prevents penetration of air nitrogen into the welding zone, and the harmful effect of natural gas, that may cause porosity, is suppressed by the inner flow of oxygen.

AB  - A correlative cytological and histochemical study has been made of oogenesis in birds (pigeon, Columba livia; brown dove, Streptopelia senegalensis; ring dove, S. dacaocto; domestic fowl, Gallus domesticus; and quail, Coturnix coturnix). Balbiani's vitelline body consisting of large yolk nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi bodies and lipid bodies of variable composition is gradually developed in the juxtanuclear cytoplasm of their young oocytes. Histochemical tests indicate that the yolk nucleus consists mainly of RNA, protein and lipoprotein. During early vitellogenesis, the yolk vesicles are formed in the central ooplasm by the activity of ooplasmic structures especially the chromophilic and argentophilic elements. They are ultimately transformed into yolk bodies of variable morphology and chemical composition, which are arrayed in alternating concentric spheres (yellow and white) and consist of protein, lipoprotein, triglycerides, carbohydrates, RNA, etc.

AB  - The known requirements for the sorption and swelling of wood are reviewed. These are shown to be compatible, in the case of softwoods, with the following simplified model. The fibers are continuous with either rectangular or circular cross sections and lumen of the same shape with a constant size. The fiber walls consist of concentric lamina made up of small repeating units 100 Å by 100 Å, consisting of a microcrystalline core surrounded by an amorphous sheath. All sorption and swelling occurs at the surfaces of or within the amorphous sheath. The major portion of the sorption and swelling is inter-laminar with just sufficient intra-laminar sorption and swelling to avoid laminar distortion. Calculations give the generally accepted internal sorption surface for water of about 200 square meters per gram. The portion of the total sorption that is intra-laminar varies from 5 ... 20 percent in going from wood with a specific gravity of 0.3 ... 1.0. Thickness of sorption in water molecules per sorption site vary from 6.1 ... 4.9 for inter-laminar sorption and 0.35 ... 1.35 for intra-laminar sorption in going from wood with a specific gravity of 0.3 to one of 1.0. Similar values are obtained from experimental swelling data where lumen cross sections change. Similar calculations for super swelling of wood and pulps show that laminar separations may become sufficiently great to be microscopically visible. The calculations show that bound water fiber saturation points for wood normally fall in the range of 25 ... 40 percent. Super swollen wood, chemically isolated fibers and beaten fibers may as a result of reduced restraints have fiber saturation points greater than 150 percent. The latter are attributed to dispersion or diffusion forces rather than the conventional bound water forces of hydrogen bonding for intact wood. © 1969 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The hydrochloric-acid spent pickle liquor at Armco Steel Corp's new Middletown, Ohio, operation was disposed of by pumping into wells 2950 ft deep, ending above the basement rock, and below an impervious layer which prevents the waste from contaminating the ground-water above. Three concentric casings are used, and the space outside the outer two was concreted. The annular space around the injection pipe was filled with oil and pressured with nitrogen gas at slightly higher pressure than in the injection tubing.

AB  - A new ultra-high voltage planar device structure has been developed and applied to transistors and gate controlled switches. Conventional concentric ring junctions on the top surface of a substrate can prevent the surface breakdown of planar junctions, but not the bulk breakdown. By introducing concentric ring junctions of the bottom surface of the substrate and properly choosing the spacing between the main junction and the ring junction, the bulk breakdown of the main planar junction can be also avoided. Then breakdown occurs not at the main junction, but at the most exterior ring junction. Consequently the breakdown voltage increases as the number of rings increases and can be infinite in principle.

AB  - Under certain conditions, sharp tapping to the metasternum and anterior abdominal sternites causes both sexes of the normally procryptic Australian stick insect Eurycnema goliath (Gray) to face the source of disturbance and to display the vivid red undersurfaces of the remigia of the wings, and tegmina and a pair of eye-like spots on the metacoxae. Then the metathoracic legs are rapidly struck togethe once or a number of times, each strike being accompanied by a swishing sound apparently produced by wing movement. A somewhat similar reaction was noted in a female of the stick insect Tropidoderus childrenii (Gray) which has no red. It is suggested that this reaction is defensive, enabling the insect sometimes to bluff predators by undergoing a sudden transformation from a procryptic appearance to a startling pseudoaposematic one. © 1966.

AB  - The dynamic viscosity η′ and rigidity G′ of polystyrene and polypropylene in molten states have been measured by means of a concentric cylinder-type rheometer in the frequency range of about 0.001 to 0.5 cps at different temperatures, in order to study the effect of blending on the properties of these substances. The frequency dependence curves of η′ and G′ at different temperatures can be superposed well according to the usual time-temperature superposition principle without correction for temperature and density. The viscosity data for the polystyrene blends in a wide range of frequency show that the viscosity curves for these blends, differing in their molecular weights from each other, join together at the angular frequencies (ω) higher than about 300, while the rigidity curves for the blends show much difference even at ω=300. This suggests that as a means to distinguish polymers measuring their viscosity alone is not adequate. So far as the range of ω is not so high, log (η′/η0) (η0=zero-frequency viscosity) vs. log ω curves for the blends of two components differing only in molecular weight can be superposed into a master curve by shifting the curves for the blends having compositions differing from each other in the horizontal direction by log aM. On the other hand, log G′ vs. log ω curves can be superposed by shifting them first horizontally by log aM and then vertically by log cM. The shift factors aM and cM depend not only upon the molecular weight but also upon the molecular weight distribution of the blend. When molecular weight variation of the two components is small, log aM and log cM bear straight-line relationship between log(η02/η0b), where η02 and η0b are respectively the zero-frequency viscosity for the component chosen as the standard and the blends. In the case of polyethylene studied previously2), log cM was zero independent of the composition, and hence the slope of log aM vs. log (η02/η0b) curve was zero. However, in the case of the blends of polystyrene and polypropylene studied here, where the molecular weight variatian of the two components is conspicuously large, the slope of similar straight lines becomes larger. The slopes of the straight lines for log aM and log cM plotted against log (η02/η0b) depend upon the difference between the molecular weights of the two components. Moreover, there can be found the following relation between aM and cM both experimentally and theoretically: cM/aM=η02/η0b. © 1966, The Society of Materials Science, Japan. All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuous "loculose" organic structure in "cones" and "caps" of the avian egg shell (the "mamillary cores" of the English literature), was thoroughly investigated in the Nandu (Rhea americana) as well as in the duck (Anas domestica) by means of etched cross-ground sections, impregnated with gold (see page 195). This procedure shows the loculi in grey-blue or violet-blue, the shell membrane fibres in brown or wine-red, and the caps in a mixed colour of both. Each loculus envelops a single calcite crystal. The greatest thickness of the organic septa is found in the crystallization centre of the calospherites; therefore the impregnation is sometimes so strong, that they have an opaque appearance. The loculi of the cones vanish gradually towards the columnar layer. The radial differentiation and the concentric striation of the loculi in the cones as well as their behaviour in the primary spherites are described in detail. In the caps the loculi separate not only neighbouring crystals, they also limite the crystals towards the shell membrane fibres, which interlace the cap. The loculi originate from the organic part of the shell-forming secretion, which remains there after the individual calcite crystals have fallen out; in a kind of "self-purification" process, the outgrowing crystals press the organic material into the gaps beetwen them, where its hardens. © 1965 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to reveal the fracture process of the single coniferous tracheids under tensile stress and the mechanical behaviour of two kinds of bordered pit, i.e. the cross field pit and the intertracheal pit. The early and latewood single tracheids prepared from the delignified wood chips of SUGI (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) were freeze-dried, and mounted on the specimen tabs. The single tracheids were stretched after setting on the tensile device. The behaviour of the single tracheid in stretching within the SEM column was observed with a monitor television and recorded on a video tape recorder. Furthermore, the broken ends of the single tracheids were investigated in detail using the SEM. The results obtained from these observations are as follows; The initial crack of the single tracheid almost always took place at the cross field pit near the end of ray crossing (Figs. 3-2, 5-1, 6-2 and 7). In earlywood tracheids, the initial crack propagated across the cell wall of the ray crossing, accompanying a twist around the cell axis (Fig.3-2). The broken end of fractured S2 layer caused by the initial crack propagation showed the minute splintery mode, indicated by an arrow in Fig. 5-2, because the S2 microfibrils should have been severed with some slippage among them. Furthermore, the crack sometimes propagated longitudinally along the cell corner (Fig. 4). The initial crack of the latewood tracheid propagated almost perpendicular to the cell axis, and the initially fractured surface of the S2 layer was very smooth (Fig. 7). In both the early and latewood single tracheids, the fractured wall occurred at the final stage of fracture process showed conspicuously the long splintery mode (Figs. 3-6 and 6-4), indicating the intermicrofibril slippage. The initial crack scarcely occurred at the intertracheal bordered pit. In earlywood tracheids, the intertracheal pit makes resistance to crack propagation in the cell wall, and so the crack ran around the pit margin (Fig. 10). In latewood tracheids, the pit border split along the S2 microfibril orientation, but the layer in which the microfibrils oriented concentrically was unbroken (Fig. 11). © 1975, The Society of Materials Science, Japan.

AB  - To evaluate the potential efficacy of fungicides for the control of birds' eye spot in rubber nurseries, 49 formulations were tested in the laboratory by the paper disc diffusion and liquid culture methods. After discarding phytotoxic fungicides, only certain of the carbamate compounds, especially thiram, and those containing manganese and difolatan showed mazked activity in both series of tests. The results were compazed with field experience, and for the most part good correlations were found between laboratory and field results, a marked exception being the poor in vitro inhibition shown by zineb. A bimodal growth response was shown by the fungus to some of the carbamate formulations. © 1969, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper focuses primarily on the corrosion of copper in soil environments, describing the mechanism by which copper corrodes and defining the circumstances under which accelerated attack may be anticipated. The corrosion of concentric neutral wires is discussed in particular. It is concluded that underground copper corrosion can be anticipated in the soil contaminated by street salts, fertilizers, or decaying organic matter. Corrosion of tinned concentric neutral wires can be explained by the absence of anodic polarization on the copper service.

AB  - An activated-sludge treatment plant in Camden, N. Y. has several innovations: the principal one is the use of concentric tanks - as distinct from the usual way of having separate, isolated tanks. There are three concentric tanks: the inner tank is the final settling basin; and the two outer tanks are aeration tanks, stirred by Passavant brush aerators. Using concentric tanks allowed the engineers to get the 0. 8 mgd plant into a small area. Another unusual feature: the inner, final settling tank is covered with a geodesic dome, to prevent freezing of sewage during wintertime. The way effluent leaving the plant is chlorinated for disinfection.

AB  - The problem of steady, laminar natural convection between horizontal concentric circular cylinders was attacked numerically via detailed difference equation approximations for the differential equations of conservation. No terms were eliminated by boundary layer arguments. The problem was solved with machine language on an IBM 650 digital computer for several diameter ratios and several Grashof numbers at a Prandtl number of 0.714. Computed results agree well with experiments reported in the literature. In the appropriate limiting case, the computed results also accord with an analytical derivation for creeping flow. © 1962, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - A very simple formula is derived for the self-similarity exponent for a convergent concentric shock wave in gas. The agreement with the accurate solution is very good, the error being below 5%. The formula obtained enables the author to avoid the tedious procedure of determining the self-similarity exponent by solving a boundary value problem for a complicated set of nonlinear equations. The present method is based on the analogy with the plane wave problem in a nonhomogeneous body of decreasing density.

AB  - Surgical treatment of coarctation of the aorta in the newborn often recurs during childhood. As a means of avoiding this complication segmental replacement of the thoracic aorta with autologous pericardium was evaluated. The isthmic aorta of seven mongrel puppies was replaced by a tubular live pericardial autograft. Between 5 and 36 months (average 15) after surgery, the status of the graft was evaluated by hemodynamic, angiographic, macroscopical and histological studies. Growth of the graft was appreciated by comparing its diameter to that of the descending aorta DG/DA. No pressure gradient across the graft was noted. No significant structure of the graft was observed. The internal surface of the graft was smooth, and the wall, slightly thinner than that of the aorta showed no aneurysm. The diameter of the graft was increased (DG mean 37 %) proportionally to the increase of the aorta (DA mean 36 %). Histologically the graft was endothelialized, the wall was thickened and made up of concentric collagen fibers, live fibroblasts and muscular cells. These results show that during the first months of life, the isthmus of the aorta can be replaced by an autologous pericardial graft which will follow the growth of the normal aorta and adapt to its hemodynamic regimen.

AB  - A design of pot shaped or rolling diaphragm made of an elastomeric material with reinforcing plies is described. The diaphragm has a flat base supported against a rigid disc and has several concentric grooves in the base. The grooves provide manufacturing advantages in preventing the creasing of the reinforcing plies during moulding. Additional grooves can be provided if required in the corner region of the diaphragm which is subjected to higher bending stress. (8 claims:2 figs.) (R.M.A.)

AB  - This report attempts to synthesize the results of recent geologic mapping and petrologic studies in western Maine, an area that lies on the transition zone between the sillimanitic portion of the Merrimack synclinorium in New Hampshire and the greenschist-facies portion in central Maine. Results of two fundamentally different deformations are recognized in the transition zone. The first or early deformation produced northeast-trending tight, upright passive-flow folds; longitudinal premetamorphic faults of large displacement; and slaty cleavage formed also by the first metamorphism (M-l). These features were produced throughout the whole geosyncline that was ancestral to the Merrimack synclinorium; they characterize the structure of the greenschist terrane. But southwestward across the transition zone, they are increasingly blurred by younger superposed structural and metamorphic features. Inferred origins are geosynclinally controlled slump deformation and tectonic dewatering culminating in low-grade metamorphism. The younger features collectively define the late deformation and at least two late metamorphic events (M-2 and M-3). The late deformation produced a complex pattern of slip cleavages; schistosity derived from slip cleavage, small recumbent folds, large flexural folds, and domes of varied shapes and trends; and conspicuous northwest-trending flexural cross folds. In the northeast part of the transition zone, M-2 and M-3 metamorphic events produced overlapping metamorphic zones approximately concentric to granitic plutons. To the southwest, where metamorphic grade is regionally in the sillimanite or potassium feldspar plus sillimanite zones, M-2 and M-3 zones coalesce and become indistinguishable. Many structural features are directly magma-generated, but the northwest-trending cross folds and related cleavages probably express regional strain that is only temporally magma-related. Nine samples of granite and aplite have yielded an isotopic age of 379 ± 6 m.y. by the Rb-Sr whole-rock method. This age dates the youngest intrusive rocks of the New Hampshire Plutonic Series in the report area, M-3 metamorphism, and the late deformations that accompanied M-3. Because all the plutons intrude previously deformed Devonian and older strata, the isotopic age narrowly restricts the duration of the early and late deformations, plutonism, and M-l to M-3 metamorphisms. We speculate that the Mooselookmeguntic pluton and the larger Sebago pluton farther south are irregular but broadly arched subhorizontal sheets only a few kilometres thick that were emplaced at depths of 11 to 15 km. The transition zone is where these and possibly other sheetlike bodies dive monoclinelike to the northeast. Northeast of the transition zone, the tops of the sheets are now a few kilometres below the surface. Associated with them are many of the late structural and metamorphic features that characterize the transition zone and the sillimanite terrane. Above them is a partly eroded thick slate layer. Numerous plutons now exposed northeast of the transition zone are cupolas and possibly isolated bodies that rose above the sheets. In the sillimanite terrane southwest of the transition zone, a subhorizontal granitic sheet complex is exposed. The thick slate layer that is now exposed only in the northeast once extended over the sillimanite terrane.

AB  - A simple formula is derived for the self-similarity exponent for concentric shock waves in a nonhomogeneous medium with a density decreasing towards the center. The solution is constructed by correlating the solution for the plane wave in a nonhomogeneous body wih the quasi-nonhomogeneity for the concentric wave, as interpreted in the quasi-plane model. The solution obtained enabled the author to avoid complicated numerical integration for the boundary-value problem of a nonlinear set of differential equations, the relative error being of a few per cent.

AB  - The deformation is considered which occurs when a long hollow cylinder of silicon carbide surrounded by a concentric cylinder of uranium is cooled under pressure. To avoid collapse of such a cylinder its dimensions must be suitably chosen and so maximum values of the inner radius of the silicon carbide tube are calculated for various values of the other radii, the temperatures and the maximum stress permissible in the ceramic. If the silicon carbide is replaced by graphite and the cylinders cooled through more than 50°C, no value of the inner radius could be found for which the compressive stress was less than the maximum permissible value. © 1962.

AB  - Axisymmetric motions of a circular elastic plate are considered here according to the Poisson-Kirchhoff plate theory. A concentric ring loading of arbitrary time dependence is examined and used to construct solutions for a concentrated central load and for a uniform pressure loading. The boundary of the plate is considered to be elastically built-in in a manner that prevents transverse edge motion and provides a restoring edge moment linearly related to edge rotation. Thus, limiting cases are a clamped plate and a simply supported plate. Finally, a discussion relating this work to the integraltransform approach of Sneddon is presented to enable physical interpretation and generalization of his approach. © 1965 by ASME.

AB  - The "cones" and "columns" of the swans egg shell leave behind after decalcification with EDTA an organic (mucoproteid) material in form of a continuous frame work stainable metachromatically with thionine. Without demineralisation or at least etching, thionine proves ineffectual in ground sections or breaking edges of the shell. In ground sections the light microscope demonstrates nothing of the organic material: it was inclosed during the crystal growth in submicroscopical lattice gaps of the calcite individuals. The organic material is chiefly accumulated in the outer and inner surfaces of the crystals. In the "cones" the organic frame work is developed radially as the "loculi" of the "wedges" and concentrically layered corresponding with the globular inclusions, concentrated in the circumference of each. In the "inner columns" the organic material follows to the rhomb pattern. The "outer columns" after decalcification only leave behind a thin lateral organic sheath. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The smallest length of pelagic larvae of E. bifrons reared from fertilized eggs (mean diameter 119-6 μηί) was 150 μτα. Shell growth revealed insignificant umbone development, and the length-width relationship is described by the geometric mean regression: W = 0-751/+ 20-720. Eye spots were conspicuous and common in larvae of 165-175 μηί length; metamorphosis generally occurred when larvae were just longer than 200 μπ\. In cultures maintained between 14 and 18”C juveniles were present 17-20 days after fertilization. Provinicular structure was simple, and there were generally four teeth at each end of the hinge. Unisexuality, the large size of eggs and early larvae, shorter larval life, and the lack of umhone development are the most significant characteristics distinguishing the development of E. bifrons from that of Pecten meridionalis, another local pectinid. © 1976 CSIRO.

AB  - A peritrophic membrane formed in the posterior midgut of female simuliids of seven species within 30 min of feeding on blood of various avian or mammalian hosts, and 6–12 hr thereafter it displayed up to seven concentric laminae. Within the first 48 hr of blood digestion, the posterior part of the peritrophic membrane (where digestion was most advanced) began to decompose and PM disappearance was complete at the end of blood digestion. In different species blood digestion at 18°‐20° required 120–180 hr which was increased to over 200 hr by microsporidan infection. If a blood‐sucrose mixture went directly to the midgut, a thin membrane formed around it, but not if it went indirectly by way of the crop. A “prefeeding secretion” in the anterior midgut is considered to be the peritrophic membrane of the pharate adult surrounding a small, but variable, amount of material, the meconium. LA MEMBRANE PERITROPHIQUE DES ADULTES DE SIMULIES AVANT ET APRES ALIMENTATION DE SANG OU DE MELANGES SANG‐SUCROSE Sept espèces de simulies ont été étudiées: 5 ornithophiles, 2 mammalophiles. Trente minutes après un repas de sang sur divers oiseaux (poulet, canard) ou mammifères (homme, cerf, élan d'Amérique) on constate qu'une membrane péritrophique est sécrétée par toute le surface épithéliale dans la région moyenne de l'intestin moyen postérieur dilaté des femelles. Six à douze heures après le repas cette membrane comporte jusqu'à sept lamelles concentriques. Une sécrétion moins importante se forme autour de la petite quantité de sang que l'on trouve dans l'estomac antérieur, non dilaté et étroit; cette sécrétion glisse vers l'arrière et forme une capsule recouvrant le pǒle antérieur du bol alimentaire sanguin dans la partie postérieure de l'intestin moyen, ceci pendant le premier jour. La digestion commence à la périphérie et à l'extrémité postérieure de la masse sanguine et se poursuit enfin à l'extrémité antérieure, où la membrane péritrophique conserve le plus longtemps sa structure en contact avec le sang non digéré. Dans les premières 48 heures de la digestion du sang, la région postértieure de la membrane péritrophique (là où la digestion est la plus avancée) commence à se décomposer, et sa disparition est complète quand la digestion du sang est achevée. Chez les différentes espèces étudiées, la digestion du sang à 18–20° exige 120–180 heures, pouvant demander plus de 200 heures chez des insectes atteints d'une infection par des microsporidies. Si un mélange de sang et sucrose parvient directement dans la région moyenne de l'intestin moyen, une membrane mince se forme autour, mais non si cet aliment passe par le jabot. Une sécrétion précédant l'alimentation s'observe dans l'intestin moyen antérieur des mouches non nourries et doit représenter, chez l'adulte venant d'éclore, la membrane péritrophique entourant le méconium: petite quantité de matière d'importance variable. Cette matière se retrouve souvent au centre de la masse sanguine après alimentation et est lente à digérer. 1977 The Netherlands Entomological Society

AB  - Plastic-clad silica fibers resist ionizing radiation much better than all-glass fibers. This makes them attractive for cables in military avionics and satellites. But these fibers have one singular drawback - they're very hard to terminate, although not impossible. Their silicone cladding doesn't bond well to the epoxy used for potting the fibers in a connector, so thermal and mechanical stresses can break the bond rather easily. When the fibers are being terminated, the silicone is too soft to support the cores. It lets them bend back and forth during polishing, often making the cores chip and break. At best, the cores become polished with slightly convex ends. The silicone cladding, used by nearly all manufacturers of plastic-clad silica fibers is unusually thick in relation to the core, while the core isn't generally concentric with the cladding. When these fibers are joined by pluggable cable-to-cable connectors, typical losses are unacceptably high. Since the cladding positions in cores, the cores of one cable usually fail to line up with the cores in the other cable, so little light gets transferred. The solution is to remove the silicone cladding from the ends of a fiber and substitute a thin layer of a fluorine-based copolymer, which is much harder than silicone and has a sufficiently low refractive index to preserve the numerical aperture of the fiber, so as to avoid any significant extra losses. Also, the copolymer bonds well to the silica core and, in turn, the potting epoxy adheres well to the copolymer.

AB  - The external shapes of tri-pyramid defects are summarized and typical shapes, deviations from the typical, and the interactions between tri-pyramids and stacking faults are described. Two basic types of typical tri-pyramids were observed, one with a single peak, and the other with three peaks. The symmetry of the typical tri-pyramids is three-fold. The angle between the apexes of the three pyramids composing the tri-pyramid is 120 °. Each of the pyramids composing the tri-pyramid is a single crystal but with crystallographic orientation different from that of the rest of the layer. The deviations consist of amputated tri-pyramids, bi-pyramids and mono-pyramids, none of which are symmetrical. The layer surface nearest the tri-pyramid is not planar, but distorted. Dash etch was used to reveal stacking faults interacting concentrically with typical tri-pyramids. The dimensions of the tri-pyramid and the stacking fault are proportional to the epitaxial layer thickness. Photographs of interactions among tri-pyramids and stacking faults are obtained by using S.E.M. to obtain high resolution, which reveals finer details in higher magnifications. Traces of SiC or SiO2 or other foreign materials, together with some basic mechanism, are probably responsible for tri-pyramid formation. They can be prevented by proper treatment of the silicon substrate prior to the layer growth. © 1979 Pergamon Press Ltd.

Several groups are working on how to spot and prevent this corrosion. Six short papers by different authors discuss this problem and describe laboratory tests and field measurements. It is concluded that more specific data is needed.

AB  - Greater prairie chickens are social birds in which males gather and perform a group display on a mating area during the spring. On these mating areas (booming grounds) male birds establish territories. This study was initiated to determine the relationship between booming territory size and mating success of individual birds. Observations were made during fifty-three mornings at one booming ground in northeastern Kansas during 1964 and 1965. Exact locations for eight tagged males were determined at 15 min intervals during the period of study. From these location data, territories were determined for each marked male with concentric rings drawn to delineate areas of more intensive bird activity. Sixty-nine copulations were tabulated as a measure of mating success. Two males, both of which controlled large booming ground territories, accounted for 72·5 per cent of the matings observed during this study period. The size of the inner portion of the territory and the total territory size appear to be directly related to mating success in booming populations of greater prairie chickens. © 1966.

AB  - The divisive information analysis was used for the hierarchical classifications of faunal areas and faunal elements of Australia from the distribution of 464 species of land birds at 121 selected sites. The faunal areas are delimited from the classification of the sites in terms of the distributions of species, superspecies, genera, and polytypic genera, separately. For the classification of faunal elements only species groups and genera groups were used. The derived faunal areas produced concentric zonation showing remarkable resemblances to the faunal subdivisions proposed by earlier workers who used intuitive methods for the classification. This demonstrates empirically the applicability of the numerical method to zoogeography. Comparison between the species pattern and the genera pattern of distribution suggests the Kimberley line as the oldest barrier separating the central fauna from the northern fauna. This is followed by the barriers separating the faunas of Tasmania, the south-west, and the north-east respectively, in order of increasing recency. In the distribution of species, new terms of reference are proposed to denote the faunal areas and the species groups characterizing the areas. © 1969, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - The populations of Spilonota ocellana (D.&S.) on two cultivars in an insecticide free orchard showed nearly identical trends over a 12-year period. Egg populations reached maximum numbers when the orchard was 9 years old and the ensuing larvae infested 33% of the clusters the following year. A marked decline in all stages occurred when the orchard was 11 to 12 years old and this was immediately followed by a second peak of less intensity on both cultivars. The only difference in mortality of the population on the two cultivars was found in neonate larvae. The average survival of egg to pupa for the 12-year period was near 7%. © 1978, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 10-mlb-thrust, concentric-tubes resistojet is being developed for use with biowaste propellants. The selection of a suitable material for the thruster heater parts is discussed; platinum-20% iridium is the present choice. Emphasis is placed on the problems of carbon deposition with propellant mixtures containing methane and of carbonyl attack by CO2. The biowaste resistojets have been strengthened to withstand launch vibration and acceleration loads, and the Mark II model has a trumpet-shaped nozzle with an expansion ratio of 400. Thrusting performance for methane, carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen, and typical biowaste propellant mixtures is presented. © 1971 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

AB  - In this study the objective was to determine the distribution of iodine in a tungsten-regenerative cycle lamp while the lamp was burning. The results presented are for the linear 500-w, 120- v, T3 lamp with an internal length of about 7 cm, and for the 1500-w 240-v lamp with an internal length of about 20 cm. The following parameters were varied to determine their effects on the iodine distribution-type of fill gas (Ar, Kr, Xe); cold gas pressure (375 to 3560 Torr); lamp orientation; lamp envelope diameter; filament design (with and without long lead legs); lamp length(7, 20 cm). It is shown that a vertically oriented regenerative cycle lamp behaves as a thermal diffusion column. The gas separation in a lamp is the result of a combination of two things-thermal diffusion and convection (laminar flow). Changing diameters,% gas type, tas pressure, or lamp length is aimed at the convective part. Inserting a concentric cylinder, or choosing a regenerative agent and fill gas with similar molecular weights, aimed at the other mechanism- preventing the thermal diffusion separation. Calculated values of the thermal diffusion factor for various trace gases are included as an aid to estimating separations.

AB  - When a uniform flow of any nature is interrupted, the readjustment of the flow results in concentrations and rare-factions, so that the peak value of the flow parameter will be higher than that which an elementary computation would suggest. When stress flow in a structure is interrupted, there are stress concentrations. These are generally localized and often large, in relation to the values indicated by simple equilibrium calculations. With the advent of the industrial revolution, dynamic and repeated loading of materials had become commonplace in engine parts and fast moving vehicles of locomotion. This led to serious fatigue failures arising from stress concentrations. Also, many metal forming processes, fabrication techniques and weak-link type safety systems benefit substantially from the intelligent use or avoidance, as appropriate, of stress concentrations. As a result, in the last 80 years, the study and and evaluation of stress concentrations has been a primary objective in the study of solid mechanics. Exact mathematical analysis of stress concentrations in finite bodies presents considerable difficulty for all but a few problems of infinite fields, concentric annuli and the like, treated under the presumption of small deformation, linear elasticity. A whole series of techniques have been developed to deal with different classes of shapes and domains, causes and sources of concentration, material behaviour, phenomenological formulation, etc. These include real and complex functions, conformal mapping, transform techniques, integral equations, finite differences and relaxation, and, more recently, the finite element methods. With the advent of large high speed computers, development of finite element concepts and a good understanding of functional analysis, it is now, in principle, possible to obtain with economy satisfactory solutions to a whole range of concentration problems by intelligently combining theory and computer application. An example is the hybridization of continuum concepts with computer based finite element formulations. This new situation also makes possible a more direct approach to the problem of design which is the primary purpose of most engineering analyses. The trend would appear to be clear: the computer will shape the theory, analysis and design. © 1974.

AB  - For 4 successive years, cultivars of winter wheat differing in resistance to eyespot (Cercosporella herpotrichoides) and to lodging were grown in plots in which different levels of eyespot were induced by inoculating at different times. Lodging was either allowed, or prevented by growing the plants through nets. Yield losses were greatest in the most severely infected plots in which lodging was allowed; losses were reduced where infection was less severe or where lodging was prevented. In the year in which eyespot was most severe, there was a significant regression of yield on disease severity, even for the plots in which lodging was prevented; where lodging was allowed, regression lines were steeper for the lodging susceptible cultivars, but did not differ for the lodging resistant cultivars. Eyespot reduced the number of tillers, measured in spring, but later there was partial compensation for these losses. Grain number per ear and 1000 grain weight of individual tillers were reduced by severe eyespot infection; moderate infection reduced only 1000 grain weight; slight infection caused no reduction. Tillers without severe infection produced extra grains in severely diseased plots, so that there was no overall effect of eyespot on grain number per ear. The results are discussed in relation to the breeding of dwarf cultivars, which may be highly resistant to lodging but can nevertheless suffer severe losses from eyespot.

AB  - Specialists in occupational diseases, neurology and ophthalmology made an analysis of 30 cases of methyl chloride poisoning reported in the years 1952-1971. Out of these 24 were of a professional, and 6 of an accidental nature. The average age of the poisoned persons was 43.6 yr. In the cases of industrial poisoning the exposure time varied from 5 days to 20 yr, and in the cases of accidental poisoning from 1 to 3 hours. 35 per cent of the professional poisonings were due to insufficient instruction, whereas the other cases had been caused by non observance of the rules concerning the technology of work and labour protection. One case proved fatal; in two others the course was grave involving personality changes and attempted suicide. In the remaining cases vertigo, vomitting, unsteady movements nausea, headache, eye complaints were subjectively dominating. Objectively, only rotary vertigo, staggering, and unsteady gait were found. Ophthalmologic findings concerned a narrowed visual field starting from the periphery, and concentric, central and paracentral scotomas. To prevent such poisonings is up to technology, and should be accelerated by quickly substituting Freon for methyl chloride.

AB  - The bare concentric neutral wires of underground electric distribution cables have corroded in soils not regarded as corrosive. The tinned-copper wires are important for safety and electrical integrity of the 7. 2 kV cables. Test data from four electric systems show consistent relationships between corrosion and measured dc potentials. Cathodic protection by means of sacrificial anodes, or through use of steel ground rods, appears to be feasible and economical as a means for preventing or controlling corrosion.

AB  - La structure de classe a l'interieur des groupes ethniques n'a pas fait l'objet d'etudes particulieres dans les recherches ecologiques. Etant donne que pour les donnees du Recensement de 1961, nous disposons de renseignements speciaux, il nous a ete possible d'etudier les modeles de meme que les niveaux de la segregation residentielle en se basant sur les differences dans l'occupation et le revenu de groupes de Toronto choisis en fonction de leur langue maternelle et de leur milieu de naissance. On a decouvert que la segregation de classe chez les groupes ethniques est aussi prononcee qu'elle Test dans les communautes de noirs des villes americaines. Le niveau du revenu a tendance a separer les residents d'une maniere plus determinante encore que le niveau professionnel. Les patrons de segregation, a l'interieur de chacune des communautes, s'inserent d'une maniere coherente dans un modele concentrique (pour evaluer la distance du centre de la ville). Social class segregation within ethnic groups has been neglected in ecological research. With the availability of 1961 special‐run census data, it was possible to analyse the extent and pattern of residential segregation based on occupation and income differences for selected mother‐tongue and birthplace groups in Toronto. It was found that social class segregation within ethnic groups is as high as that found within Negro communities of American cities. Income tends to sort out residents to a greater degree than does occupation and the pattern of segregation within each community is consistent with the distance (concentric) model.

AB  - Laboratory-reared 37-day-old white leghorn chicks were placed individually in an arena with one of a range of eight three-dimensional stimuli. The chick's behaviour was recorded over a 3-min period. Each bird was exposed to a stimulus which varied in three ways, being either circular concentric (eye-like) or rectangular, single or paired and which appeared to either persistently look at (track) or look away from (avoid) the chick. All three manipulations produced significant effects on how close the bird approached. The most avoided combination was two, tracking, eyelike shapes. The results are discussed in the context of the problems involved in isolating the effective components of stares and the head forwards threat posture. © 1976.

AB  - Laboratory-reared 40-day-old white leghorn chicks were placed individually in an arena with a dummy bird. The dummy was either a predator (kestrel) or a strange, non-predatory species (kiwi), further distinguished by the conspicuousness of the eye region. The hawk's eyes were either left intact (conspicuous) or covered. The kiwi's eyes were untouched (inconspicuous) or accentuated. Birds approached the unaltered kiwi but strongly avoided the hawk. Obscuring the eyes diminished hawk avoidance. Enhancement increased aversion to the kiwi. These results indicate the potential importance of the eyes as a stimulus feature of non-conspecifics. © 1976.

AB  - A group of 20 necropsies of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were selected because of the known complication of cerebral vasospasm. Evidence for vasospasm was radiological and pathological in 17 cases and pathological alone in 3 cases. A histological examination of the large arteries in areas known formerly to be in spasm showed that in the 13 early cases (death before 3 weeks) there were relevant changes in all layers of the arterial wall, the most significant being a degeneration of the media and elastica. In the 7 late cases (death after 3 weeks), in addition to the sequelae of the acute changes, there was marked concentric intimal thickening; and the localization was again in the particular segments of arteries formerly in spasm. Changes found in the small arteries, capillaries, and veins in the early and the late cases were thought to be caused by the ischemia due to the vasospasm. These changes were also seen in control material.

AB  - An autopsy case of a 36 yr old male with abnormal intracranial vascular networks containing an aneurysm is described. He had experienced his first attack of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at the age of 19 and died 1 wk after the third hemorrhage. Macroscopically, marked hypervascularization was observed on the convex surface in the area of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). The caliber of the Willis' circle arteries was irregular. By means of an operating microscope, the following findings were observed in detail. Both MCAs disappeared at a point 1 cm distal from the internal carotid bifurcation. Abnormal vascular networks demonstrated by angiography were proved to consist of the anterior choroidal arteries, the perforating arteries and branches of the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs). They were not much increased in number but showed a high degree of dilatation and tortuosity. Anastomoses between these branches were also seen. An aneurysm of about 0.5 cm in diameter was situated in the abnormal vascular networks and had not been revealed by postmortem angiography with barium sulfate. It was fed by one of the perforators arising from the left internal carotid artery. The cause of death was the rupture of the aneurysm into the ventricles. Histologically, stenosis or occlusion of the above mentioned arteries at the base of the brain was due to fibrous intima thickening without inflammatory or atheromatous changes. Marked concentric wrinkles of the internal elastic membrane and atrophy of the tunica media were seen at the stenotic arterial segment. The findings were most conspicuous in the MCAs and ACAs. The findings led to the conclusion that abnormal vascular networks at the base of the brain had probably formed a collateral circulation.

AB  - A formal model is presented that demonstrates how the color patterns of the wings of butterflies and moths can be analysed in terms of current concepts of pattern formation. A review of pertinent literature on this little‐known developmental system is provided. Crucial to the understanding of color pattern formation in lepidopteran wings is the realization that the wing pattern is a mosaic. The pattern in each wing cell (i.e., the area bordered by wing veins) is determined independently from the pattern in other cells. Within a cell, pigments are deposited in a definite relation to a central focus. A focus always lies on the cell midline and is often visible as a small pigmented dot. In the simplest condition the color pattern is laid down around a focus as a system of perfect concentric circles (eyespots). More often these circles are considerably distorted and have an axis of bilateral symmetry that parallels the wing veins. The nature and extent of these distortions from circularity account, to a large degree, for the species‐specific character of the wing pattern. The determination of such patterns is most readily explained if it is assumed that a focus represents the reference point with respect to which positional information (for pigment deposition) is specified. Circular patterns are thus obtained if all points equidistant from a focus undergo identical differentiation. Deviations from circularity of the pattern around a focus indicate that either the specification or interpretation of positional information is not the same in all areas around a focus. This phenomenon is most conveniently described as an “interpretation landscape”: a gradient system whose value at any point in a morphogenetic field is a measure of how positional information is to be interpreted at that location. Examples are provided of how species‐specific wing patterns can be generated by modest alterations in the shape of the interpretation landscape. As a rule the field of a focus is limited by the margins of the wing cell in which it is centered except in cases where no focus is present in an adjacent cell. Under those circumstances one focus can determine the pattern in several adjoining wing cells. Copyright © 1978 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Little attention has been paid to the various causes preventing or blocking a concentric reduction following traumatic dislocation of the hip without apparent fracture. In a review of fifty-four dislocations, nine required open reduction after either a failed attempt at closed reduction or a non-concentric reduction. The factors preventing closed reduction included the femoral head buttonholed through the capsule and the piriformis muscle displaced across the acetabulum. A concentric anatomical reduction was prevented because of an inverted limbus or an osteocartilaginous loose body in the acetabulum. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are discussed.

AB  - This chapter describes the preparation and properties of various types of vesicle dispersion. Although many naturally occurring and synthetic phospholipids can be used to form these vesicle dispersions, the discussion is restricted to the egg phosphatidylcholine vesicle system. The use of aqueous dispersions of lamellar phospholipid systems in the study of the structure, functions, and components of biological membranes has become widespread in recent years. Within each liposome the lipid is organized into concentric bimolecular lamellae, each separated from its neighbor by an interspersed lamella of water. The multicompartment character together with the marked size heterogeneity of this type of liposome make it difficult to relate biologically relevant properties to the surface area of the lipid lamellae. This limitation can be avoided by using a phospholipid dispersion in which the liposomes are spherical vesicles, homogeneous in size, each comprised of a single continuous lipid bilayer enclosing a volume of aqueous solution. © 1974, Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A new process for manufacturing crosslinked polyethylene insulated cables which is now expanding its use in the higher voltage field, was developed in Japan. The new process, which is called MDCV (Mitsubishi Dainichi Continuous Vulcanization), is a breakthrough for the problems which conventional steam curing process has both in the equipment and in the quality of the insulation. As a curing process MDCV has the following advantages: (1) it makes possible the use of the horizontal line which is economical and best suited for manufacturing large size cables, (2) it is a complete dry-curing process which prevents formation of microvoids due to water steam in the insulation layer, (3) vulcanization and cooling parts are completely separated and independently controlled. In addition, MDCV cable insulation absorbs far less water than steam cured insulation. The mechanism for keeping conductor concentricity in the MDCV process is discussed.

AB  - A new design has been developed that avoids fretting, undesired vibration, and other disadvantages of conventional heat exchangers and, at the same time, allows high system pressures and high outputs or flow velocities. The characteristic feature is that the heating surfaces are made up of finned tubes welded together to form continuous concentric walls.

AB  - Colonial green algae, Volvocales, include some phylogenetically important genera, among which Pleodorina is one of the most interesting. However, although Gerisch (1959) studied the mode of cellular differentiation in Pleodorina californica to some extent, Pleodorina has attracted much less attention of previous workers as compared to Volvox. Cells in a colony of Pleodorina are chlamydomonad in type and are embedded in a gelatinous matrix, consisting cells being regularly arranged in a single layer on the surface of a hollow sphere. The colony of Pleodorina is usually composed of 64 or 128 cells which are differentiated into only two types. The colony as a whole is phototactic and the part directed towards light is occupied by small somatic cells (S cells) having eye-spots and lacking the ability of reproduction, while larger cells in the opposite side are reproducing cells (R cells) which are capable of dividing and forming daughter colonies in the interior of the mother colony. R cells have no eye-spots. This paper deals with some biological features of Pleodorina californica. © 1978, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Circular structures, defined by arcuate, concentric ridges and scarps that surround hills, mesas, or crater-like depressions, are localized in an exceptionally thick section of the Roza Member of the Yakima Basalt on the Columbia Plateau. Autointrusive dikes are conspicuous in most ridge segments. Palagonite discovered in a few central hills appears genetically related to the ring structures and suggests an origin involving interaction of water and lava. The dikes intruded a crust about 30 m thick, however, so that substantial cooling must have occurred prior to formation of the rings. A plausible explanation for these unusual features may hinge on the disruption of drainage that occurred as a result of the voluminous basalt extrusion. If, after partial cooling, the molten interior of this thick ponded Roza flow were intersected by a rising ground-water table, rapidly accumulating volatiles could have caused explosive venting as well as doming and cracking of the crust, with concurrent emplacement of granulated sideromelane (later palagonitized) and tephra in craters and fractures. Subsidence of the crust after initial venting could have permitted intrusion of melt into fractures predominantly concentric to the focus of pressure release. Subsequent catastrophic erosion by the Missoula floods effectively removed most of the surficial clues to original structure and morphology, leaving the roots of these enigmatic features partly exposed. © 1978 Geological Society of America.

AB  - Various rates of nitrogen fertilizer were applied in early and late spring to two densities of winter wheat to examine their effects on grain yield and its components. A severe attack of ‘sharp eyespot’ (Rhizoctonia solani) allowed an assessment of the effects of the treatments on the incidence of this disease. The disease level was much higher where nitrogen was applied early and increased with increase in nitrogen up to 120 units applied; it was slightly higher at the higher density. Grain yield was slightly greater where nitrogen was applied late; early application gave more, but smaller, ears. Main shoots produced at least 70% of the grain in the high-density plots but less than 50% at the low density. Tillers appearing after early March contributed little to grain yield at the higher density but substantially at the lower one. Tillers produced after early April died without heading. In general, the chances of survival of a tiller diminished with delay in the time of its appearance, but some early tillers died while later ones survived and produced ears. The chances of survival of later tillers were greater at low density and high rates of nitrogen. © 1969, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Underground nuclear explosions in Yucca Flat produce fractures in the overlying alluvium. These fractures not only form the expected radial and concentric patterns, but also are commonly aligned along certain preferential directions. These preferential fracture trends form two groups: those that show a spatial relationship with the Yucca and related faults, and those that do not. The fracture trends unrelated to the Yucca fault parallel joint trends in the bedrock at the adjacent edge of the valley; the most conspicuous preferentially oriented fracture trends in the alluvium appear to parallel the set of most closely spaced joints in the bedrock. This similarity in trend of fractures and joints may result from differential movement, during an explosion, along joints in the underlying bedrock that parallel joints exposed in the valley sides. Fractures above explosions detonated in tuff beneath Yucca Flat show a greater degree of preferred orientation than those above explosions detonated in the alluvium. Some explosion-produced fractures related to the Yucca fault, a recently active north-trending fault in Yucca Flat, form an en echelon pattern along the fault trace. Other fractures and fracture zones branch from the fault trace, or lie adjacent and nearly parallel to it. One explosion caused vertical displacement of at least 18 inches, east side relatively down, across the main fractures along the fault. These fractures exhibit all the features of grouped fault scarps in alluvium as described by Gilbert in 1890 and Slemmons in 1957 and are, therefore, considered to be the result of faulting. The faulting is believed to be caused by pre-existing strain being released by the action of nuclear explosions, as the east side is always relatively down and the fracturing along the fault extensive.

AB  - In the ovary of Aptenia cordifolia and Platythyra haeckeliana placentary papillae produce a slime containing polysaccharides and proteins. These papillae show two types of conspicuous vacuoles enclosed by rough ER cisternae and complexes of concentrically arranged rough ER. The enclosed vacuoles probably play an important role in the accumulation of the polysaccharide-protein slime. In the case of storage vesicles (first vacuole type) derivates of the Golgi apparatus are enclosed by ER. In other instances (second vacuole type) ER cisternae which have lost their membrane-bound ribosomes seem to delimit protoplasmic regions free of organelles. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Like hundreds of other lunar craters of probable impact origin, Copernicus contains central peaks presumed to expose rocks uplifted from beneath the crater floor. A possible analog of these peaks on Earth is the central uplift of the Sierra Madera cryptoexplosion structure, a probable impact scar (astrobleme) in stratified Permian and Cretaceous rocks of west Texas. The most conspicuous part of this 12-km-wide structure is its central uplift, 6 to 8 km across, in which the oldest rocks have been raised 1,200 m above their normal position. The uplift is surrounded by a structural depression, beyond which is a concentric rim containing some folds and circumferential normal faults with downthrow toward the center. The intensity of folding and faulting increases inward from the flanks of the central uplift toward a central zone about 2 km across where dips and fold plunges are near vertical or overturned. As in salt domes, the beds moved inward as well as upward to occupy their present positions, causing faulting and radial folding due to crowding in the center. Repetition by folding due to inward movement of upper beds over lower appears to have been followed by upward movement of the core of the uplift pulling away from the flanks by faulting. Minor outward-directed thrusting may have been caused by gravitational spreading of the rising dome. The structural depression surrounding the uplift resulted from tectonic thinning accompanying the inward movement of rocks in the uplift. Analogy with experimental craters and with other cryptoexplosion structures indicates that the uplift at Sierra Madera protruded into a crater (since destroyed by erosion) that was about 12 km across. Inasmuch as the rocks forming such uplifts are derived from below the crater floors, analogous peaks in lunar craters such as Copernicus may offer samples of lunar crust uplifted from distances below the crater floor on the order of one-tenth of the crater diameter. © 1972, The Geological Society of America, Inc.

AB  - Astronomical refraction has had a long and fascinating history. Cleomedes (100 A.D.) and Ptolemy (200 A.D.) were aware of its existence and understood in a qualitative way some of its properties. Alhazen (1100 A.D.) quite correctly suggested that the flattening of the sun’s disk near the horizon was due to astronomical refraction. Tycho Brahe in 1587, however, was the first to make direct measurements of the magnitude of the refraction. The first theory of astronomical refraction based on Snell’s law was that of Cassini, who in 1656 looked upon the earth’s atmosphere as being of constant refractive index up to its upper limit at which all the refraction took place. Extensive investigations of the physical properties of the atmosphere modified these ideas and led to the “concentric spherical shell model” and the “plane parallel layer model,” the latter being an approximation for the former. Attempts to evaluate the “refraction integral” for the concentric spherical shell model have led to the theories of Bessel, Bradley, Gylden, Ivory, Laplace, Mayer, Simpson, Young, and others. At the beginning of the twentieth century, investigations on the physical properties of the atmosphere extended to higher elevations, and new physical properties appeared which were not anticipated by the earlier workers. This led to the celebrated work of Harzer, who for the first time was able to compute the astronomical refraction purely from meteorological measurements. Harzer also made the first detailed investigation of the applicability of the spherical shell model, which is used almost universally by workers in this field. Harzer’s work has served as a source of inspiration, but much remains to be done. This paper attempts to give a brief chronological description of some of the more significant theories of astronomical refraction for the purpose of pointing out the types of problems which have existed, how these problems were attacked, and the problems which still remain. It also gives adequate references for those wishing additional information. © 1962 Optical Society of America.

AB  - A study of the influence of various concentrations of NaCl on 21 species of dermatophytes and other keratolytic fungi was made. Based on the sensitivity of the species to various concentrations of NaCl, it was possible to divide them into 5 groups. Microsporum ferrugineum and Trichophyton concentricum and T. tonsurans were the most sensitive to NaCl and were inhibited by 5%. The greatest number of species were inhibited by 12% NaCl. The fungi most tolerant to NaCl were M. cookei and M. nanum, and T. mentagrophytes, T. schoenleinii, and T. terrestre. These species were inhibited by 15%. NaCl prevented any variant change in Epidermophyton floccosum, T. mentagrophytes, and M. gypseum, but promoted a change in phenotype in M. audouinii and M. cookei, and T. gallinae. It is suggested that the word 'pleomorphism' be replaced by the term sterile albinism. This term refers to that kind of cultural change when there is no evidence of sporulation and the white fluffy mycelium consists of fine sterile hyphae. Sterile albino strains of E. floccosum were induced to form macroconidia on Sabouraud cycloheximide chloramphenicol gentamicin agar (SCCGA) containing 3-5% NaCl. Also, M. audouinii formed microconidia and macroconidia in velvety growth cultured on SCCGA containing NaCl.

AB  - A high density gas target has been developed using a focussing effect in slightly underexpanded supersonic free-jets which are produced by axisymmetric Laval nozzles. Under constant pressure conditions the first density focus, a cylindrical flow portion of 3 mm diameter and of a length of about 5 mm and an almost homogeneous density distribution, is spatially fixed. By varying only the pressure of the gas in the entrance of the nozzle, the target thickness can be changed from less than 1 μg/cm2 to more than 100 μg/cm2. To avoid window foils in the target device, the secondary gas load is reduced by a three-stage dynamical pumping system which is built concentrically around the gas jet and which allows unrestricted 360° access to the target area. © 1979 North-Holland Publishing Co.

AB  - For large Reynold's numbers the number of vortices being formed in the flow between two co-axial spheres depends strongly on the angular acceleration of the inner sphere. The flow field can be calculated by finite difference approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Recent results, however, indicate that the number of the calculated vortices changes with the spatial resolution. This behaviour of the solution can be explained by the appearance of one or more extremals of the dependent flow variables in the meridional direction. For this reason either minima or maxima of the velocity and pressure may be suppressed if the step size is too large. These difficulties can be avoided if an accuracy condition is introduced which can be derived from the periodicity of the solution and the ratio of the radii of the spheres. Since the solution is timedependent the time step must also be restricted. The advantage of implicit methods which allow an unlimited time step can therefore not always be used in the problem under consideration. (A)

AB  - Several isolates of Rhizoctonia solani Kühn were obtained from wheat stems bearing lesions of sharp eyespot in the summers of 1960 and 1962. Differences in virulence of these isolates, assessed by severity of attack on seedlings, were demonstrated. Isolates taken from different plants in the same crop were shown to differ in virulence. All isolates obtained from wheat‐stem lesions attacked both winter and spring varieties of wheat, barley, oats and rye. Several varieties of spring and winter wheats showed no differences in susceptibility to disease. Infection of the wheat host took place at any time during the growing period, but was most severe in the earlier stages of growth. Sharp eyespot occurs over a wide range of soil types, but the most severe attacks all occurred on lighter soils with neutral to slightly acid pH. Sand‐culture experiments showed no effect of pH on disease development over the range 5·9‐8·1. Disease development in seedling wheat plants was favoured by cool (9·3°C.) dry (ca. 20% of the water‐holding capacity) conditions in the greenhouse. Disease incidence in the field over the period 1959‐63 could be correlated with the weather conditions prevailing over this time. Copyright © 1964, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The design adopted for the experiment was a leak tight thimble tube plunging into the reactor core and containing the target capsules concentrically surrounded by a stagnant water annulus for allowing the nuclear heat to be radially dissipated from the capsules to the cooling water flowing outside the thimble tube. An important question linked to this design was to know the maximum heat flux which may be admitted at the capsule surface to avoid film boiling and capsule damage by burnout. Results of systematic investigations by out-pile tests of the determining parameters are described.

AB  - The problem of the mechanical stringing of conductors for HV transmission lines with machines presently in use is considered. Based on the field practice, the limitations of the methods currently employed are established and an explanation of the phenomena taking place during the stringing is suggested. The functioning of a new type of machine recently developed with which it is possible to avoid the difficulties encountered is described. The new system is based on the use of a support constituted by rigid elements joined together by spherical hinges as support of the cable. This support is spirally wrapped around the first series of rolls giving it a cylindrical surface, and then around a second series of internal rolls concentric to the first one, creating thus a continuous chain.

AB  - This is an attempt to formulate the nature of the sacraments in relation to the Church, to the deposit of faith, and to church order, in order to try to establish a way of viewing sacramental practice in terms more positive than validity and invalidity, which now loom uncomfortably large over ecumenical relationships. Part I, dealing with three preliminary questions, first gives a survey of the pronouncements of the Church on the invalidity of Protestant sacraments; added to the defectus intentionis the Church denounces in the Protestant ministry a lack of competence to administer the sacraments after Baptism, even in the case of the Anglican Church, which claims a valid ministry. After this it is laid down that whereas the concept of (in)validity is only prominent in paradoxical situations (especially those in which mala fides plays a part), traditional theology has formulated the nature of the sacrament almost exclusively in terms of (in)validity, thus basing itself on a marginal concept of the sacraments instead of on their normal, fruitful celebration, in which the awareness of (in)validity is virtually absent. Finally, two current evaluations of Protestant sacraments are rejected as unsatisfactory. The first holds that Protestant sacraments celebrate salvation only spiritually, not really; this distinction is put aside as falsifying the nature of the sacrament as a sign, and the incarnatory character of grace. The second holds that a Protestant sacrament is a votum sacramenti; this is rejected because it puts the disposition outside the sacrament itself, unless the formula is understood to mean: a desire of the recognition of the sacrament, in which case it would be acceptable as a basis for discussion. Part II is entitled: The Role of Church and Church Doctrine. It is suggested that the development of ecclesiology under the influence of ecumenicism may provide a fresh background to current sacramental theology. Up to Mystici Corporis the Catholic view of reunion was largely retrospective and historical; it could only be conceived in terms of return, of a restoration of a lost unity. But the “concentric” view of the Church as well as the conception of the”people of God” have done much to make theologians aware of the provisional character of many structures in the Church, which in Mystici Corporis had been rather too massively identified with the eschatological Church itself. Thus, the essential unity of the Church has come to be viewed as Christ's eschatological gift to his people rather than as the institutional unity around the deposit of faith and church order. Thus, Church reunion has come to be viewed eschatologically and prospectively. Creeds and church orders are partial, provisional realizations of the Church of the eschaton, and if the Churches are not to suffer from sclerosis, they are continually to refer their teachings and regulations to the eschaton. If the Churches, in an ecumenical spirit, do not mutually condemn one another on the basis of these provisional realities, but recognize each other as Churches on the strength of their willingness to regauge creeds and church orders, (which willingness or obedience of faith, marks them as true Churches),—then they are no longer caught up in the mutual excommunications of the past. But since sacraments are acts of the Church, and real according as the Church that celebrates them is real, the question may be raised whether the sacramental celebrations of Protestant Churches cannot be called true sacraments.—This is applied to the question, whether the Protestant Churches are orthodox with regard to the sacraments. Faith and dogma, although forming one reality, are not identical. Dogma is essentially provisional and asks for continual revision and complement in order to approximate the fullness of faith. The basic condition for a true sacrament is the intentici faciendi quod facit Ecclesia, i.e. the fundamental act of faith. This act of faith is indeed judged by the standard of orthodoxy, but if the Churches are prepared to revise and complete their creeds, doctrinal differences would seem no longer to be indicative of defectus intentionis. This is not to say that Protestant sacraments are valid, since this would imply full recognition on the level of doctrine; but the essence of he sacrament is not in its validity, which is a consequence on the level of Church order rather than the basis of a true sacrament. Part III, entitled: The Competence of the Minister, sets out to state that the sacraments are not entirely tied up with the minister ordinarius. Not only can some sacraments in cases of emergency still be administered by extraordinary ministers, but all the sacraments have in the course of history been administered by ministri extraordinarii, whether canonically authorized or not. Mere canonical authorization, however, is not the source of the sacrament, since canon law, or church order, is merely a juridical formalization of the organic ordo caritatis; it is an advance recognition of the validity of a ministry which is basically authorized by the presence of Christ in the Church. In normal cases, anyone unauthorized who would venture to administer a sacrament would frustrate the celebration, not because he would be going against canon law, but because by going against canon law he would ex supposito go against the mind of the Church, and thus manifest defectus intentionis. In extraordinary circumstances, however, the law is suspended; and even though special canonical provisions have been made for cases of emergency, no lawgiver can ever hope to provide for all emergencies. It is suggested, therefore, that the canonical system of extraordinary ministers does not exhaust the possibilities. If sacraments are celebrated in good faith and praeter (not contra) ordinem on account of suspension of church order—and these conditions may well prevail in Protestant Churches—it is submitted that the question may be asked whether these are not true sacraments, although still in need of recognition, i.e. validity. Part IV (The Essence of the Sacrament of Order and its Canonical Shape) deals with the question, whether the Protestant ministry itself can be described in terms of the Sacrament of Order. As a preliminary step it is laid down that the Church (or the laity) and the ministry cannot be two entirely irreducible levels; both the New Testament and the tradition of the Church view the ministry as a diakonia to the Church, organically and authoritatively functioning in the community as a principle of order. A parallel is drawn between kerygma and dogma on the one hand, and Church and Ordo on the other; both pairs present a living structure, in which the latter of each pair acts as a principle of order to the former. The prototypical form of dogma is Scripture, the prototypical form of Ordo is the apostolic ministry; they were both recognized in the second century, in the canon of Scripture and in apostolic episcopacy respectively. Thus, apostolic succession is the principle of order of the apostolic tradition, which are no more two irreducible strains in the history of the Church than Ordo and Church. It is pointed out that defining Ordo and apostolic succession entirely in terms of service to Church and apostolic tradition does not degrade the authority of the hierarchy to a merely delegated one, since the Ordo sacramentally embodies and personifies ”ex sese” the corporate faith of the Church. With regard to apostolic succession in history (the”pipeline”), it is suggested that this is in the first place a succession in office: successio in locum Petri, in locum apostolorum. By this emphasis on locus the burden of church doctrine is brought to bear on the organic diakonia in the Church, after the prototype of the apostolic ministry in the primitive community. It is then submitted that the historical succession, in the form of episcopal consecration, first generally prescribed by the Council of Nicaea, is the canonical realization of the essential apostolic succession in office. In this hypothesis, failure to abide by the canonical concretization frustrates the Sacrament of Order, not by itself, but because ex supposito this is mala fides with respect to the diakonia and the unity of the Church. But it may be asked whether there is not a true Sacrament of Order in cases where the ministry in its formal,”diaconal” aspects is faithfully exercised, provided church order is along episcopal lines, even if praeter ordinem the ministry does not receive its office as a result of historical succesion. Finally, Part V, entitled Perspective with Reservations, tries to view the problem of communicatio in sacris as a necessary concomitant of ecumenicism. Ecumenicism, it is suggested, has caused a landslide in this problem. If traditional moral theology held communicatio in sacris sinful in itself, only to be condoned for special reasons, the ecumenical spirit requires it, even if for good, although regrettable, reasons full intercommunion or communion cannot as yet be achieved. For communicatio in sacris to be lawful some conditions must be fulfilled. Positively, there must be a measure of doctrinal agreement, at least to such an extent that differences in doctrine are covered by a clear awareness of the possibility of eventual agreement resulting from willingness to revise and complement established doctrine. Negatively, communicatio in sacris may not be intended as an act of disloyalty to one's own creed and church order; this requires in the individual participant an integration of established doctrine into a perceptive appreciation of the possibilities of doctrinal development, and avoidance of scandal. Communicatio in sacris cannot help straddling the fence; retrospectively it requires loyalty to, prospectively it is the fruit of an awareness of the provisional character of, creeds and church orders. Finally, it is pointed out that, since full unity will only be achieved in the eschaton, the unity of the Church in via will always be provisional, i.e. work along the lines of communion and even intercommunion of larger units in the Church. This means that the concept of sacramental validity as an expression of inter-church recognition will always be a necessary feature of sacramental practice. © 1965 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Captive lesser mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) were observed to avert their heads during face-to-face encounters. Based on evidence obtained from other vertebrate species, predominantly among the Primates, it was assumed that the facing orientation and direction of gaze of an adversary was the provocative agent eliciting gaze aversion by mouse lemurs. A more precise examination of the perceptual determinants of gaze aversion employed models presenting various combinations of eyelike concentric circles. Presented side-by-side in paired comparisons, it was predicted that a model presenting two horizontally placed concentric circles, which schematically resemble two facing eyes, would elicit less visual inspection, i.e., more visual avoidance, than models presenting less physiognomic arrangements of concentric circles. Using a special model-viewing apparatus, Experiment I examined the gaze behavior of 28 mouse lemurs in their peak activity period to determine the response-eliciting effectiveness of 5 models varying in the number of concentric circles. Experiment 2 examined 50 lemurs, some of which were in seasonally and artificially induced torpor. Three models differing in the spatial orientation of two concentric circles were investigated in an attempt to control for contour complexity. Both the bout frequency and duration of model fixation were measured using head orientation as the response criterion. The following results were obtained: 1. For the over-all paired comparisons in both experiments, the model presenting two horizontally positioned concentric circles was the only model which elicited significantly fewer bouts of longer fixation. 2. Because of a lack of homogeneity in model fixation, due to intense fear in some lemurs, the lemurs were separated into homogeneous subgroups using statistical criteria in the first experiment and behavioral criteria in the second. Only the largest subgroups comprising relatively calm mouse lemurs exhibited differential model fixation at a significant level. In both experiments, these particular subgroups looked significantly less at the critical model exhibiting two schematic facing eyes than at any of the other models. In conjunction with observations of dyadic interactions among mouse lemurs, the experimental findings suggest the following: 1. Two schematic facing eyes viewed out of context with a predator or conspecific are a provocative source of stimulation eliciting less visual inspection which could be considered analogous to bouts of gaze aversion observed among interacting lemurs. 2. In concordance with laboratory observations of attenuated gaze aversion by frightened mouse lemurs, the more fear-motivated lemurs in the present experiments exhibited reduced differential model inspection. The affinity between these findings implies, perhaps, that fear-motivation increases the tendency to engage in less selective investigative gazing as the animal shifts into a protective behavior mode. This as well as any other functional interpretation of the role of gaze behavior during agonistic encounters, however, awaits further experimental support. © 1978, Brill. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultrastructure and acid phosphatase activity of aged calls of Euglena granulata are reported. Cells are spherical, quiescent, and nonflagellated. The most conspicuous attribute of aged cells is the accumulation of cyloplasmic vacuoles and lysosome‐like structures containing heavily stained, pigmented bodies and membrane fragments. In chloroplasts, portions of whorled lamellae arc abscised and subsequently incorporated into lysosome‐like structures; osmiophilic granules increase in number. Membranes surrounding eyespot granules disappear and the granules themselves become diffuse; the usual association with microtubules is not seen in aged cells. Acid phosphatase precipitation accumulates largely at the maturing face of dictyosomes and associated vesicles; there is also activity in multivesicular and lysosome‐like vacuoles.

AB  - Doxapram was administered intraperitoneally to pregnant ICR-JCL mice, in doses of 20, 80 and 144 mg/kg/day for 6 days from day 7 to day 12 of gestation. Saline was similarly given to control animals. Pregnant mice receiving 114 mg/kg of doxapram showed a reduced maternal weight gain. The body weight of fetuses was decreased and the fetal resorption rate was significantly higher in the doxapram group at 144 mg/kg than in the controls. Incidence of skeletal anomalies was significantly higher in the 144 mg/kg doxapram group than in the controls though most of them were concentrically observed only in one mother. No adverse fetal effect was noted in the 20 and 80 mg/kg groups. The findings indicate that, under the present experimental conditions, doxapram at a high dose level is embryotoxic in mice.

AB  - To examine the testispherite centres transverse ground sections of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) egg shell were observed after decalcification or after etching their upper surface by Calcinase (EDTA); staining with thionine followed. In the first case the organic substance remained in the centre, shows a distinctly concentric growth layering and a fine radial structure. As the innerst appears the sharp contrasted "central grain", than a light halo confined by a strong stained boundary which below is in contact with the shell membrane; it corresponds to the "primary spherite". The farther circular layerings remain incomplete, end at the shell membrane, so that the eisospherite has no stratification. The described details return in all testispherite centres of the same ground section in identical manner, conditioned by rhythmical secretion of the shell forming material. When two or more spherite centres are in close contact the layerings break off at the separating plane and here melt together. The superposition of the polarization-with the staining-picture on the etched ground section shows the agreement of the layering for the organic and the mineral componente, from which the last is the leading. Globular inclusions appear above the primary spherite; they were not found in the eisospherite. The inclusions are stainable with thionine after decalcification or etching. The isospherite will be perforated by the shell membrane fibres, just so the free calcit deposits, which can appear in the deeper membrane layers. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The dorsal hindwing eyespot of Auiomeris io and other conspicuous markings associated with it are characterized. Modifiers maintain size in proportion to wing surface sufficient to provide an effective display of color as a predator-startling mechanism. Its reduction in size affects viability and fitness. Behaviorally, as a startling mechanism, it is genetically protected from variants that affect the eyespot itself, as evidenced by lethality of the homozygous dominant in the broken-eye variant and the rapid lowering of fitness in eyespot reduction experi ments. It would appear that the behavior activities as sociated with the eyespot as a mechanism for survival can be substantiated genetically. © 1978 AMERICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION.

AB  - Two cases of intraosseous neurofibromas of the mandible are presented. Only 25 cases of this tumor have been published previously. Of the present two cases, one was located at the upper border of the mandible, in the left second molar area where the tooth had been extracted 2 years previously. In the second case, the tumor presented itself as a 10 X 2 cm large destruction, mainly following the course of the alveolar nerve from the mandibular foramen to the mental foramen in the right side of the jaw. The mandibular first right molar was missing but a relationship between the extraction of the tooth and the development of the tumor could not be demonstrated. Histologically, the two tumors differed in the way that case 1 showed a conspicuous amount of delicate, wavy fibrils, some of which showed concentric lamellations resembling the pacinian corpuscle but without neurites in the sections available, whereas case 2 contained several large neurites containing nerve fiber bundles and also, demonstrated a slight pleomorphism. © 1978, Munksgaard International Publishers Ltd..

AB  - Synthetic sex pheromones were evaluated in apple orchards against the pests Spilonota ocellana (D. & S.), Archips argyrospilus (Walker), Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), and Pandemis limitata (Robinson). Significant correlations between spring larval counts and captures of males in summer in pheromone traps occurred only at moderate to high population levels. Correlations between captures of males in summer and fruit damage occurred only with S. ocellana. The attractants for S. ocellana, A. argyrospilus, and C. rosaceana appear satisfactory but that for P. limitata, possibly due to species identification uncertainty and low populations, requires further evaluation. © 1978, Entomological Society of Canada.

AB  - Morphologically, the development of spermatia in Levringiella gardneri and Erythrocystis saccata is identical, although cytologically several differences are evident. Mature spermatia contain 1 or 2 large spermatial vesicles that contain fibrous material, several small mitochondria, some proplastids, and are surrounded by a wall, either single‐layered as in Erythrocystis or triple‐layered as in Levringiella. Spermatial vesicles are formed by aggregations of endoplasmic reticulum in Levringiella, whereas concentric membrane bodies and dictyosomes may be involved in Erythrocystis. In addition to being fibrillar, the contents of the vesicle assume a convoluted appearance in Levringiella. Several spermatia are formed per mother cell and are connected by small pit connections which rupture to allow spermatial release from the spermatangial branch. Copyright © 1972, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - A field trial of autumn‐sown rye cv. Lovaszpatonai subject to natural infection with Cercosporella herpotrichoides showed that eyespot, in the absence of lodging, was significantly correlated with reduced grain size and 1,000 grain weight but not with total yield in weight of grain. No seed treatment affected total yield although benomyl significantly increased fertile tiller number, increased the percentage of lesion‐free tillers in April, and by July, compared with the control, had reduced the number with eyespot lesions by 38 per cent. In laboratory experiments organomercury and a combined treatment of organomercury plus chlormequat protected seedlings from attack by seedborne fungi and in the field trial these treatments also increased the percentage of lesion‐free tillers in April but did not affect the numbers with eyespot in July.

AB  - The fine structure of the protoplasmic droplet of epididymal spermatozoa of bull, ram, rabbit, and rat is described, as well as its development in the testis of bull and rabbit. The droplet is bounded by the cell membrane, and its substance borders on the neck and middle piece. The internal structure is comprised of fine, curved tubules, many small and some larger vesicles, and a ground cytoplasm, which is rather dense in the rabbit and the rat. Rat spermatozoa show a conspicuously large droplet with the membraneous structures asymmetrically distributed. Droplets of spermatozoa from the most posterior part of the epididymis of bull and ram generally show an altered structure with many curved, often concentric lamellae. No change in the ultrastructure of the middle piece was observed in connection with the movement of the droplet. The membraneous structures of the droplet assemble in the neck region o. late spermatids as small vesicles in bulls, and as tubules and vesicles in rabbits These structures probably represent both elements from the disintegrating Golgi apparatus and vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum. © 1961 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The ultrastructure of Dunaliella salina is described. Its structural organisation is rather similar to that previously reported for other Volvocales. The lack of a cellulosic wall is confirmed; the protoplast is bounded only by the monolayered plasma membrane which covers also the flagella. The conspicuous cup-shaped chloroplast fills up the whole back part of the cell and its terminal part is close to the anterior pole: Consequently all the other cellular organelles are confined in its deep anterior cavity. The pyrenoid is located in the back part of the chloroplast: Communication between the pyrenoid and the surrounding chloroplast is established by a system of paired lamellae. The droplets of carotenoids which form the eyespot are not stacked in regular order. The Golgi apparatus is located in the anterior part and is formed by two conspicuous dictyosomes. A great number of vesciculae, perhaps formed by the dictyosome, are crowded around the insertion of the two flagella. Evidence for the existence of an endoplasmic reticulum is uncertain. Two unknown structures are observed and their morphological organisation is described. © 1964, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) is a subcortical, telencephalic structure in reptiles and birds that protrudes into the lateral ventricle. The structure of DVR has been studied in the red‐eared turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) in Nissl and Golgi preparations. The DVR in Pseudemys is divided into the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge (ADVR) and the basal dorsal ventricular ridge (BDVR) by the dorsal branch of the middle ventricular sulcus. The structure of ADVR has been examined in detail. The ADVR is divided into four regions with distinct boundaries termed dorsal area, medial area, ventral area and central area. Dorsal area, medial area and ventral area border on the lateral ventricle; central area lies deep to the other areas. Three classes of neurons are found in Golgi preparations of ADVR. Juxtaependymal cells have somata near the perikarya of ependymal cells; their dendrites are found primarily in a periventricular fiber zone. Aspiny neurons were observed only in the dorsal half of ADVR and appear to be restricted to deep regions of the ridge. These multipolar neurons are rarely encountered in Golgi preparations, and the observed distribution may not represent their actual distribution in ADVR. The majority of the cells observed in ADVR are spiny neurons with dendritic fields that range from stellate to double‐pyramidal. Cells in this class may be subdivided on the basis of axonal morphology into at least two groups, but further studies are needed to determine the range of axonal morphology exhibited by these neurons. An analysis of the distribution of these cell types in Golgi material shows that dorsal area, medial area and ventral area are organized in four zones concentric with the ventricular surface. Central area apparently lacks a concentric pattern of organization. Zone 1 is a periventricular fiber band that contains juxtaependymal neurons and ascending dendrites of zone 2 spiny neurons, and it may serve as a structural substrate for segregated input onto these cell populations. Zone 2 contains clusters of spiny neurons with apposed somata, which vary in size and distribution between areas. Dendrites of zone 4 neurons are also found in the deep half of zone 2. Zone 3 is a cell‐poor region which lies at the center of a region of overlapping dendritic fields of zone 2 and zone 4 neurons. Zone 4 contains predominantly spiny neurons (aspiny neurons are found only in the dorsal half of ADVR) which are either isolated or in small clusters with apposed somata. Dendrites of zone 2 cells extend superficially into zone 4, so that the deep portions of zone 4 may be a substrate for segregated input to zone 4 neurons. These zones are differentially elaborated in each area. Central area, by contrast, consists of scattered spiny and aspiny neurons among fibers connecting ADVR and the lateral forebrain bundle. A comparison of these findings with the ADVR of snakes (Ulinski, '78a,b) shows both similarities and differences in DVR organization in the two taxa. Although snakes lack areal divisions, ADVR is organized in four concentric zones (zones A‐D). Zones A and B resemble zones 1 and 2 in turtles, consisting of a superficial fiber zone and a subjacent cell cluster zone. The clusters are smaller in snakes than in turtles. However, snakes lack a cell‐poor band deep to zone B, and dendrites of cells in zone C enter zone A. Thus, there are differences in both areal and zonal dimensions of ADVR organization in turtles and snakes. Copyright © 1978 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Investigations were conducted into the effect of the composition of the plasma-forming gas and that of the parent metal on the degree of the nitrogen saturation of the cut edge of the metal. Three different steels were investigated. It has been found that the formation of pores in the automatic submerged-arc welding of steel components cut by air-plasma cutting is casued by the nitrogen saturation of the cut edges, which depends on the chemical composition of the steel and is almost independent of the composition of the plasma-forming gas. To prevent pore formation, the cut edges should be protected with a stream of oxygen supplied concentrically to the plasma jet.

AB  - With a nonaqueous microdissection technique, the cytoplasm of Chironomus salivary gland cells can be separated into concentric zones situated at increasing distances from the nuclear envelope. This dissection technique is used here to investigate the cytoplasmic distribution of 75S RNA of Balbiani ring origin. The Balbiani ring 75S RNA has properties of a messenger RNA coding for secretory proteins. After a pulse of RNA precursor to the living animal, labeled Balbiani ring 75S RNA is found mainly in the cytoplasm located closer to the nuclear envelope, with smaller amounts toward the periphery of the cell. This gradient, initially very steep, lasts for at least 2 days, but less than 6 days. Experiments with 5-fluorouridine indicate that the formation of the gradient does not depend upon simultaneous export of ribosomal subunits. After a pretreatment of the animals with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, however, newly synthesized 75S RNA distributes evenly in the cytoplasm - that is, this treatment prevents the formation of the 75S RNA gradient. The gradient in salivary glands of normally cultured animals is therefore likely to be the result of diffusion restriction of the labeled 75S RNA. Thus the 75S RNA located closer to the nuclear envelope is the most recently exported 75S RNA. An explanation of these results is that the 75S RNA associates with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum early or immediately after nuclear release. This association should occur in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus and may occur either as single particles and/or as parts of polysomes. © 1978.

AB  - The type S 125 Z automatic introduced by the West German firm of Strohm is equipped with a hobbing unit which enables gear cutting to be carried out as part of the working cycle for producing a small pinion component for a watch or instrument movement from bar material. Since a full sequence of operations can be completed at one setup, high accuracies for concentricity can be obtained, the need for a second operation for gear cutting is avoided, and the overall cycle time is reduced. For gear cutting, indexing drive between the hobbing unit and the headstock spindle on the automatic is transmitted by a shaft and gearing, after the main drive has been disengaged.

This last anomaly may give rise to two concentric cells. Furthermore the character of stomatic mother-cell may invade the whole meristemoid cell and give then polyploid anomocytic stomata. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Winter wheat drilled directly into stubble or pasture treated with paraquat to kill the vegetation has been found to be less severely attacked by take‐all (Ophiobolus graminis (Sacc.) Sacc.) and eyespot (Cercosporella herpotrichoides Fron) than wheat drilled after cultivation. The reduction of take‐all is associated, not with a direct effect of the chemical, but with factors, resulting from the technique, which limit the rate of spread of the fungus in the undisturbed soil.

AB  - Spiral-groove bearings were studied in order to determine the axial and radial load capacities by finding the pressure of the lubricating film. The differential equation of smoothed pressure was derived from the Reynolds equation, and the axial load capacities were considered for concentrically operating bearings. The theory of spiral-groove journal bearings, load capacity, functional losses, and stability are discussed. Experiments to prevent leakage of the lubricant in self-sealing spiral-groove journal bearings are described.

AB  - Plots in a bearing apple orchard were sprayed with formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner on five to seven occasions in each of four consecutive seasons. Larvae of the winter moth, eye-spotted bud moth, orchard tent caterpillar, and fall webworm were less numerous on foliage in plots treated with B. thuringiensis than in the check plot. Numbers of free-living blister mites were reduced by treatment with the bacterium. Other phytophagous mites were not numerous in any of the plots. Injury to fruit by larvae of the codling moth, winter moth, and eye-spotted bud moth and by the mirid Atractotomus mali (Meyer) was lower in plots treated with the bacterium. Only three taxa of predacious arthropods were consistently affected by the application of B. thuringiensis; one was less numerous where the bacterium was applied and two were more numerous. © 1965, Entomological Society of Canada.

AB  - The fungus Helminthosporium sacchari Butler, known to be the cause of eye spot, a common air‐borne disease of sugar‐cane leaves, is now shown to be the cause of an undescribed seed‐borne disease of sugar‐cane seedlings. It is therefore suggested that the disease should be renamed eye spot and seedling blight of sugarcane. The symptoms of seedling blight are described, and the pathogenicity of the fungus to sugar‐cane seedlings is confirmed. Incidence of seedling blight is shown to be markedly affected by the growing conditions, and disease‐escape is common. The two most important factors predisposing seedlings to attack appear to be (i) the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and (ii) the occurrence of a check to the continuous growth of the seedlings. With the discovery of the existence of seedling blight, eye spot assumes a particular significance in plant‐breeding plots, because it may be responsible for the loss of sugar‐cane seedlings, any one of which is potentially a desirable new variety.

AB  - During the months of January and February 1950 a leafspot disease of young lettuce caused by Pleospora herbarum was met with in vegetable nurseries especially in the environs of Rotterdam. The round leafspots were brown with a lighter centre; some spots showed concentric rings. The infestation was on the whole not of a serious nature, only in one case 70% of the plants was attacked. Control was restricted to removing of the diseased leaves and to filling blanks. When weather conditions improved towards the end of February the slightly diseased plants developed further normally. © 1951 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Kapingamarangi Atoll of the Caroline Islands consists of a peripheral reef, 1000-4000 feet across, surrounding a nearly circular lagoon which is 5 by 6 nautical miles in area and about 240 feet at maximum depth. Thirty-three islands, most of which are less than half a mile in length, are scattered along the eastern half of the peripheral reef. At least 75 patch reefs, most of which are small, nearly symmetrical mounds, rise to the surface of the lagoon. The peripheral reef and the patch reefs, composed largely of the stony structures of corals and coralline algae, have flat upper surfaces, apparently the result of bevelling by waves during a recent lowering of sea level. The islands on the peripheral reef are formed of partially consolidated stratified sediments composed of clastic limestone particles and the shells of marine animals. These islands are migrating lagoonward across the reef flat because of erosion on the seaward sides and the growth of beaches and bars on the opposite sides. Soils on the islands are poorly developed and retain much of the texture, structure, and composition of the parent rock or sediment. They consist chiefly of mechanical mixtures of carbonaceous material and lime gravel, lime sand, or lime mud. Phosphorite is present on some islands and is still forming locally where apatite derived from bird guano is reacting with limestones. The tidal fluctuation of ground-water lenses, determined on islands of several sizes, ranges from about 4 to 18 inches. In one very small island where the water is brackish, the rise is much greater. The time lag between tidal movements and the rise and fall of fresh water in the islands ranges from a few minutes on very small islands up to 5 hours on some large ones. This time lag is controlled by the permeability of rocks composing an island and varies from one area to another according to the distribution of rock types. The lagoon contains six concentric belts of bottom sediment; in each, the composition and texture depend on the depth of water in which it occurs. Lime sand and lime gravel derived for the most part from the shells of animals form most of the sediment, but a lime mud covers the bottom of the deepest parts of the lagoon. Waves and currents cause gradation between types of sediment to a depth of about 30 feet, but little mixing was detected at greater depths. © 1958, The Geological Society of America, Inc.

AB  - A powder camera is described which was designed for the purpose of taking x-ray photographs through an x-ray diffraction angle of 0°-45° in a cylindrical camera of 57.3-mm radius, to temperatures greater than 300°C. The essential features are (1) a concentric heater extending above and below the sample to minimize sharp temperature gradients; (2) easy access to the oven coils if adjustment is necessary; (3) an iron-constantan thermocouple of small dimensions which allows one to take temperatures close to the sample; (4) a water-cooled jacket surrounding the oven to avoid heating the film. Rotation of the sample at 1 r.p.m. is provided for. Calibration of the thermocouple and the type of capillaries are described for high temperatures.

AB  - The literature with regard to visual field changes during pregnancy is carefully reviewed. Study of twenty-nine inmates of a nursing home for expectant mothers showed definite concentric contraction of form and color fields, and also enlargement of the blind spot in the majority of the cases. On the basis of the visual fields, radiographic measurements and investigations of vital function in this series of cases, the author concludes that the field changes in pregnancy probably depend upon functional modification rather than upon enlargement or vascular changes in the pituitary glands. The question whether these field changes are to be regarded as physiological or pathological is still unsettled. © 1930.

AB  - The morphology of the underside wing-patterns of Prepona and Agrias, two closely allied genera of the South American Nymphaloid butterflies, has been investigated. The Nymphaloid prototype (text-fig. 1, p. 295) constructed by the author (1924) proved to be a basic scheme of their wing-pattern, 26 out of 41 components, which the prototype is built of, being recorded in them (text-fig. 6, p. 321). This result is very important as the two genera belong to the most highly specialised ones among Rhopalocera and their deviation from the prototype is uncommonly great. The prototype undergoes in Prepona and Agrias very numerous and variable modifications, which have been studied by the method of morphological series used in the previous publications of the author. The most remarkable among the modifications is the positional inversion of the pattern components, the essence of which is, that a component lying distally from another component in the prototype, comes to lie proximally from that component in the modified pattern and thus the relative positions of a pair of components become inverted compared with the prototype (text-fig. 3, p. 311). The inversion of components not being frequent has been recorded, however, in several pairs of components and in connection with the author's previous data may be regarded as a profound and powerful principle governing the evolution of the wing-pattern and resulting in a status which is in contradiction with the principal criterion of homology viz. that of position. The gradual development of the positional inverstion is restricted to Prepona, while Agrias shows only final stages of it. The formation of "false eye-spots" is discovered in Prepona, which are "budding off" from one of the stripes. In connection with the facts recorded in the other genera the budding of components may be numbered among the rules of the pattern evolution previously formulated by the author. A number of modifications of the prototype are recorded in Prepona, which are rather resembling those occurring in the other groups, which makes close the connection of the genus with the main stem of Nymphalidæ. Different is the case of Agrias, which genus being an undoubted derivative from Prepona follows a singular way in its evolution. The principal interest of the latter lies in the fact that a number of dislocations and coalescences develop in the Agrias pattern which do not occur in the other genera and several complex components thus arise, which are of a very singular morphological composition. Besides this the wing-pattern of Agrias is very polynome, i.e. its components are very numerous and exhibit utmost nigrism and expansion of the great majority of components. All that results in a most peculiar aspect of Agrias hindwings. Its forewings, however, show quite another type of pattern, which seems rather frequent in some other highest exotic Nymphalidæ and is not fully analysed yet. Among the different types of the Prepona pattern two are especially aberrant, which are called werncri and amphimachus pattern according to the names of corresponding species. In the former some uncommon dislocations on the forewing result in its being obliquely crossed by three parallel rectilinear stripes (fig. 24). In the latter both wings are divided into distal dark and proximal light halves and all the pattern components situated in the light half are almost totally vanishing (figs. 55, 56). The hindwing patterns of Agrias are classified under three main types which according to specific names are called sardanapalus, amydon and hewitsonius types and evolve from the Prepona pattern and from one another in the sequence given (text-fig. 8, p. 385). Sardanapalus is the central type of the genus, amydon differs from it in some supplementary complex components and pronounced nigrism, hewitsonius shows total elimination of a great number of components. The phenomena of elasticity and of interaction of pattern components previously established by the author are recorded in Prepona and Agria as well. A sort of classification of the complex components is given, their two principal categories being named homomere and heteromere. In the former every two coalescing cell-portions lie in the same cell, in the latter they belong to different (neighbouring) cells. The amydon type of the Agrias pattern shows a complex stripe in which both homomere and heteromere coalescences are recorded. This may be called "super-complex" component. © 1930.

AB  - As known quite well, the figural aftereffect occurs in such a way that the apparent extent of the <I>test figure</I> is affected when an <I>inspection figure</I> precedes the <I>test figure</I>, while a so-called assimilation-contrast illusion of the visual extent takes place when they are presented simultaneously. In the present investigation, the effect of the <I>inspection figure</I> upon the estimation of the <I>test figure</I>, besides both of the above mentioned effects, was confirmed, when the <I>test figure</I> precedes the <I>inspection figure</I>. We call this effect&ldquo;retroactive figural-effect&rdquo;. The black contour circles on a white card were presented in succession by a revised Dodge-tachisto-scope and Harvard time-apparatus. The spatial arrangement of figures in shown in Fig. 1 where an <I>inspection figure</I> (I) and a <I>test figure</I> (T) of 30mm. in diameter are found on the left side of a fixation point and a <I>comparison figure</I> (C) which is variable in size with 1mm. steps is on the right side. T and C were always presented simultaneously. The PSE was determined by <I>the method of complete series</I>, and it was checked against the constant error in PSE due to possible inhomogeneity between the right and left visual fields. The final results were as follows :<BR>1. The retroactive-effect of I. upon the estimation of the extent of T. was conspicuous when I. followed T. The retroactive-effect varied with the extent of I. in a similar manner to that of the figural after-effect, although the amount of the effect was less than that of the latter. T. was underestimated when I. was equal to or larger than T. while it was overestimated when I. was smaller than T. (See Fig. 2)<BR>2. The amount of the retroactive-effect. varied not only with the exposure duration of I. but also with the time interval between T. and I. (See. Fig. 3 and 4).<BR>3. When T. and I. were presented simultaneously, the typical assimilation illusion of concentric circles was obtained, viz., T. was overestimated or underestimated according to whether it was smaller or larger than I. (See Fig. 5).<BR>4. The transition from the simultaneous effect to the figural after-effect or the retroactive-effect occurred at such a temporal interval where the impression of succession of T. and I. appeared on the part of subjects. (See Fig. 5 and Table 7).<BR>5. Even if I. was exposured 900 msec. later after the disappearance of T., the retroactive-effect was observed when the observers only with held their verbal reports with respect to the extent of T. until the disappearance of I.. However, if the verbal reports were made immediately after the exposure of T. and C., this effect became weak (See Table 4). These facts seem to suggest that the retroaction became effective through some complex processes involving not only perceptual process but also the memory trace.<BR>The results of the present investigation indicate that the adequate theory of the figural after-effect must take into consideration fhe retroaction and the simultaneous induction. © 1955, The Japanese Psychological Association.

AB  - Coefficient of slip for rough and smooth surfaces in air, determined by the constant deflection method.-The apparent coefficient of viscosity measured by this exceptionally precise method does not come out constant for the lower pressures unless correction is made for the slip at the surfaces. The relation ηp′(1+kζp)=η = constant, between ηp′, the apparent viscosity coefficient, and ζp, the coefficient of slip, enables ζp to be determined from measurements of ηp′ at pressures of 0.2 mm or lower. The apparatus included a vacuum-tight chamber inside which a cylinder of radius 5.341 cm was suspended by a steel wire concentric with a cylinder of radius 6.063 cm which could be rotated at a constant slow rate so as to cause a steady deflection of the inner cylinder. The accuracy of this method of measuring ηp′ is so great that the values of ζ76=ζpp76 all lie within ± 4 per cent of the mean. The chief difficulty was in keeping the air pure because of the gradual evolution of gas, probably hydrogen, inside the apparatus; but by taking observations only shortly after evacuation this effect was avoided. For brass surfaces, ζ, reduced to 23°and 76 cm, came out 66.15 × 10-7 which is practically the theoretical minimum deduced by Millikan for a completely diffusing surface, 65.9 × 10-7. For surfaces coated with shellac, the coefficient was found to be 97 × 10-7 for a fresh surface, in agreement with the value obtained by Lee from droplet measurements, but it decreased steadily with time, presumably because of a roughening due to oxidation, falling in two months to within 3 per cent of the theoretical minimum. The early part of this work was done in collaboration with E. L. Harrington. Coefficient of viscosity of air at 0.1 mm is the same as at atmospheric pressure when correction is made for the slip effect. The constancy of the values obtained for ζ provides new evidence that the coefficient is independent of the pressure. © 1923 The American Physical Society.

AB  - Lethe is one of the largest and pivotal genera in the family of Satyrid butterflies. Its wing pattern is shown to evolve from the Nymphaloid prototype established by one of the authors in 1924. This becomes evident first owing to the fact that of the 41 components which the prototype is built up 31 are discovered in the representatives of the genus. Secondly, several modifications of the prototype in Lethe are studied, which result in wide deviations of the respective patterns from the prototype. The following modifications should be noted as most interesting among them. The eye-spots may desintegrate into several irregular portions each. On the other hand, they may fuse with the Circuli surrounding them. Different dislocations are recorded in the stripes termed first and second Mediæ. Some of them, as the oblique dislocation of the first Media on the forewing and the so-called pierellisation of the second Media on the same, are met in other genera too. Meanwhile the beak-like dislocation of the hindwing first Media seems to be typical of the genus Lethe. The most complicated modification observed in Lethe is that termed podaliroid. It is composed of a number of dislocations, divisions, secondary fusions and other processes, which develop in the greater part of the pattern components with the result that in the final pattern the principal components become rectilinear, converge to some centres near the posterior margins of the wings, and the general appearance of the wings resembles in a way that of Papilio podalirius. An example of the Oudemans' phenomenon (Schwanwitsch, 1931) is recorded and a case of destructive action of one of the light interspaces upon the prototypical stripes and spots is described. © 1934.

AB  - The author examined the fibrous structure of the tympanic membrane in amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals under the microscope with a polaroid attachment. The conclusions were as follows: 1) The lamina propria of the tympanic membrane was composed of two groups of fibers, radial and non-radial. The radial fibers, could be found in all of the examined vertebrates. On the other hand, the non-radial fibers could be found in all vertebrates except some amphibians (Fig. 1). The arrangement of the non-radial fibers varied in different species, but had resemblance in a same species (Fig. 1∼10). 2) In mammals, the non-radial fibers consist of three sub-groups, circular, parabolic and transversal: The circular fibers could be divided into two types. In typeI, fibers ran in parallel with each other, while in typeII, fibers ran across to make network (Fig. 7, 14, 18). The mixture of those two types of arrangement of fibers was not observed. The parabolic fibers originated from the short process of the malleus and ran in parabolic courses forward and backward to the periphery of the tympanic membrane. The transversal fibers which were discovered in certain mammals in this study, were designated as the “transversal fiber” by the author. These fibers ran from one point in the periphery of the tympanic membrane to an opposite in the inferior area of the membrane, making arches with their concavity against the umbo (Fig. 9, 10, 20). 3) Secondi and Fumagalli discovered the “crescentic fiber” at the border of the tympanic membrane in some mammals. The crescentic fibers and the parabolic fibers were mentioned to make the “parabolic-crescentic system” (Fig. 11). Moreover, they mentioned that this system and the radial fibers were in a reciprocal balance, and with different position of the malleus, the degree of their bending would change, but not their tension. However, in this study the so-called “crescentic fiber” were not observed. Although small arches of fibers were regarded as the crescentic fibers at the border of the membranes in some mammals (ape and mankind), those fibers were confirmed to be the endings of the parabolic fib ers by the author (Fig. 12, Fig. 19, d). This indicates that the parabolic fibers transmit the acoustic vibration of the tympanic membrane to the short process of the malleus concentrically (Fig. 13). 4) According to the morophological observations above mentioned, the author assumed that the difference in the mode of vibration of the tympanic membrane depended upon the difference in the structure of the fibers of the tympanic membrane. This assumption was assertained in this study by means of a stroboscope (Fig. 15, 16). © 1959, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In August 1944, eyespot (Cercosporella herpotrichoides Fron.) was found in ninety out of 121 autumn‐sown wheat crops distributed over twelve Scottish counties. It was abundant enough in forty fields to be likely to harm subsequent crops, and was causing obvious loss in eleven crops. The disease was found in seventeen out of eighteen spring‐sown barley crops, more than half the straws being infected in seven of them. About 4 % of the wheat inspected was lodged mostly by eyespot and about 38 % of the barley mostly non‐parasitically. Eyespot increased with the frequency of wheat and barley in the two preceding years, but a few infected crops occurred on fields where no wheat or barley had been grown for many years. In Scotland, where the atmosphere is more humid, eyespot tends to increase more rapidly than in similar rotations in England; lesions are found higher up the straw and the disease is much more prevalent on spring‐sown barley. The long rotations practised in Scotland prevent more extensive damage by eyespot. Copyright © 1946, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - How the heart of the astronomer would rejoice if the scintillation of stars were due, as Prof. Hartridge1 considers possible, to physiological causes rather than to non-homogeneity of the earth's atmosphere! It is the practice of many observing astronomers, before 'opening up', to look at the sky and note, on some estimated scale, (i) the degree of clearness or transparency of the sky, and (ii) the degree of steadiness or goodness of seeing. (i) may be judged (in the absence of strong moonlight) by the limiting magnitude of stars just visible to the eye at various altitudes, and is important, in the case of photography, for judging exposure times; (ii) may be judged by the scintillation-frequency of the brightest stars; the greater the frequency the worse the 'seeing' will be. On the very best nights the stars appear nearly steady, the occasional winking being slow and infrequent. Such nights are suitable for measuring close binaries, the Airy disks and their diffraction ring systems appearing steady, often for many seconds together; on such nights, also, the finest planetary details are to be seen. When scintillation is conspicuous and rapid, the images of stars, viewed through a telescope, appear larger than the Airy disks and show a rapidly changing and uneven distribution of illumination. If the telescope is put out of focus, the star will appear as an illuminated disk showing, on a steady night, a number of fine concentric rings as in a 'zone plate'. On an unsteady night, rings are no longer visible, the whole disk appearing to 'boil'. It has been noted by British astronomers that both the scintillation and the telescopic images of stars are, in general, worse when the wind is in the east. Planets are only observed to scintillate when viewed at a low altitude on a night of exceptionally bad seeing. © 1950 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - A Debye-Scherrer camera has been designed to accommodate apparatus for maintaining the specimen at high or low temperatures. The specimen holder is at all times accessible, and the film holder is detachable. An apparatus has been devised for accurately controlling the temperature of the specimen between room temperature and -110°C. The specimen is enclosed in a chamber of still air, cooled externally by boiled liquid oxygen conducted between a succession of concentric cellophane windows. Special provision is made to prevent deposition of ice. Lattice spacing measurements of aluminium at temperatures down to -97.5°C. are in agreement with those calculated from the coefficient of expansion of the bulk metal.

AB  - A method of measuring quantitatively the degree of infection of a fungous disease of sugar cane called “eye spot” is described. The effect of the usual constituents of commercial fertilizers upon this disease has been determined by this method. It is first shown that the disease reaches a peak, or several peaks, of high infection during the winter months, when sunlight hours are at a minimum and there are consequent long periods of dew on the leaves, and when there is the greatest probability of continued rains in the Hawaiian Islands. With increased hours of sunlight and less rainfall in the summer months the amount of infection subsides abruptly. Some fields are more subject to the disease than others because of their topography. In an experiment with 10 replications of the plots of each fertilizer treatment, heavy applications of nitrogen (300 pounds per acre) were found to increase the numbers of infections, at the peak of the outbreak, 238 per cent as compared with plots having no nitrogen. Plots with moderate applications of nitrogen (65 pounds per acre) showed 77 per cent more infections than plots with no nitrogen. In a second experiment with 6 replications of the plots of each treatment, plots with high nitrogen showed, at the peak of the outbreak, 273 per cent more eye spot than plots with no nitrogen. Plots with moderate amounts of nitrogen showed 80 per cent more eye spot than the plots with no nitrogen. It is concluded that at the time of the year when conditions are favorable for infection applications of nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided in fields subject to this disease. The optimum time for the application of nitrogen fertilizers is in the months of April, May, June, and July, in the Hawaiian Islands. It is of significance that in the first experiment although nitrogen fertilizers did not give the growth response to the cane which phosphoric acid did, the cane showed a much greater reaction to eye spot in the nitrogen plots. In the second experiment nitrogen fertilizers gave no growth response to the cane, yet the nitrogen-treated plots showed much the greatest eye-spot reaction. Apparently, therefore, eye-spot infection is correlated, not with more vigorous growth, but with some physiological reaction of the cane produced by the nitrogen. In the first two experiments, at the peaks of infection, plots with no phosphoric acid showed more eye spot than plots with high phosphoric acid (400 pounds per acre. The experimental differences were not great enough to be considered significant, but at least it can be concluded that growth response in cane from phosphoric acid does not result in increased eye spot. In three separate experiments with adequate replications of the plots of each treatment, plots with no potash showed more infection at the peaks of the disease than plots with high applications of potash. The differences in the degree of infection were not great enough to be entirely significant but, being obtained so consistently, are highly suggestive that potash fertilizer applications result in slightly lessened infection. © 1928, American Chemical Society.

AB  - Heat dissipation is an ever-present factor affecting the design and operation of many kinds of electrical equipment. Usually, the problem is to get rid of heat due to losses. Sometimes the problem is how to conserve heat. Radiation, or convection, or conduction, or combinations of these, enter into all cases. Engineering literature as a rule presents conduction and convection in sound terms, but in many cases, the treatment of radiation is unsound, misleading, and sometimes in error. This paper is presented with the hope of putting heat radiation in engineering applications on a sounder basis. The usual laws given to cover total heat radiation are stated and discussed, and their limitations brought out. Net heat loss by radiation interchange for the cases of parallel and concentric surfaces are reviewed and stated. The problem of total radiation from a rectangular slot is attacked, the method of solution is indicated by example and discussion, and the results given. © 1930. By A. I. E. E.

AB  - 1. The fungus attacks leaves and sometimes twigs. The infected portions appear as concentric blotches. Three spore forms, viz., pycnia, æia and telia are present. 2. Pycnia are subhypodermal-flask shaped and orange yellow in colour. The paraphyses are exserted from the ostiole. 3. Aecia are developed on both the surfaces of the leaves, and are covered with well-developed peridia. Aeciospores are polyhydral and smooth-walled. A single germ pore becomes visible during germination. 4. Telia are amphigenous and are black in colour. Teliospore is stipitate, and two-celled. Spores germinate without a period of rest. The basidiospores are thin-walled, and uninucleate. Some abnormal types of germinations have been described. 5. Basidiospores infect the same host and form pycnia and æcia, and thus it is manifest that the fungus is autœcious. 6. Spore measurements and other considerations goes to show that Aecidium leiocarpum Syd. is the æcial stage of Puccinia leiocarpum (Syd.) Thirumalachar.

Sampathkumaran, m.a., ph.d., Professor of Botany, Central College, Bangalore, for guidance and encouragement in the course of this work, and to Dr. B. B.

AB  - Five hundred urinary calculi have been examined for direct or indirect evidence of radial striation. Such evidence is found in 42 per cent. of the calculi. Radial striation is limited to areas composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate, uric acid, or calcium acid phosphate dihydrate. It does not occur in areas of mixed composition. Radial striation is always associated with concentric lamination, but the reverse is not the case. Radial striation is shown by X‐ray diffraction techniques to be a consequence of the arrangement of the minute crystals which form the calculus; all the crystals tend to have a particular crystallographic direction radially placed in the calculus. In the case of calculi composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate the particular direction is the b crystallographic axis; in the case of calculi composed of calcium acid phosphate dihydrate it is the a crystallographic axis. The pathogenesis of radially striated calculi is developed from information on related concretions. The mucinous layer present on calculi is regarded as necessary for the development of this type of calculus: it allows diffusion of ionic groups but prevents disturbances in the process of crystallisation and so permits oriented growth to occur. The mucinous layer is continuously incorporated into the calculus as its “organic matrix.” Copyright © 1953, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The paper describes some features of the work of a special Service Committee set up by the Admiralty, for the purpose of standardizing drawing office practice in certain of their design departments. Basic principles are established for the guidance of designers and draughtsmen when preparing drawings for interchangeable components, and logical methods of approaching solutions to dimensional problems and of stating these on drawings are discussed. Particular attention has been paid to such problems as the best method of analysing, and dimensioning and applying tolerances to interchangeable components which involve tapered, concentric, or positional features such as holes and studs. Stress is laid upon the need for foreseeing, and avoiding as far as possible in the design stage, any special difficulties which may arise in practice in the construction of manufacturing equipment or of practical gauges for controlling the dimensions of components. It is understood that the British Standards Institution have in contemplation the preparation of a handbook dealing with the subject of the dimensioning of production drawings and of indicating the tolerances on them. Such a handbook, when completed, not only would be of great use to industry at large, but would also form a valuable textbook for courses of instruction to engineering students in technical colleges and universities. It is hoped that this paper may be the means of stimulating thought on this aspect of interchangeable manufacture and that it will provoke discussion which may lead to the development of a uniform system suitable for use both by Service Departments and by industry in general.
