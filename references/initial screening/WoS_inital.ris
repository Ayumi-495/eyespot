AB  - Background - Recent studies suggest that posttranslation processing or "shedding" (ie, secretion) of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme ( TACE) may contribute to the left ventricular (LV) remodeling that occurs in the failing human heart.
   Methods and Results - To address the functional significance of TNF shedding, we generated lines of transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of secreted wild-type (MHCsTNF2) TNF and overexpression of a mutated noncleavable transmembrane form of TNF (MHCmTNF). Both lines of mice had overlapping levels of myocardial TNF protein; however, the phenotypes of the MHCsTNF2 and MHCmTNF mice were strikingly disparate. Whereas the MHCmTNF mice developed a concentric LV hypertrophy phenotype, the MHCsTNF2 mice developed a dilated LV phenotype. The fibrillar collagen weave in MHCmTNF mice with concentric hypertrophy was characterized by thick collagen fibrils and increased collagen content, whereas the fibrillar collagen weave in the MHCsTNF2 mice with LV dilation was characterized by a diminished collagen content. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases with a broad-based matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor prevented LV dilation in the MHCsTNF2 mice.
   Conclusions - These findings suggest that posttranslational processing of TNF, as opposed to TNF expression per se, is responsible for the adverse cardiac remodeling that occurs after sustained TNF overexpression.

AB  - The extent of damage to the host plant caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) and var. graminis (Ggg) is a result of a net effect of host susceptibility and mycelium infectivity. The disease severity on cereal roots caused by G. graminis (Gg) fungi varies considerably depending on the genetic subtypes. Results of our rhizobox placement experiments additionally showed a subtype-specific effect of the spatial distance between host and fungus on the infection. The highest pathogenicity of each subtype was found in different zones of the root system: pathozones of different subtypes alternated along the root. The extent of the pathozone profiles did not depend on the infectivity of the inoculum and plant age. However, disease severity was shown to be affected by defence reactions of the host plant. An attack of a fungal subtype that is easily recognized by the host plant leads to defence reactions like increased root growth, thus minimizing the damage to the shoot. Detailed analysis showed that a Ggt subtype had a high potential for colonizing root laterals. It formed concentric zones of high colonization efficiency at a distance of ca. 5 cm around the shoot.

AB  - A new approach to computing a panoramic (360 degrees) depth map is presented in this paper. Our approach uses a large collection of images taken by a camera whose motion has been constrained to planar concentric circles. We resample regular perspective images to produce a set of multiperspective panoramas and then compute depth maps directly from these resampled panoramas. Our panoramas sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial distance, and vertical elevation. The use of multiperspective panoramas eliminates the limited overlap present in the original input images and, thus, problems as in conventional multibaseline stereo can be avoided. Our approach differs from stereo matching of single-perspective panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints are sine curves. For our multiperspective panoramas, the epipolar geometry, to the first order approximation, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo algorithm can be applied to multiperspective panoramas with little modification. In this paper, we describe two reconstruction algorithms. The first is a cylinder sweep algorithm that uses a small number of resampled multiperspective panoramas to obtain dense 3D reconstruction. The second algorithm, in contrast, uses a large number of multiperspective panoramas and takes advantage of the approximate horizontal epipolar geometry inherent in multiperspective panoramas. It comprises a novel and efficient 1 D multibaseline matching technique, followed by tensor voting to extract the depth surface. Experiments show that our algorithms are capable of producing comparable high quality depth maps which can be used for applications such as view interpolation.

AB  - The anatomical characteristics of Nectria canker on Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica were analyzed. Typical cankers were conspicuous, round to oval, with uniform concentric rings of affected xylem in a target-like structure. Each concentric annual growth ring was wider than the corresponding annual rings lateral to the cankers. The xylem elements were extremely disoriented. The cambial zone became discontinuous and disappeared. An inoculation test with the causal fungus, Nectria galligena, produced similar anatomical abnormalities and revealed the process of canker formation. Fewer and narrower vessels were formed, and water conduction took place only in the large vessels of the current year in the cankers.

AB  - Two familial cerebro-vascular diseases characterized by different cerebral arterial pathologies and presenting in non-hypertensive young and middle-aged adults are described. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by the deposition of smudged periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules known as granular osmiophilic materials (GOM) in the media of small arteries and arterioles. The medial smooth muscle cells are completely lost, and intense adventitial fibrosis is present. Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), or Maeda syndrome, is characterized by intense arteriolosclerosis without GOM deposition. Fibrous intimal proliferation, hyaline degeneration of the media, thickening and splitting of the internal elastic lamina, and concentric narrowing of the lumen are characteristic features. In PAS preparation, small arteries are occasionally stained homogeneously due to exudative changes, but never exhibit granular appearance in CARASIL (Maeda syndrome). Each of the small arterial changes is intense in the cerebral medullary and leptomeningeal arteries, leading to multifocal, confluent, or diffuse ischemic changes in the cerebrum. The authors suggest that CARASIL be referred to as 'Maeda syndrome' or 'CARASIL (Maeda syndrome)' to avoid confusion with CADASIL.

AB  - Character optimization methods can be used to reconstruct ancestral states at the internal nodes of phylogenetic trees. However, seldom are these ancestral states visualized collectively. Ancient Wings is a computer program that provides a novel method of visualizing the evolution of several morphological traits simultaneously. It allows users to visualize how the ventral hindwing pattern of 54 butterflies in the genus Bicyclus may have changed over time. By clicking on each of the nodes within the evolutionary tree, the user can see an animation of how wing size, eyespot size, and eyespot position relative the wing margin, have putatively evolved as a collective whole. Ancient Wings may be used as a pedagogical device as well as a research tool for hypothesis-generation in the fields of evolutionary, ecological, and developmental biology.

AB  - An improved version of the constant volume sampling (CVS) methodology that overcomes a number of obstacles that exist with the current CVS dilution tunnel system used in most diesel and gasoline vehicle emissions test facilities is presented. The key feature of the new sampling system is the introduction of dilution air immediately at the vehicle tailpipe. In the present implementation, this is done concentrically through a cylindrical air filter. Elimination of the transfer hose conventionally used to connect the tailpipe to the dilution tunnel significantly reduces the hydrocarbon and particulate matter (PM) storage release artifacts that can lead to wildly incorrect particle number counts and to erroneous filter-collected PM mass. It provides accurate representations of particle size distributions for diesel vehicles by avoiding the particle coagulation that occurs in the transfer hose. Furthermore, it removes the variable delay time that otherwise exists between the time that emissions exit the tailpipe and when they are detected in the dilution tunnel. The performance of the improved CVS system is examined with respect to diesel, gasoline, and compressed natural gas vehicles.

AB  - Communication among scientists must be clear and concise to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretations. The selection of words must be based on accepted definitions. The fields of biomechanics, muscle physiology, and exercise science have had a particularly difficult time with terminology, arising from the complexity of muscle contractions and by the use of inappropriate terminology by scientist. The dictionary definition of the verb "contract," specifically for the case of muscle, is "to undergo an increase in tension, or force, and become shorter." Under all circumstances, an activated muscle generates force, but an activated muscle generating force does not invariably shorten! During the 1920s and 1930s, investigators recognized that the interaction between the force generated by the muscle and load on the muscle results in either shortening, no length change (isometric), or lengthening of the muscle. The recognition that muscles perform three different types of "contractions" required that contraction be redefined as "to undergo activation and generate force." Modifiers of contraction are then needed to clarify the lack of movement of the directionality of movement. Despite the contradiction, for 75 years the lack of movement has been termed as "isometric contraction." The directionality of the movement is then best described by the adjectives "shortening" and "lengthening." The definitions of "concentric" as "having the same center" and of "eccentric" as "not having the same center" are consistent with hypertrophy, or remodeling of the heart muscle, but are inappropriate to describe the contractions of skeletal muscles.

AB  - Adenosine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms by activating A(1) adenosine receptors, probably by inhibiting excitatory amino acid release. Since blockade of A(2A) adenosine receptors seems to enhance dopaminergic striatopallidal transmission, we evaluated the role of the purinergic system in the opiate withdrawal syndrome by using two A(1) receptor agonists [N-6-cyclohexyladenosine, CHA and 2-chloro-N-6-cyclopentyladenosine, CCPA], and two A(2A) receptor antagonists (SCH 58261 and 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine, CSC).
   Male adult rats received increasing doses of morphine sulphate suspended in 5 ml/kg of a sustained release preparation (40-100 mg/kg s.c.) daily for 4 days and 20 h after the last administration, the withdrawal syndrome was evoked by naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.). Animals were observed for 30 min for signs of opiate withdrawal. Other groups of rats were implanted with concentric probes for microdialysis and dopamine levels were measured in the nucleus accumbens. CHA and CCPA (0.05, 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced 'wet-dog' shakes, diarrhoea, teeth chattering, jumping and writhing. SCH 58261 and CSC (0.1, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg i.p.), given 10 min before naloxone, also reduced signs of opiate withdrawal. CHA plus SCH 58261 and CCPA plus CSC greatly enhanced the reduction of withdrawal signs observed with CHA and CCPA or CSC and SCH 58261 alone. In vivo microdialysis showed that naloxone significantly decreased DA release; this effect was prevented by pretreatment with systemic SCH 58261 and CSC, but not with CHA and CCPA. Our results demonstrate that A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors mediate the effect induced by adenosine in opiate withdrawal syndrome and suggest that adenosine A(1) agonists and adenosine A(2A) antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of this syndrome.

AB  - Theory about the role of constraints in evolution is abundant, but few empirical data exist to describe the consequences a bias in phenotypic variation has for micro evolution. Responses to natural selection can be severely hampered by a genetic correlation among a suite of traits. Constraints can be studied using antagonistic selection experiments, that is, two-trait selection in opposition to this correlation. The two traits studied here were development time and wing pattern (eyespot size) in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, both of which have a clear adaptive significance. Rates of response were higher for eyespot size than for development time, but were independent of the concurrent selection (either in the same direction as the correlation or perpendicular to it), Regimes differed in both traits in all directions after I I generations of selection. The uncoupling lines had higher relative responses than the synergistic lines in development time and equal relative responses in eyespot size. The patterns for eyespot size (reaction norms) were consistent across different rearing temperatures. Differences in lines selected for fast and slow development time were more pronounced at lower temperatures, irrespective of the direction of joint wing pattern selection. Furthermore, correlated responses in pupal weight and growth rate were observed; lines selected for a slower development had higher pupal weights, especially at lower temperatures. The response of the uncoupling lines was not hampered by a lack of selectable genetic variation, and the relative response in the development time was larger than expected based on response in the coupled direction and quantitative genetic predictions. This suggests that the structure of the genetic architecture does not constrain the short-term, independent evolution of both wing pattern and development time.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is claimed both to provide a means of evaluating developmental stability, and to reflect an individual's quality or the stress experienced during development. FA refers to the nondirectional variation between left and right sides, whereas directional asymmetry (DA) refers to a significant directional variation between the sides. We studied four eyespots on the dorsal forewing of the tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. Two of the eyespots were specified by a mutant allele, Spotty, that was fixed in the stock. These eyespots showed higher FA than the two flanking, wild-type eyespots, although they are all formed by the same developmental pathway. We applied artificial selection for lower FA of the novel eyespots in an attempt to increase their developmental stability. There was significant variation present in individual FA in our study. However, this did not change as a result of the artificial selection. Most of the variation in FA can be accounted for by individual differences in developmental stability rather than by the applied selection or by environmental variation. Thus, it was not possible to produce any increased developmental stability of the novel eyespots by selecting for low FA. The estimates of realized heritability for both FA and DA of each eyespot were not significantly different from zero. The results suggest that FA provides little, if any, potential for exploring the mechanistic basis of developmental stability.

AB  - Host and habitat selection in flight by conifer bark beetles is governed by inhibition of attraction by non-host volatiles (NHV), in addition to the well-known attraction to kairomones from host plants and to aggregation pheromones from conspecifics. Antennally-active NHV from angiosperm birch and aspen trees were field tested on the European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.), by pheromone baited traps in Sweden using release rates of NHV comparable to those from a non-host tree. Trap catches were significantly reduced by 50-70% by individual NHV: trans-conophthorin, 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol from non-host bark, 1-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol from both leaves and bark and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol from leaves. Combined NHV signals in binary and ternary blends with the same overall release rates (ca 5 mg/day) showed both redundancy and synergism in their inhibitory effects. The redundancy occurred among individual green leaf alcohols (GLV-alcohols or C-6-alcohols), C-8-alcohols, and between these two groups, while trans-conophthorin and verbenone (Vn, from unsuitable host trees) showed significant synergistic effects between each other and with GLV-alcohols or C-8-alcohols. The coexistence of redundancy and synergism in non-host chemical signals may indicate different functional levels (non-host habitats, species, and unsuitable host trees) of these negative volatile signals in the host selection process of conifer bark beetles. We showed an active inhibitory range (AIR) of a NHV-blend plus Vn on a standard pheromone bait to be at least 2 m, by using a central pheromone trap and surrounding concentric barrier trap rings with radii of 1, 2, and 4 m. The influx of bark beetles flying across concentric rings within the AIR was reduced by 55-99%, depending on the distance to the central pipe trap. Our findings support the hypothesis that as mixed forests have greater semiochemical diversity than pure host stands; they disturb olfactory guided host choice, and may reduce the possibility of outbreaks of conifer-infesting bark beetles. The synergistic effects as well as the active inhibitory range found in this study also suggest that optimal combinations of these NHV and verbenone may have potential in protecting forests against L typographus by reducing or stopping attacks on suitable host trees. Mixed stands with higher semio-chemical diversity disturb olfactory guided host choice and reduce the risk for outbreaks of specialist herbivores. This 'semiochemical-diversity hypothesis' provides new support to the general 'stability-diversity hypothesis'.

AB  - Background: Loss of muscle strength and cross-sectional area is a well-recognized consequence of spaceflight. Existing countermeasures have not been fully effective in preventing muscle weakness and atrophy in microgravity. Resistance exercise programs that consist of both eccentric and concentric actions have resulted in strength and muscle mass gains in ground-based studies. Hypotheses: 1) A concentric/eccentric combination exercise regimen (with a bias of either concentric or eccentric exercise) will result in a greater strength gain than concentric exercise alone; and 2) an eccentrically biased regimen will result in the greatest strength gain of all. Methods: The 31 subjects were randomly assigned to one of three isokinetic exercise groups (CON-ECC: 75% concentric and 25% eccentric; ECC-CON: 75%, eccentric and 25% concentric; CON: 100% concentric); each subject trained the right leg 3 d per week for 5 wk. Pre- and post-training isokinetic concentric/ eccentric strength tests and DEXA scans assessed changes in muscle strength and/or mass. Results: All three groups showed an increase in eccentric muscle strength with the CON group showing the smallest gain (10.1%). Significantly larger gains were noted in the two combination groups (19.51%, 18.1'%; p < 0.042). with the largest gains in eccentric strength. No significant change was noted in muscle mass. Conclusions: A resistance exercise protocol which includes eccentric as well as concentric exercise, particularly when the eccentric exercise is emphasized, appears to result in greater strength gains than concentric exercise alone. Findings suggest eccentric exercise may be an important component of the in-flight resistance exercise protocol for long-duration spaceflight.

AB  - Developing organisms are thought to be modular in organization so that traits in different modules evolve independently whereas traits within a module change in a concerted manner. The eyespot pattern in Bicyclus anynana butterflies provides an ideal system where morphological modularity can be dissected and different levels of genetic integration analyzed. Several lines of evidence show that all eyespots in an individual butterfly are genetically integrated, suggesting that the whole pattern, rather than the separate eyespots, should be considered as a single character. However, despite the strong genetic correlations between the two eyespots on the dorsal forewing of B. anynana , there is great potential for independent changes. Here we use laboratory lines selected in different directions for the size of those eyespots to study correlated responses in the whole eyespot pattern. We show clear changes in eyespot size across all wing surfaces, which depend on eyespot position along the anterior-posterior axis. There are also changes in the number of extra eyespots and in eyespot color composition but no changes in eyespot position relative to wing margin. Our analysis of eyespot pattern modularity is discussed in the light of what is known about the cellular and genetic mechanisms of eyespot formation and the great potential for evolutionary diversification in butterfly wing patterns.

AB  - Aim. The interaction between running, stretching and practice jumps during warm-up for jumping tests has not been investigated. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of running, static stretching of the leg extensors and practice jumps on explosive force production and jumping performance.
   Methods. Sixteen volunteers (13 male and 3 female) participated in five different warm-ups in a randomised order prior to the performance of two jumping tests. The warm-ups were control, 4 min run, static stretch, run + stretch, and run + stretch + practice jumps. After a 2 min rest, a concentric jump and a drop jump were performed, which yielded 6 variables expressing fast force production and jumping performance of the leg extensor muscles (concentric jump height, peak force, rate of force developed, drop jump height, contact time and height/time).
   Results. Generally the stretching warm-up produced the lowest values and the run or run + stretch + jumps warm-ups produced the highest values of explosive force production. There were no significant differences (p<0.05) between the control and run + stretch warm-ups, whereas the run yielded significantly better scores than the run + stretch warm-up for drop jump height (3.2 %), concentric jump height (3.4 %) and peak concentric force (2.7 %) and rate of force developed (15.4 %).
   Conclusion. The results indicated that submaximum running and practice jumps had a positive effect whereas static stretching had a negative influence on explosive force and jumping performance. It was suggested that an alternative for static stretching should be considered in warm-ups prior to power activities.

AB  - The effects of reduced salinity on scallop, Pecten maximus, spat of 1.7 mm shell height and 31.5 mug ash free dry weight were studied at 15 and 18 degreesC. Mortality, growth, byssus attachment, activity behaviour and clearance rate were studied at salinities of 30, 25 and 20 for a period of 25 days. The mortality of scallops held in salinities of 30 and 25 at 18 degrees was 8%, which was significantly lower than for the spat kept at the other salinity-temperature combinations. Mean final mortalities at 15 degreesC were 59% for spat held at salinity of 20 and 25% for spat held at 25 and 30. At 18 degreesC and salinity of 20 final mortality was 26%. At salinity of 20, the increase in mortality rate commenced 1-2 weeks earlier at 15 degreesC than at 18 degreesC. Higher growth rates at temperature of 18 degreesC than at 15 degreesC were observed at salinities of 25 and 30. The shell of spat held in salinity of 20 became very thin and damaged easily, resulting in negative shell growth, while ash free dry weight growth was positive. No byssal attachments were observed in salinity of 20, and about 20% attachment occurred in 25. In salinity of 30 at 15 degreesC, the attachment rate decreased from 100% to 55%, while at 18 degreesC the attachment remained 83-97%. The general activity level was affected by low salinity as the foot movements decreased, the mantel retracted from the shell margin and gaping increased. Cultivation of scallop spat at sites influenced by brackish water (e.g., Norwegian polls) may result in high mortality when exposed to salinity lower than 25 and retarded growth may occur below 30. Locations exposed to salinities below 25 for an extended period should be avoided for nursery growth of P maximus spat. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper investigates the effects produced by the repetition of seismic events on steel structures. Two moment resistant frames with different number of floors and rigid joints, two frames with semirigid joints and a concentrically braced frame have been analysed under repeated seismic events of medium-strong intensity. Obtained results highlight that the seismic responses are characterised by a significant decrease in the behaviour factor with respect to only one event. These effects should be then taken into account in sites where such a type of event may occur, in order to avoid an excessive structural damage.

AB  - Examples of adaptive radiation by Darwinian evolution will always enthral, and the theory of natural selection binds the whole of biology. But is selection all-powerful? Evolutionary developmental biology is beginning to provide the background to understanding how the internal organisation of organisms can influence the tempo and direction of evolutionary change. Do the mechanisms that generate the phenotype channel, bias or limit morphological evolution? The formation of eyespots on the wings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana is a process which is becoming comparatively well understood from the genetical, developmental and ecological perspectives. We have begun to combine this knowledge with artificial selection experiments to examine the rates at which morphological changes of a particular eyespot pattern in different directions can be achieved. Our initial selection experiment performed over twenty-five generations has shown that in contrast to predictions based on shared genetical and developmental properties, two butterfly eyespots on the same wing surface can be freely uncoupled from each other with respect to their pattern of relative sizes. This flexibility in development and in response to selection may occur because our base population is part of a lineage with a long legacy of natural selection building up genetic variation that enables independent behaviour for eyespot size, and thus it no longer reflects a tightly modular organisation of eyespots as may well have existed close to their evolutionary origin in basal Lepidoptera. Comparisons can be made between such descriptions of the potential for short-term changes in morphology in B. anynana and observed patterns of divergence among all extant species in this species-rich genus. Being able to map phenotypes onto genotypes via developmental processes provides a powerful basis for exploring genetical and developmental constraints. This will eventually lead to examples of evolutionary constraints that represent more than 'just-so' stories, and thus to a more balanced view of Darwinian evolution.

AB  - Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) follows unaccustomed muscular exercise, most notably in the eccentric mode. That concept refers to a dull ache combined with tenderness, stiffness and weakness of the previously active muscles. lsokinetic device constitutes a specific model in generating and investigating DOMS. Respective effects of concentric and eccentric actions have been compared, emphasizing on the variability in the response (serum activity of CK for instance). The particular sensitivity of the hamstrings was underlined although causes remained unexplained. Some treatment have been proposed in the management of DOMS. Several studies reported that anti-inflammatory agents fail to alleviate pain and discomfort even if other authors indicated a relative effectiveness. Based on the repeated-bout effect, submaximal eccentric exercise currently represent the most useful preventive strategy.

AB  - The Gemini Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) will be used with the ALTAIR adaptive optics system on Gemini North. NIFS uses a reflective, concentric, integral field unit (IFU) to reformat its focal plane. The concentric IFU design integrates the IFU with the spectrograph collimator to form a dedicated IFU instrument. The IFU channels are identical and fanned about a single axis passing through the image slicer. The spherical optical surfaces of the spectrograph collimator are all concentric and centered on this fanning axis. The grating is also located on the fanning axis, and the system is arranged to produce coincident pupil images at the grating. In this way, each channel of the IFU performs as if it is on-axis. This avoids complications due to off-axis angles that are intrinsic to other reflective IFU designs.

AB  - The author presents 'Existential Technology' as a new category of in(ter)ventions and as a new theoretical framework for understanding privacy and identity. His thesis is twofold: (1) The unprotected individual has lost ground to invasive surveillance technologies and complex global organizations that undermine the humanistic property of the individual; (2) A way for the individual to be free and collegially assertive in such a world is to be 'bound to freedom' by an articulably external force. To that end, the author explores empowerment via self-demotion. He has founded a federally incorporated company and appointed himself to a low enough position to be bound to freedom within that company. His performances and in(ter)ventions over the last 30 years have led him to an understanding of such concepts as individual self-corporatization and submissivity reciprocity for the creation of a balance of bureaucracy.

AB  - The Luneburg lens (LL) represents a very attractive candidate for many applications such as multibeam antennas, multifrequency scanning, and spatial scanning, due to its focusing properties. Indeed, it is a dielectric sphere on which each surface point is a frequency-independent perfect focusing point. This is produced by its index governing law n, which follows the radial distribution n(2)=2r(2), where r is the normalized radial position. Practically, LL is manufactured as a finite number of concentric homogeneous dielectric shells-this is called a discrete LL. The inaccuracies in the curved shell manufacturing process produce intershell air gaps, which degrade the performance of the lens. Furthermore, this requires different materials whose relative dielectric constant covers the range 1-2. To avoid these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new LL manufacturing process. The paper is dichotomized into two main parts: the theoretical background and the performance of the obtained lens.

CP  - 4th International Conference on Behaviour of Steel Structures in Seismic Areas (Stessa 2003)
KW  - LOW-RISE
AB  - This paper presents a method which is proposed to predict the design axial forces for zipper columns used in chevron steel bracing. This method is based on traditional capacity design principles and on examination of the seismic response of chevron bracing systems with zipper columns. It aims at maintaining the zipper column elastic under severe earthquake ground motions so that a complete plastic mechanism can develop in the structure, thereby preventing storey mechanisms resulting from a concentration of the inelastic demand along the building height. The design procedure was applied to a sample 8-storey frame and nonlinear time step dynamic analyses were performed to examine the frame response under ordinary and near-fault ground motions. The computed peak axial forces in the zipper column were found to vary with the ground motion type. They were well predicted by the proposed method, although the compression forces from the analyses were generally lower than those anticipated for the frame studied.

AB  - Purpose: To test whether active and passive warm-up conducted before eccentric exercise attenuates clinical markers of muscle damage. Methods: Untrained subjects were exposed to one of five conditions: low-heat passive warm-up (N = 10), high-heat passive warm-up (N = 4), or active warm-up (N = 9), preceding eccentric exercise; eccentric exercise without warm-up (N = 10); or high-heat passive warm-up without eccentric exercise (N = 10). Passive warm-up of the elbow flexors was achieved using pulsed short-wave diathermy, and active warm-up was achieved by concentric contraction. Creatine kinase (CK) activity, strength, range of motion, swelling, and muscle soreness were observed before treatment (baseline) and 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after treatment. Results: High-heat passive warm-up without eccentric exercise did not affect any marker of muscle damage and was used as our control group. Markers of muscle damage were not different between groups that did or did not conduct warm-up before eccentric exercise. The active warm-up and eccentric groups exhibited a greater circumferential increase than controls (P < 0.0002), however, that was not observed after passive warm-up. Additionally, the active warm-up group exhibited a greater CK response than controls at 72 h (P < 0.05). The high-heat passive warm-up before eccentric exercise group exhibited significant change from controls at the least number of time points, but due to a small sample size (N = 4), these data should be viewed as preliminary. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that passive warm-up performed before eccentric exercise may be more beneficial than active warm-up or no warm-up in attenuating swelling but does not prevent, attenuate, or resolve more quickly the other clinical symptoms of eccentric muscle damage as produced in this study.

AB  - There is growing interest in building predictive models of species distributions over large geographic areas. As larger areas are modelled, however, it is highly likely that heterogeneity in the predictors variable increases and that areas are included where animals respond to habitats in different ways, for example, due to social status. These effects (spatial non-stationary) may weaken model performance. This paper explores whether data partitioning prior to analysis can improve the tit of models and provide ecological insight into distribution patterns. Data on three bird species were modelled for the whole of Spain at 1 km(2) resolution using logistic regression analysis. Data were partitioned into geographic quarters, concentric rings around the centroid of the distribution, and into random samples for comparison. In all cases, data partitioning produced better models as assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) statistics than analysis of the global data set. Inclusion of latitude and longitude improved the global models only when added as smoothed splines but produced different probabilities to the partitioned data. Geographic partitioning is a very crude local modelling approach and we suggest that some form of geographically-weighted regression could offer the best solution to large-scale modelling but is computationally intensive on Geographical Information Systems (GIs) data. It is concluded that simple partitioning by geographic quarters may detect spatial non-stationary and alert the modeller to possible problems; that partitioning into more novel arrangements may be used to test ecological hypotheses; and that data should not be partitioned spatially to build and test models if non-stationary is suspected.

AB  - The induction and termination of pupal diapause of Helicoverpa armigera were examined in three local populations from Kagoshima, Okayama and Ishikawa, in Japan. Pupae in diapause retained eyespots for much longer than non-diapause pupae, and for markedly diverse durations. Once eyespots disappeared at the end of diapause, the period required for development until eclosion was more or less constant at 18degreesC. In all experiments repeated twice under the same conditions, male pupae generally showed a high tendency to enter diapause while female pupae showed a slight and rather population-specific tendency towards diapause. This trait as well as the higher intensity of male pupal diapause and the shorter post-diapause period of females suggest that females emerge first in the field in spring. This feature was regarded to be potentially important for considering the life-history strategy of this cosmopolitan pest.

AB  - Modularity in animal development is thought to have facilitated morphological diversification, but independent change of those traits integrated within a module might be restricted. Correlations among traits describe potential developmental constraints on evolution. These have often been postulated to explain patterns of morphological variation and have been examined theoretically but seldom analyzed experimentally. Here, we use artificial selection to explore the modular organization of butterfly wing patterns and the extent to which their evolution is constrained by the genetic correlations among repeated pattern elements. We show that, in Bicyclus anynana butterflies, despite the evidence that all eyespots are developmentally coupled, the response to selection for increased size of one individual eyespot can proceed in a manner largely independent from selection imposed on another eyespot. We argue that among-eyespot correlations are unlikely to have constrained the evolutionary diversification of butterfly wing patterns but might be important when only limited time is available for adaptive evolution to occur. The ease with which we have been able to produce independent responses to artificial selection on different eyespots may be linked to a legacy of natural selection favoring individuality. Our results are discussed within the context of the evolution of modularity and individuality of serially repeated morphological traits.

AB  - Carbohydrate ingestion increases both endurance time to exhaustion during prolonged exercise, and the ability to perform resistance exercise. The mechanism(s)underlying the increased performance following glucose ingestion remain (s) unclear. The purpose of the present study was to verify the hypothesis that glucose infusion could attenuate peripheral muscle fatigue in the anaesthetized rat during prolonged indirect electrical stimulation in situ. For this purpose the plantaris muscle was electrically stimulated (50 Hz for 200 ms every 2.7 s; 5 V; pulse width, 0.05 ms) in situ through the sciatic nerve to perform concentric contractions for 60 min while infusing intravenously either saline alone (7.25 ml kg(-1) h(-1)), or saline and glucose (1 g kg(-1) h-(1:) plasma glucose 11+/-1.1, vs. 4.9+/-0.2 mM with infusion of saline) (8 rats per group). Glucose infusion attenuated the reduction in submaximal. peak dynamic force (55% decrease vs. 70% decrease in rats infused with saline alone, P<0.05). In a third group of rats (n=8), infusion of glucose 30 min after the start of stimulation partially restored submaximal peak dynamic force (P<0.05). Maximum dynamic and isometric forces at the end of the period of stimulation were also higher (P<0.05) in rats infused with glucose (4.0 +/- 0.2 and 4.3 +/- 0.2 N, respectively) than saline alone (3.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.5 +/- 0.2 N, respectively). The beneficial effect of glucose infusion on peripheral muscle force during prolonged stimulation was not associated with a reduction in muscle glycogen utilisation, nor with a reduction of fatigue at the neuromuscular junction, as assessed through maximal direct muscle stimulation (200 Hz for 200 ms; 150 V; pulse width, 0.05 ms). However, changes in M-wave peak-to-peak amplitude, duration and total area suggest that glucose infusion, and/or the associated increase in plasma insulin concentration, may prevent the deterioration of electrical properties of the muscle fibre membrane.

AB  - Background Stent design causes the differences of restenosis rate, but the morphological differences after the various types of stent implantation have not been clarified.
   Design Seven types of stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries to clarify how the mechanism of restenosis differs with coil stents and tube stents.
   Methods The left anterior descending coronary arteries (LADS) of pigs were injured using coronary angioplasty balloons (diameter: 3.0 mm; length: 20 mm; balloon/artery ratio: 1 : 2). Fourteen days after the injury, four types of coil stents (Cordis, Wiktor, GR-I, and GR-II) and three types of tube stents (Palmaz-Schatz, gfx, and Multilink) were implanted, and the LADS were extracted 28 days after the implantation.
   Results The proliferated neointima was eccentric in the coil stents and concentric in the tube stents. Although there was no significant difference in the area of neointima, the area of the lumen was significantly larger in the tube stents than in the coil stents (P < 0.01) because of the larger area of stent. Cells positive for anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody were mainly observed around the stent struts, and most of these cells were also positive for either anti-macrophage or anti-smooth muscle actin antibodies.
   Conclusions Compared to the coil stents, the tube stents induce less negative remodelling including stent recoil, resulting in a wider luminal area. In order to prevent restenosis, it is crucial to implant a stent that will cause less negative remodelling.

AB  - Mobility, activity patterns, habitat use, and some morphological traits of two often cooccurring satyrine butterflies of grasslands-the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) and the hedge brown (Pyronia tithonus)-were studied by a mark-release-recapture method at two sites. Additionally, someflight-related morphological traits of a series of collected females of P. tithonus were compared between recently colonized and permanent populations. The more active, but less mobile P. tithonus got faster wing damage than did M. jurtina and had more, and more symmetrically spread eyespots onthe wings. For both species, the microdistribution was affected by shelter, long vegetation, and nectar, but this was more pronounced in P. tithonus. It is hypothesized that P. tithonus may traverse the same landscape at a slower rate than M. jurtina.

AB  - The eyespots on the ventral wings of Bicyclus anynana butterflies are exposed when at rest and interact with predators. Those on the dorsal surface are not exposed in this way, and may be involved in courtship and mate choice. In this study, we examined whether the size and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of dorsal eyespots are reliable signals of male quality. High developmental stability is considered to result in low FA, and to be associated with high quality. Individuals of high quality are predicted to produce sexually selected traits that are large and symmetrical, at a relatively low cost. In this study, we manipulated eyespot development to uncouple eyespot size and FA in order to examine their independent roles in signalling to the female. Individual females in cages were given the choice between two or three males differing in eyespot traits. The results indicate that although size per se of the eyespots is used as a signal, FA and wing size are not. We discuss the use of FA in studies of sexual selection and aspects of sexual selection on dorsal eyespot size.

AB  - Cold production is a non-thermal process in which sand is intentionally produced with oil in order to enhance oil recovery. In order to develop a full numerical model using a reservoir simulator, of the cold production process, it is necessary to know the effect of producing large quantities of sand on the overall permeability of the formation. A pressure depletion experiment was performed in order to simulate the production of sand, oil and gas into perforations in a well and within the formation during the cold production process. A numerical simulation of the flow of oil and gas into the orifices before sand production was used to calculate the pressure gradient at the orifices. A significant interference effect was observed during wormhole growth in the sand pack saturated with live oil with two vertically aligned orifices at one end. A sand-filled channel (wormhole) 36 cm in length by 17 cm in diameter developed from the top orifice, whereas only a small sand-filled cavity developed from the bottom orifice. The calculated pressure gradient at the top orifice at the onset of sand production (7.5 MPa/m) was slightly higher than at the bottom orifice (7.1 MPa/m). The growth of the top wormhole decreased the pressure gradient at the bottom orifice and therefore prevented the growth of a bottom wormhole. The experiment suggests that wormholes do not develop from each perforation in a well. The flow of oil and gas at the surface of a stationary wormhole, similar in size to the top wormhole, was modeled numerically for two different boundaries: (1) a 30-cm diameter, 80-cm long sand pack, and (2) an 80-cm oil sand hemisphere. The calculated pressure gradients at the surface of the wormhole within the 80-cm sand hemisphere were one order of magnitude larger than the pressure gradients at the surface of the wormhole within the sand pack. These simulations suggest that the diameter of wormholes in the field is significantly greater than 17 cm. The wormhole was composed of a central channel of loose sand surrounded by concentric tensile failure bands. These tensile failure bands likely weaken the sand at the surface of the wormhole and allow it to be produced more easily. This weakening effect would explain the lower pressure gradients calculated at the surface of the wormhole compared to the critical pressure gradient for sand production predicted by Bratli and Risnes [SPE J. (April 1981) 236]. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Concentric intimal thickening and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in cardiac allografts are the pathological hallmark characteristics of chronic vascular rejection (CVR), the leading cause of long-term graft failure. The precise mechanisms involved in the development and pathogenesis of CVR remain elusive. In the PVG-R23 to PVG-RTIu rat model of CVR, prior administration of a donor-specific transfusion (DST) was previously shown to prolong graft survival indefinitely and abolish the vascular lesions associated with CVR. The present study investigates in more depth the underlying mechanisms involved in the subsequent prolongation of allograft survival and inhibition of CVR by DST.
   Methods. R23 heart grafts were monitored in non-transfused and transfused RT1(u) recipients injected 2 weeks before transplantation with 1.5 ml of R23 blood. Severity of arteriosclerosis, transplant infiltrate, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 protein expression within the graft, plasma TGF-beta1 levels, class 11 MHC expression, tenascin protein expression, and serum alloantibody levels were measured.
   Results. There was no significant difference in donor MHC class 11, myocardial TGF-beta1, or tenascin expression between DST and non-DST-treated recipients. However, DST-pretreated recipients showed greatly reduced histological evidence of CVR and had lower titers of R23-specific IgG subclasses. Furthermore, DST-treated allograft recipients showed significant decreases in circulating TGF-beta1 levels and a reduction in TGF-beta1 and tenascin expression within coronary arteries of the allografts.
   Conclusion. The results suggested that DST inhibited CVR by altering and regulating the expression of TGF-beta1, thereby preventing the fibrogenie effects associated with TGF-beta1.

AB  - Tetrasporogenesis in Osmundea spectabilis (Postels and Ruprecht) K.W. Nam var. spectabilis proceeds through three developmental stages. A uninucleate tetraspore mother cell with synaptonemal complexes depicted during early prophase of meiosis I comprises the youngest stage. Subsequently, the nuclear envelope obtains a highly irregular profile and is surrounded by perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and numerous mitochondria. Proplastids with peripheral thylakoid and numerous straight-profiled dictyosomes are present. Dictyosome vesicles discharge their contents, initiating tetraspore wall formation. A four-nucleate tetraspore mother cell is formed prior to tetrahedral cleavage. During the second stage of tetraspore formation the nuclei are very irregular in outline and move toward the central region where they fuse. The formation of fibrous vacuoles originates from the fibrous vacuole associated organelles (FVAOs). Thylakoid formation from concentric lamellar bodies (CLBs) seems to occur in plastids. Extremely hypertrophied dictyosomes with two tightly compressed and densely laminated mid-regions produce vesicles which contribute to enlargement of the fibrous vacuoles. During the second stage of tetraspore development striated vesicles are formed and starch granule formation increases. Mature tetraspores are characterized by numerous cored vesicles and abundant starch granules. Plastids have a fully developed system of internal thylakoids, and cleavage is usually complete at this stage. Mature tetraspores are surrounded by a bi-layered wall and the tetrasporangial wall. Unbranched, tubular structures connecting the plasmalemma with the peripheral sheets of ER are possibly involved in wall deformation. A distinct blebbing nuclear envelope appears to sequester vesicles into the cytoplasm.

KW  - SPANDRELS
AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology has encouraged a change of research emphasis from the sorting of phenotypic variation by natural selection to the production of that variation through development(1). Some morphologies are more readily generated than others, and developmental mechanisms can limit or channel evolutionary change(2). Such biases determine how readily populations are able to respond to selection(3), and have been postulated to explain stasis in morphological evolution(4) and unexplored morphologies(5). There has been much discussion about evolutionary constraints(6-8) but empirical data testing them directly are sparse(9,10). The spectacular diversity in butterfly wing patterns(11) is suggestive of how little constrained morphological evolution can be. However, for wing patterns involving serial repeats of the same element, developmental properties suggest that some directions of evolutionary change might be restricted(12,13). Here we show that despite the developmental coupling between different eyespots in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, there is great potential for independent changes. This flexibility is consistent with the diversity of wing patterns across species and argues for a dominant role of natural selection, rather than internal constraints, in shaping existing variation.

AB  - Feathers are complex, branched keratin structures that exhibit a diversity of pigmentation patterns. Feather pigments are transferred into developing feather keratinocytes from pigment cells that migrate into the tubular feather germ from the dermis. Within-feather pigment patterns are determined by differential pigmentation of keratinocytes within independent barb ridges during feather development. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine which keratinocytes receive pigment. We apply reaction-diffusion models to the growth of within-feather pigment patterns based on a realistic model of feather growth. These models accurately simulate the growth of a diversity of the within-feather pigmentation patterns found in real feathers, including a central patch, a 'hollow' central patch, concentric central patches, bars, chevrons, a central circular spot, rows of paired spots, and arrays of offset dots. The models can also simulate the complex transitions between distinct pigmentation patterns among feathers observed in real avian plumages, including transitions from bars to chevrons, bars to paired dots, and bars to arrays of dots. The congruence between the developmental dynamics of the simulated and observed feather patterns indicates that the reaction-diffusion models provide a realistic and accurate description of the determination of pigment pattern within avian feather follicles. The models support the hypothesis that within-feather pigmentation patterning is determined by antagonistic interactions among molecular expression gradients within the tubular follicle and feather germ.

AB  - We determined the frequency of strength disorders in 26 athletes with a history of hamstring muscle injury and recurrent strains and discomfort. We also assessed the effectiveness of rehabilitation to correct muscle performance. After concentric and eccentric isokinetic assessment, 18 athletes were found to have strength deficits, as determined by statistically selected cutoffs of peak torque, bilateral differences, and the flexors/quadriceps ratio. The discriminating character of the eccentric trial was demonstrated, combining a preferential eccentric peak torque deficit and a significant reduction of the mixed eccentric flexors/concentric quadriceps ratio. The athletes with muscle imbalances followed a rehabilitation program individually adapted from their strength profile. Treatment length was from 10 to 30 sessions and resulted in isokinetic parameter normalization in 17 of 18 subjects. Isokinetically corrected subjects were observed for 12 months after return to athletics. None sustained a clinically diagnosed hamstring muscle reinjury. Subjective intensity of pain and discomfort were significantly reduced, and they all returned to their prior level of competition. These results demonstrate that persistent muscle strength abnormalities may give rise to recurrent hamstring injuries and discomfort. An individualized rehabilitation program emphasizing eccentric training based on specific deficits contributes to a decrease in symptoms on return to sports.

AB  - The present review examines epidemiological evidence for a relation of left ventricular hypertrophy with coronary heart disease, and mechanisms that may represent pathophysiological links between left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary events. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been demonstrated to be a powerful predictor of coronary heart disease, and when geometry is concentric the relation is even stronger. In addition to its association with risk factors for atherosclerosis and mechanisms that precipitate acute heart attacks, left ventricular hypertrophy also directly predisposes to and aggravates clinical presentation of coronary heart disease through a number of biological mechanisms. These include the following: increase in oxygen requirement related to left ventricular geometry; coronary hypertension, with endothelial dysfunction and reduced coronary reserve; diastolic dysfunction; and structural remodelling of myocardium and vascular bed. Some of these alterations are also worsened by underlying coronary heart disease, and can potentially be maintained by loop mechanisms. A recognizable stage of abnormal coronary haemodynamics in the context of left ventricular hypertrophy is probably that at which coronary reserve is impaired in the absence of any other sign of heart disease; in many circumstances, this may occur early in the disease process.

AB  - The tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows phenotypic plasticity in its ventral wing pattern as an adaptive response to wet-dry seasonality. Wet season form individuals have large eyespots, whereas individuals of the dry season generation have small eyespots. In the laboratory these forms can be Obtained by rearing larvae at high and low temperatures, respectively. To study the extent to which the shape of the nearly linear reaction norms for eyespot size can be changed we applied four generations of sib selection by rearing full-sib families across three temperatures. in addition, we measured ecdysteroid titres shortly after pupation in the final generation. Although phenotypic variation in shape was present initially, the experiment yielded lines with reaction norms with similar shapes but different elevations. High, positive genetic correlation across temperatures can explain this lack of response. Differences in ecdysteroid titres did not readily relate to differences in eyespot size.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of air bubbles on mineral fouling in a heat exchanger with a cooling-tower water. Two different tests were conducted in a concentric-tube heat exchanger at 12 cycles of concentration: no-treatment, and a physical water treatment (PWT). A small flow velocity of 0.83 m/s and a high heat flux of 22.5x10(4) W/m(2) were chosen to accelerate the fouling in the heat exchanger. Air bubbles from the cooling water adhered to the heat-transfer surface made of a smooth copper tube, significantly affecting the overall fouling process. The fouling started from the heat-transfer surface covered by the air bubbles and then spread around the area not covered by the bubbles. The fouling resistance in the case with PWT was approximately 27% less than that in the no-treatment case, indicating that the PWT could be useful in mitigating mineral fouling even in the case of a low flow velocity where air bubbles adversely affect the fouling process.

AB  - Aim The geographical distributions of animal and plant species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were analysed to locate and designate areas of endemicity.
   Location The Iberian Peninsula and the three largest Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza) in the western Mediterranean, West Palaearctic region.
   Methods The information analysed consisted of presence/absence data of animal and plant species, recorded on a 100 x 100 km grid based on the UTM projection system. From a larger initial data set, a simplified matrix of 480 species present in at least two quadrats was obtained, and processed to estimate the overall similarity patterns across land squares, and the areas of endemism. Two methods were employed to detect areas of endemism: Wagner Parsimony (PAE, or parsimony analysis of endemicity) and compatibility. A modification of PAE, PAE-PCE (Parsimony analysis of endemicity with progressive character elimination) was applied to overcome some of the potential shortcomings of the method.
   Results The results represent the first attempt for a combined analysis of animal and plant distributions in the western Mediterranean. The proposed PAE-PCE procedure proved useful to identify areas of endemism that would have been otherwise overlooked. Up to thirty-six different areas of endemisms were identified. Some of these represent concentric (hierarchically nested) structures, while other are partly overlapping sectors. The endemism areas, as derived from parsimony and compatibility analyses, generally fit within the frame of the overall similarity approach.
   Main conclusions The areas of endemicity identified often coincide with mountain sectors, and this may be of incidental interest for conservation policies as most natural preserves in the study area are located in mountain ranges. The conclusions are of interest for large scale approaches to the biogeography of the Mediterranean Basin, facilitating the selection of endemism areas for operative purposes. However, most of the best supported areas of endemism detected are relatively small, or overlap with neighbouring endemism areas. Hence, adopting large area units such as 'Iberia' for historical analysis at a wider geographical scale may be risky, because such units may actually represent composite sectors of an heterogeneous nature. The distribution of the areas of endemism, as well as the results of the overall similarity classification, share a number of features with previous sectorizations from independent, mostly phytogeographical, approaches. Parsimony analysis of endemicity is a potentially useful tool for identifying areas designated by species with congruent distributions, but (1) the results have no direct historical implications (for phylogenetic information is not incorporated), and (2) unless modifications such as the PAE-PCE procedure are applied, the number of potential areas of endemism (in the sense stated above) will often be underestimated. It is also shown that, in a PAE, a 'total evidence' approach is to be preferred to a consensus of partial (taxon-specific) results.

AB  - Naturally occurring veinless specimen of the swallowtail Papilio xuthus show an extremely aberrant colour pattern. In spite of the fact that we have no breeding data, these veinless specimen are provisionally called veins-reduced mutant. In these mutants seven longitudinal veins of the fore wing and five of the hind wing are absent, The absence of wing veins is associated with a loss of the broad black venous stripes that normally are present along the proximal portion of the veins. In addition, missing veins cause a loss of the dislocation of black bands in adjacent wing cells, so that what are discrete black segments in normal wings become continuous bands in the veinless wing. Computer simulations show that the morphology of the striped patterns on both the veinless and veined wing can be explained if the wing margin acts as an inductive source of pattern formation and the veins act simply as boundaries to the propagation of the signal from the wing margin. The vein-dependent patterns by contrast, require that the veins act as inductive sources, at least along their proximal portion. This dual role of wing veins is consistent with prior observations on the biology of colour pattern formation. The unique veinless colour pattern strongly supports the hypothesis that the wing margin is the dominant organiser of colour pattern in this species, and possibly in other Papilionidae.

AB  - We have investigated the nature of highly ordered bivalent arrangement in lepidopteran spermatocytes by analysing and comparing the patterns of bivalent distribution in intact metaphase I plates of 24 closely related species of the genus Agrodiaetus (Lycaenidae). The studied species greatly differed in haploid chromosome numbers (from n=13 to n=90) and in the structure of their karyotypes. We found that the larger the bivalent, the closer to the centre of the metaphase plate it was situated. In species with a high chromosome number and asymmetrical karyotype structure, the largest bivalent was located in the centre of the circular metaphase plate. Bivalents of equal size were approximately equidistant from the centre of the metaphase plate and formed concentric circles around the largest bivalent. These principles are diametrically different from those known in the majority of other animals and plants, in which the smallest elements of the chromosome set are situated in the centre of metaphase plate. The only exception from the above principles was observed in spermatocytes of A. surakovi which were heterozygous for reciprocal translocation involving two or three chromosome pairs. In addition to one large bivalent, the heterozygous cells had a multivalent, the size of which was comparable to or even exceeded that of the largest bivalent in the karyotype. In spite of the large size, the multivalent was always situated at the periphery of metaphase plate. This indicated that the chromosome size itself is not the only factor determining the bivalent position. We also found that the structure of the metaphase plate is fundamentally different in mitotic and meiotic cells of Agrodiaetus. In spermatogonial metaphase, chromosomes were tightly brought together, forming a dense compact disk, whereas during metaphase I of spermatocytes, all bivalents were clearly separated from each other, and the distance between adjacent bivalents varied from 0.4 to 1.5 mum. Based on the above findings, we proposed a model of bivalent distribution in the Lepidoptera. According to the model, during congregation in the prometaphase stage there is a centripetal movement of bivalents made by a force directed to the centre of the metaphase plate transverse to the spindle. This force is proportional to the kinetochore size of a particular bivalent. The Lepidoptera have a special near-holokinetic type of chromosome organisation. Therefore, large bivalents having large kinetochores are situated in the central part of metaphase plate. Another possible factor affecting the bivalent position is the interaction of bivalents with the cisternae of the membrane system compartmentalising the intraspindle space.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the isokinetic ratio of the knee joint according to the playing position of the soccer players. Two groups of soccer players were formed. The first group was subdivided according to a horizontal division of the field (defenders, midfielders, attackers) and the second group was subdivided according to the vertical division of the field (axial and lateral players). Both groups performed concentric and eccentric isokinetic tests at 60 and 120degrees.s(-1). "Functional" ratios were calculated using peak torque and mean strength moments. Functional ratios in the horizontal axis did not demonstrate a significant difference between the positions for either speed, either muscular group or either contraction mode. In the vertical axis of the field, the ratio recorded at 60degrees.s(-1) showed a significant difference with the ratio recorded at 120degrees.s(-1), except for the ratio of the lateral players which was calculated using the mean strength moments. These results reflect the musculo-ligamentary adaptations to repetitive game actions. In the current game, lateral players perform multiple duels. These actions are primarily reactive with numerous changes of direction. Lateral players require more use of the hamstrings than do axial players, especially in the eccentric mode. This may explain the adaption of the ratio.

AB  - The presence of zircons of crustal origin in the dunites of Kytlym, a subduction-related concentrically zoned dunite-clinopyroxenite-gabbro massif of the Urals Platinum-Bearing Belt, may provide the first direct evidence of the recycling of continental crust into the mantle. Zircons were part of subducted sediments that melted to produce silicic magmas with entrained restitic zircons, These melts induced partial melting in the overlying mantle, which later crystallized as the Kytlym massif. Zircons rapidly captured into early formed dunites were prevented from dissolving completely and underwent different degrees of recrystallization. A few crystals still record their original ages, which range from similar to410 Myr to similar to2800 Myr, thus revealing a different, origin. The majority, however, recrystallized in the presence of a limited amount of melt and record the diapir formation, 350-370 Ma, which was coeval with the Uralian high-pressure metamorphism. Lastly, several grains record an age of similar to330 Myr, which is identical, within error, to the Rb-Sr age of the tilaitic gabbros, (337 +/- 22 Myr), and may, therefore, represent the crystallization age of the last melts formed during the evolution: of Kytlym.

AB  - We use multichannel seismic reflection profiles to determine the seismic stratigraphy of the flexural moat that flanks the Canary Islands. The moat stratigraphy has been divided into 5 units on the basis of internal character and correlation of distinctive reflections. The deepest units, I and II, which well-ties indicate are Eocene and older, thicken towards the east suggesting they are the consequence of sediment loading at the Moroccan continental margin. Units III, IV and V, which are Oligocene and younger and highly reflective, thicken concentrically around individual islands suggesting they are dominantly the result of volcanic loading. Distinct stratigraphic patterns of onlap at the base and offlap at the top of individual flexural units are seen on the across-moat profiles but they were not easily identified on our limited along-moat profiles. The thickness of the upper three units is in accord with the predictions of flexural loading models. Moreover, a model in which the volcanoes that make up the Canary Islands progressively load the underlying lithosphere from east to west generally accounts for the thickness variations that are observed in the region of individual islands. We date the shield building stages of the Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and La Gomera as Oligocene to Early Miocene, that of Tenerife as Middle Miocene to Late Miocene and those of La Palma and El Hierro as Pliocene to Quaternary. The best overall fit to stratigraphic data in the northern moat is for an elastic thickness of the lithosphere, T-e, of 35 km, which is similar to the 30-40 km which would be expected for Oligocene and Neogene loading of Jurassic oceanic lithosphere. There is evidence that a contribution from the margin is required to explain the divergence of Units III, IV and V along the Moroccan margin. Detailed modelling of an along-strike seismic profile of the moat north of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, however, suggests that flexure due to island loading fully explains the stratigraphic patterns that are observed and does not require an additional contribution from the margin. The most likely explanation for this observation is that a 'barrier' had developed by the Oligocene, along the present trend of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, which prevented sediments from the Moroccan margin infilling the northern parts of the moats caused by volcanic loading. Furthermore, there is evidence from differences in the thickness of Units I and II that a barrier may also have existed prior to the Oligocene which protected the northern basin from corrosive bottom currents that removed large amounts of late Cretaceous and Palaeogene age material from the southern basin.

AB  - Background: Early or late pouch dilatations account for a moderate complication rate after restrictive bariatric operations. Various strategies were developed to prevent or treat pouch dilatations.
   Methods: A case of necrosis of gastric wall in a concentric dilated pouch following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is reported as a severe complication of a conservative treatment attempt.
   Results: Emergency laparotomy resulted in band removal, partial gastric resection and prolonged hospital stay.
   Conclusion: Conservative strategies in the treatment of pouch dilatations bear the risk of complications, with both failure of the bariatric procedure and critical clinical course. Indication for early operative reintervention is recommended.

AB  - In eccentric exercise the contracting muscle is forcibly lengthened; in concentric exercise it shortens. While concentric contractions initiate movements, eccentric contractions slow or stop them. A unique feature of eccentric exercise is that untrained subjects become stiff and sore the clay afterwards because of damage to muscle fibres. This review considers two possible initial events as responsible for the subsequent damage, damage to the excitation-contraction coupling system and disruption at, the level of the sarcomeres. Other changes seen after eccentric exercise, a fall in active tension, shift in optimum length for active tension, and rise in passive tension, are seen, on balance, to favour sarcomere disruption as the starting, point for the damage, As well as damage to muscle fibres there is evidence of disturbance of muscle sense organs and of proprioception. A second period of exercise, a week after the first, produces much less damage. This is the result of an adaptation process. One proposed mechanism for the adaptation is an increase in sarcomere number in muscle fibres. This leads to a secondary shift in the muscle's optimum length for active tension. The ability of muscle to rapidly adapt following the damage from eccentric exercise raises the possibility of clinical applications of mild eccentric exercise, such as for protecting a muscle against more major injuries.

AB  - Flight characteristics and dispersal patterns of male fall webworms, Ilyphantria cunea (Drury), were investigated in three experiments: it flight-mill experiment to estimate potential flight metrics, a wind-tunnel experiment for daily, patterns of stale activity, and field trials of mark-recapture for estimating dispersal patterns of males in the field. In the flight-mill experiment, males had the potential to fly over 7 kin after 12 h on average and, at maximum, longer than 23 km. However, the wind-tunnel experiment revealed that at sharp peak of male response was limited to 1 h around the light-on time both in response to it synthetic sex pheromone lure and to virgin females. Thus, the actual flight period of males is limited in the field. In the mark-recapture experiment, the mean distance between recapture points and the release point on the first clay wits < 200 in in both summer and autumn. The largest number of males was captured in the first concentric on the first and the second day despite a few males that were captured outside the first concentric. Male density seemed to be diluted uniformly and distributed outside the first concentric after the fourth day. Thus, fl. cunea males did not disperse over long distances, rattier the dispersal range is likely to be limited to only several hundred meters (< 300 m) achy because of a limited period (30 min-1 h/day) of male mating activity, in nature.

AB  - Bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus) are patchily distributed on two dominant spatial scales: (1) geographically restricted to highly saline marine lagoons, and (2) locally abundant within such lagoons only in relatively discrete beds of seagrass habitat. In the Cape Lookout lagoonal system of North Carolina, adult bay scallop abundance in the most densely occupied, seagrass bed (Oscar Shoal) exhibits repeatable declines from up to 70 m(-2) to near zero in a 2- to 4-week period, during late summer. This crash is completed before fall spawning can be initiated, thereby creating a population sink in what is the singly most productive patch of habitat. Field experiments conducted in the summers of 1996 and 1998 demonstrated that the seasonal extinction of bay scallops on Oscar Shoal can be prevented by the erection Of 1-m(2) stockades, made of 50-cm-high vertical poles, spaced every 25 cm, which inhibit access by cownose rays. Because these stockades were porous to emigration and physical transport, and open to access by all other predators of adult scallops, predation by migrating cownose rays is the only viable explanation for the crash. Consequently, the natural predation process in this system achieves the reproductive extinction of prey in the habitat patch of highest productivity. Over 7 years of observation, the mortality rate in this patch increased with summer density, reaching the asymptote of 100% at 10 m(-2). The site-specific habitat selection by schools of rays may be based on prey density, which could render this example representative of a widespread generator of population sinks in habitat patches of high quality. The virtual extinction of scallops within Oscar Shoal despite nearby patches with relatively high density may be related to the highly efficient feeding behavior of schools and the high vulnerability of bay scallops in a context of multiple alternative prey types.

AB  - Methods for measuring the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, density and viscosity of molten slags and fluxes have been critically reviewed.
   The most common method for determining the viscosity of slags is the concentric cylinder method and in particular the rotating bob variant. There is now a well established reference material suitable for high temperatures and two standards for the most common materials investigated i.e. glass and mould powders. For low viscosities (of the order of 5mPa.s) the oscillating vessel method is suitable. The oscillating plate method has been investigated extensively for the measurement of mould fluxes by Japanese workers. A major problem is the containment of the slags to prevent unwanted reactions and the choice of materials used by a selection of workers is reviewed.
   Fewer density than viscosity measurements have been made. The most popular methods of determining densities are the maximum bubble pressure (also suitable for determining surface tension); Archimedean and sessile drop methods. There is no corresponding infra structure for density measurements of slags as for their viscosities.
   For the thermal diffusivity/conductivity, the most common methods are the laser flash and the transient hot wire techniques. The treatment of the experimental results is complicated, such as including the effects of radiation for translucent materials. It is clear, if the information is industrially important, there are substantial opportunities for further method development including standardisation and understanding the physical processes of heat transfer in these materials.

AB  - Recreational camping in wilderness areas causes a number of biophysical impacts, including loss of woody debris through campfires. Although extensive research has documented trampling impacts to vegetation, few studies have explored the extent of woody material depletion. This study adapted planar transect methods to measure the relative loss of fine (<0.6 cm), small (0.6 to 2.5 cm), medium (2.6 to 7.6 cm) and large (>7.6 cm) diameter materials in three concentric rings extending 0-5 m, 5-10 m and 10-15 m from the centre of 58 campsites in different environments ranging in elevation from 1250 to 2225 m in the Cascades Mountains in Oregon, USA. Compared to matched controls, losses were greatest for small (40%) and medium-sized (63%) materials, but were evident for fine (25%) and large (30%) materials as well. Surprisingly, depletion (across all sizes) was no greater in the centre of sites than in the outer measurement ring, even though the outer ring was often in intact vegetation. This suggests that impacts on woody debris extend beyond those impacts to vegetation typically monitored at campsites. Such recreational impacts to woody debris have rarely been systematically described. However, research on woody debris removal related to forest management indicates possible ecological effects of fuelwood consumption.

AB  - All butterfly eyespots appear to be formed by a similar developmental mechanism. Thus the great diversity of patterns observed across different species of butterfly has evolved through changes in the genetic modulation of this mechanism. Our descriptions of both the development of eyespots and the genetic variation for eyespot traits in an African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, are used here to discuss the most appropriate ways of applying the character concept to the evolution of butterfly eyespot patterns.

AB  - Background. Blocking the action of interleukin (IL) 17 with an IL-17 receptor (R):Fc fusion protein inhibits T-cell proliferative responses to alloantigens and prolongs vascularized heart graft survival. In this study, we examined whether IL-17 antagonism could suppress the development of chronic rejection.
   Methods. A 0.6-cm section of C57BL10 (H2(b)) thoracic aorta was transplanted to recipient C3H (H2(k)) abdominal aorta. IL-17R:Fc or control human immunoglobulin G was administered i.p. (500 mug/day) from days 0 to 6 or from days 0 to 29. Mice were killed on days 7 or 30. Grafts were examined histologically and stained for a-smooth muscle actin (alpha -smA). Antidonor mixed leukocyte reaction, cytotoxic T cell, and alloantibody responses were quantified.
   Results. On day 7, control grafts showed mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration, pronounced endothelial damage, and apoptosis of intimal and medial cell compartments. By day 30, there was concentric intimal thickening, accumulation of alpha -smA(+) cells, and collagen deposition. Patchy destruction of the elastic membranes and loss of a-smA expression in media were evident. IL-17R:Fc for 6 days decreased MNC infiltration in the intimal. and medial compartments at day 7. The endothelium, was preserved (completely or partially) in all grafts. The medial compartment showed normal a-smA expression. Irrespective of IL-17R:Fc treatment for either 6 days or continuously, allografts harvested at day 30 showed circumferential intimal thickening, with accumulation of alpha -smA(+) cells and collagen deposition. There was no effect on circulating alloantibody levels.
   Conclusions. These findings support a role for IL-17 in the immunopathogenesis of acute vascular rejection and demonstrate the potential of IL-17 antagonism for therapy. By contrast, IL-17 antagonism does not appear to prevent ensuing chronic graft vascular disease, in particular neointimal formation.

AB  - Artemisia annua, well recognized for its production of antimalarial drug artemisinin, is seldom attacked by any of phytopathogenic fungi, which could be partially associated with the presence of endophytes. Present investigation is aiming at disclosing whether the endophytes inside A. annua produce antifungal substances. A total of 39 endophytes were isolated and fermented, and the ferment broth was evaluated in vitro for the antifungal activity against crop-threatening fungi Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Rhizoctonia cerealis, Helminthosporium sativum, Fusarium graminearum, Gerlachia nicalis and Phytophthora capsici. These plant pathogens are still causing wheat take-all, sharp eyespot, common rot, scab, snow mould, and pepper phytophthora blight, respectively. Out of 39 endophytes investigated, 21 can produce in vitro substances that are inhibitory to all or a few of the tested phytopathogens whereas the rest yielded nothing active. Moreover, the most active broth of endophyte IV403 was extracted with EtOAc and n-butanol, and comparisons of the antifungal activity of the extracts indicated that the major active metabolites were EtOAc-extractable.

AB  - ERS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) frames were collected over the northern Gulf of California during winter 1999. The frames, presented here as a single composite image (100 x 300 km), express a mesoscale meander or eddy-like feature, approximately 80 km wide, located close to the peninsula of Baja California. The eddy is expressed as bright, concentric bands that curve in an anticyclonic direction. The location and dimensions of the eddy are in very good agreement with the winter circulation of the northern Gulf of California described by Lavin et al. (1997), from the analysis of direct observations using satellite-tracked drifters and hydrographic surveys. The SAR image also depicts other smaller, cyclonic eddy-like features, located close to the mainland, which may be associated with the general circulation induced by the anticyclonic eddy. SAR images, together with the reduced number of in situ observations, can provide new and valuable information about the mesoscale circulation of the upper ocean in the Gulf of California, even when cloud cover prevents the use of other remote sensors, such as infrared radiometers and visible imaging systems.

AB  - Three experiments on winter wheat, each lasting 5 years and on different soil types, were used to test the effects of incorporating different amounts of straw, mainly to determine the importance of achieving uniform distribution to avoid adverse effects on grain yield. Decreases in crop growth and/or grain yield as a consequence of incorporating straw were detected in the first year. The decreases were much larger in one experiment where straw was imported and applied to soil that had been fallowed for 12 months before sowing the wheat than in the other two where the straw was incorporated following the harvest of a winter wheat crop. Tn the subsequent 4 years, incorporating up to 20 t straw/ha had no significant effects on grain yield but there were some significant effects on concentrations and uptakes of N, P and K, especially on the heavier textured soils. The effects on crop growth and yield that were detected in the first year on each site are tentatively attributed to decreases in available N representing that which was required to support the decomposition of the incorporated straw. The relative lack of significant effects in subsequent years seems to imply that a significant proportion of this N was remineralized relatively quickly. and thus available to support the decomposition of the straw that was incorporated in the second year and. after further recycling, in the years after that. Eyespot, caused by the fungus Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, was decreased by incorporating straw but there were few; significant effects on other diseases. The results provide a generally reassuring message for farmers in suggesting that on most, if not all, soils there is little cause for concern about the consequences of incorporating even large amounts of wheat straw before sowing a further crop of winter wheat.

AB  - The lobula giant motion detector (LGMD) is a wide-field bilateral visual interneuron in North American locusts that acts as an angular threshold detector during the approach of a solid square along a trajectory perpendicular to the long axis of the animal (Gabbiani et al., 1999a). We investigated the dependence of this angular threshold computation on several stimulus parameters that alter the spatial and temporal activation patterns of inputs onto the dendritic tree of the LGMD, across three locust species. The same angular threshold computation was implemented by LGMD in all three species. The angular threshold computation was invariant to changes in target shape (from solid squares to solid discs) and to changes in target texture (checkerboard and concentric patterns). Finally, the angular threshold computation did not depend on object approach angle, over at least 135 degrees in the horizontal plane. A two-dimensional model of the responses of the LGMD based on linear summation of motion-related excitatory and size-dependent inhibitory inputs successfully reproduced the experimental results for squares and discs approaching perpendicular to the long axis of the animal. Linear summation, however, was unable to account for invariance to object texture or approach angle. These results indicate that LGMD is a reliable neuron with which to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying the generation of complex but invariant visual responses by dendritic integration. They also suggest that invariance arises in part from non-linear integration of excitatory inputs within the dendritic tree of the LGMD.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
LA  - English
KW  - EXCRETION
AB  - An accurate and simple method has been developed for the determination of uranium in urine using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Isotope dilution analysis was applied using the long-lived uranium nuclide U-233 as a spike in 1.3-fold diluted urine samples. To avoid matrix effects and salt depositions in the interface region of the instrument a prototype concentric-flow nebulizer with a mini cyclonic spray chamber was used at a reduced sample uptake rate of 0.3 ml min(-1). The method was evaluated by comparison with alpha -spectrometry, as well as by analysis of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2670, Toxic Metals in Freeze Dried Urine, for which published results of isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) measurements are available. ICP-MS and alpha -spectrometry yielded consistent results (Wilcoxon, p = 0.87). The ICP-MS mean value (+/-95% confidence interval) of 143 +/- 10 pg ml(-1) obtained for the SRM 2670 agreed with the reported RNAA value of 130 +/- 18 pg ml(-1) at the 95% confidence interval; however, they exceeded the reported TIMS value of 113 +/- 3 pg ml(-1). The proposed method provides a means for determining uranium in unexposed subjects as well as in those considered to be exposed. Potential exposure to uranium amongst employees of UNHCR in western Kosovo was assessed.

The species is characterized by a conspicuous habit. of dark concentric spots on the silver-coloured bark of the host plant. A. aloes has features close to members of the genera Arthopyrenia A. Massal. and Didymella Sacc. Its generic placement is discussed and similarities to Stigmidium Trevis. are pointed out. A. aloes is regarded as a member of the genus Arthropyrenia, mainly because of its ascus and ascospore features and the presence of both periphyses and cellular pseudoparaphyses.

KW  - TESTS
AB  - For the purpose of assessing the strength of engineering ceramics, it is common practice to interpret the measured stresses at fracture in the light of a semi-empirical expression derived from Weibull's theory of brittle fracture, i.e., ln [- ln(1 - P)] = -m ln(sigma(N)) + m ln(sigma), where P is the cumulative failure probability, a is the applied tensile stress, m is the Weibull modulus, and sigma(N) is the nominal strength. The strength sigma(N), however, does not represent a "true" mea, sure because it depends not only on the test method but also on the size of the volume or the surface subjected to tensile stresses. In this paper we intend to first clarify issues relating to the application of Weibull's theory of fracture and then make use of the theory to assess the results of equibiaxial flexure testing that was carried out on polycrystalline infrared-transmitting materials. These materials are brittle ceramics, which most frequently fail as a consequence of tensile stresses acting on surface flaws. Since equibiaxial flexure testing is the preferred method of measuring the strength of optical ceramics, we propose to formulate the failure-probability equation in terms of a characteritic strength, sigma(C), for biaxial loadings, i.e., P = 1 - exp {- pi (r(o) /cm)(2) [Gamma (1 + 1/m)](m) (sigma/sigma(C))(m)}, where r(o) is the radius of the loading ring (in centimeter) and Gamma(z) designates the gamma function. A Weibull statistical analysis of equibiaxial. strength data thus amounts to obtaining the parameters m and sigma(C), which is best done by directly fitting estimated P-i vs i data to the failure-probability equation; this procedure avoids distorting the distribution through logarithmic linearization and can be implemented by performing a non-linear bivariate regression. Concentric-ring fracture testing performed on five sets of Raytran(TM) materials validates the procedure in the sense that the two-parameter model appears to describe the experimental failure-probability distributions remarkably well. Specifically, we demonstrate that the wide divergence in published CVD-diamond strength data reflects the poor Weibull modulus of this material and must be attributed to the size effect rather than the "quality" of the deposits. Finally, the problem of obtaining correct failure stresses from the measured failure loads is examined in the Appendix.

TI  - The "Fool's Speech" and its context: Paul's particular way of arguing in 2-Corinthians-X-XIII (An attempt to formulate theological insights and conclusions within Pauline epistolary structuring)
T2  - BIBLICA
LA  - English
AB  - Paul's particular way of arguing in 2 Corinthians 10-13 is visible in the Fool's Speech (11,22-12,10) as well as in its context. The speech is interrupted more than once and there are shifts regarding the object of boasting. The introduction to the speech (11,1-21) is not straightforward and two brief retrospections (12,11a and 19a) should not go unnoticed. The major topic in this study, however, consists in the indication of three rings within the context of the Fool's Speech: (1) 10,1 and 13,11 (moral exhortation); (2) 10,2-18 and 13,1-10 (Paul's defense of his authority); (3) 11,5-12 and 12,11b-18 (Paul denies inferiority). Yet from the presence of these enveloping rings a strict concentric structure of 2 Corinthians 11-13 cannot be deduced. Special attention must also be given to 10,8.12-18 and 11,3-4.12-15.18-20. In these passages Paul, by comparing and attacking, seems to prepare his boasting as a fool in a more direct way.

AB  - Interspecific hybridization in Protea has long been plagued by very low seed set. Success of interspecific seed set following controlled hand-pollination is very variable. Investigations revealed that placing of the pollinated florets on the involucral receptacle plays a role in the success of hybridization. Florets grouped into clusters on the involucral receptacle, rather than in a concentric ring improved seed set rates across a spectrum of controlled hand-pollination combinations. Use of taxonomic relatedness for planning cross combinations improved seed set further. Differences in the time frame of stigmatic groove opening were observed between and within species and hybrids. It is probable that further improvement of seed set can be obtained by determining optimal timing of the opening of the stigmatic groove, rather than using a common time frame for all crosses.

TI  - A robust Bayesian multisensor fusion algorithm for joint lane and pavement boundary detection
T2  - 2001 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL I, PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
CP  - International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2001)
AB  - In this paper we propose to simultaneously detect lane and pavement boundaries by fusing information from both optical and radar images. The boundaries are described with concentric circular models, whose parameters are compatible and will result in better conditioned estimation problems than previous parabolic models. The optical and radar imaging processes are represented with Gaussian and log-normal probability densities, with which we successfully avoid the ad hoc weighting scheme carried on the two likelihood functions. The multisensor fusion boundary detection problem is posed in a Bayesian framework and a joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is employed to locate the lane and pavement boundaries. Experimental results have shown that the fusion algorithm outperforms single sensor based boundary detection algorithms in a variety of road scenarios. And it also yields better boundary detection results than the fusion algorithm that took advantage of existing prior and likelihood formulations.

AB  - In this paper we describe a test for Nijhout's (1978. 1980a) hypothesis that the eyespot patterns on butterfly wings are the result of a threshold reaction of the epidermal cells to a concentration gradient of a diffusing degradable morphogen produced by focal cells at the centre of the future eyespot. The wings of the nymphalid butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, have a series of eyespots, each composed of a white pupil, a black disc and a gold outer ring. In earlier extirpation and transplantation experiments (Nijhout 1980a; French and Brakefield, 1995) it has been established that these eyespots are indeed organised around groups of signalling cells active during the first hours of pupal development. If these cells were to supply the positional information for eyespot formation in accordance with Nijhout's diffusion-degradation gradient model, then, when two foci are close together, the signals should sum, and this effect should be apparent in the detailed shape of the resulting pigment pattern. We give an equation for the form of the contours that would be obtained in this manner. We use this to test the morphogen gradient hypothesis on measurements of the outlines of fused eyespots obtained either by grafting focal cells close together, or by using a mutation (Spotty) that produces adjacent fused eyespots. The contours of the fused patterns were found to satisfy our equation, thus corroborating Nijhout's hypothesis to the extent possible with this particular type of experiment.

AB  - Butterfly wings are colored late in development, when pigments are synthesized in specialized wing scale cells in a fixed developmental succession. In this succession, colored pigments are deposited first and the remaining areas are later melanized black or brown. Here we studied the developmental changes underlying two wing pattern mutants, firstly melanic mutants of the swallowtail Papilio glaucus, in which the yellow background is turned black, and secondly a Spotty mutant of the satyrid Bicyclus anynana, which carries two additional eyespots. Despite the Very different pattern changes in these two mutants, they are both associated with changes in rates of scale development and correspondingly, the final color pattern. In the melanic swallowtail, background scales originally destined to become yellow (normally developing early and synthesizing papiliochrome) show delayed development, fail to make papiliochrome, and subsequently melanize at the same time as scales in the wild-type black pattern. In the B. anynana eyespot. scale maturation begins with the central white focus, then progresses to the surrounding gold ring and later finishes with melanization of the black center. Mutants showing additional eyespots display accelerated rates of scale development (corresponding to new eyespots) in wing cells not normally occupied by eyespots. Thus by either delaying or accelerating rates of scale development, the final color, or position, of a wing pattern element can be changed. We propose that this heterochrony of scale development is a basic mechanism of color pattern formation on which developmental mutants act to change lepidopteran color patterns.

TI  - Pressure building during the early stages of gas production in a radioactive waste repository
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
LA  - English
KW  - POROUS-MEDIA
AB  - In a radioactive waste repository, hydrogen may be produced by anoxic corrosion of the metallic components, and by water radiolysis. The design of deep geological repositories presently envisaged in many countries tends to inhibit the migration of every chemical species coming from the repository, by means of several concentric watertight barriers. This tightness, which is desirable for other reasons, might prevent hydrogen evacuation and cause a pressure rise in the near-field. Can this pressure break the barriers? In the first stage of the process, the hydrogen dissolves in the porewater. It is shown in the present paper that in the vicinity of a steel surface embedded in clay, the pressure rise due to the production of dissolved hydrogen may be large already (a few MPa), and may represent a significant fraction of the barrier resistance limit. In the second phase of the process, a gas bubble may form, causing a further pressure increase. The problem of gas production in geological repositories is treated here as a special case of thermo-hydro-chemico-mechanical coupling in a porous medium. The time needed for the bubble to form depends on the nature of the metal, and on the characteristics of the barrier. The purpose of this paper is to give orders of magnitude for the time and space scales associated with hydrogen production in the near-field of a deep repository, before the formation of a gaseous phase. The conditions under which a gas phase forms are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Graft vascular disease (GVD) is an incompletely understood process and the primary cause of late allograft failure. A nonhuman primate model was established to study the progression of GVD by using serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
   Methods. Aortic allografts were transplanted below the inferior mesenteric arteries (IMA) into 6 rhesus monkeys. Removed and re-implanted aortic segments between renal arteries, and the inferior mesenteric arteries served as autografts. IVUS was performed at days 0, 24, 52, 80, and 98 after transplantation. Vessel area (VA) and lumen area (LA) were measured from each cross-section at 0.5 mm intervals. Intimal index (II=100x (VA-LA/VA)) and corresponding vessel volumes were calculated for the whole grafts. Histologic features were assessed from autopsy samples using computerized morphometric method and a score from 6 to 3 for GVD (0=none, 3=severe).
   Results. In allografts, vessel volume and luminal volume decreased significantly (P<0.05 for both) and the intimal index increased from 12% to 59% by day 98, These parameters remained unchanged in autografts, Histologic analysis of allografts showed concentric intimal hyperplasia and scattered mononuclear cell accumulations, whereas the autografts had only occasional eccentric intimal changes. The GVD-scores were significantly higher in allografts than in autografts (median 3 vs. 1, P=0.042).
   Conclusions. We introduce a nonhuman primate model of GVD that enables serial IVUS assessments of multiple parameters of GVD. Concentric intimal proliferation and decrease of vessel dimensions was observed in allografts as a consequence of alloimmunity. This is a potential new model for studying new therapies to prevent GVD or halt its progression.

AB  - Anatomical and biomechanical features and the subject's training background make hamstring strains common in sport, especially in disciplines requiring speed and strength. Rehabilitation must be consonant with the chronological sequence of the acute and healing stages of biological muscle strain repair and recovery of function. Hydrokinesitherapy, stretching, concentric and eccentric exercise, physical therapy, isokinetic dynamometry and proprioceptive training are useful components of a rehabilitation programme. Prevention of recurrences, not speed of recovery, is the goal. Recurrence within two months from the resumption of sport, in fact, is often an indication of inappropriate rehabilitation.

AB  - This paper investigates first the performance of a rotating disk microfiltration system, described by the mean permeate flux as a function of particle concentration, disk rotation speed and peripheral transmembrane pressure (TMP), using suspensions of calcium carbonate particles. The second part presents the radial distribution of permeate flux and filtration resistance obtained by using concentric membrane rings and their relationship with local shear stress and TMP. Our data confirm that high shear stresses induced by the disk rotation prevent the formation of a cake on the membrane except in the central part at low speed. Consequently, this system is capable of maintaining high permeate fluxes (200 l h(-1) m(-2)) at large particle concentrations (700 kg m(-3)). At speeds above 1100 rpm, the permeate flux increases with radius above 4 cm and fouling disappears almost completely in the peripheral zone. The local flux in the central zone reaches a plateau when TMP is increased above 35 kPa, while it keeps increasing with pressure in other zones. The filtration resistance was found to increase linearly with local TMP in all zones, but at a lesser rate in peripheral ones. Fouling irreversibility was observed when reducing rotation speed, especially at high TMP. We conclude that this system is very efficient in case of external fouling when used at disk tip velocities above 12 m s(-1). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cost of astrographs with pupil diameters greater than 1 or 2 meters can be somewhat reduced if the primary mirror is made spherical and the aberration corrected at or near the prime focus, thus avoiding the classical Schmidt or Maksutov full pupil diameter refractive components.
   Such a corrector solution is presented here for large spherical primaries with speeds up to f/4. This is based on the "KiwiStar" principle presented here in 1997, in which a large spherical-concentric catoptric is combined by pupil transfer with a smaller spherical-concentric catadioptric to give well-corrected wide-field images of high speed and broad passband. The designs studied at the time were limited to those with entrance pupils <2m diameter, but it has been found possible to extend the aberration correction capability to pupils of larger diameter. The only significant constraint found in the present study is that the spherical aberration of primaries faster than E/4 is difficult to control.
   The design presented here is a 4m entrance-pupil-diameter, f/1.4 optic of 0.2 arcsec rms resolution over the whole of a 0.5<degrees> field (50mm diameter), for a bandpass of 486-850nm. To fully sample this field would require 108 pixels of 5 mum dimension. An extended design with an sm diameter primary is also shown, that may be scalable to similar to 30m.
   To achieve this performance, the strictly concentric format of the original "KiwiStar" design has been relaxed, thus providing extra degrees of freedom to compensate the large pupil aberrations introduced by the spherical aberration of the primary. Nevertheless, the new design still has only one relatively small and weak aspheric surface to provide zonal correction, all other surfaces being spherical.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the isokinetic profile of specialized athletes with previous hamstring tears and recurrent complaints upon return to sports activities, using a Kintrex 500 dynamometer. Twenty-three subjects were examined through a concentric protocol and fifteen of them benefited from a complementary eccentric assessment. Despite the fact that some cases presented normal isokinetic results, the statistical analysis has demonstrated particular features. In reference to the non-involved side performances, the average reduction of peak torque (PT) of the injured muscles surpassed 20% in eccentric contraction. The relationship between bodyweight normalized PT and angular velocity demonstrated significant differences in comparison with those of selected non-injured sprinters, most notably in the eccentric sector. A mixed ratio (Flexors(eccentric)/Quadriceps(concentric)) appeared significantly reduced (0.75 +/- 0.23) for the injured leg, in comparison with the contralateral non-injured limb (0.90 +/- 0.16) and with a control population (0.98 +/- 0.14). For the eccentric mode, the angle of peak torque (APT) of the strained muscle occurred in an abnormal articular sector corresponding to a weaker hamstring muscle lengthening than normal. These observations strongly suggest that, among the causative factors, the persistence of muscle strength abnormalities gives rise to recurring hamstring injuries.

CP  - IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2000)
AB  - While several image-based rendering techniques have been proposed to successfully render scenes/objects from a large collection (e.g., thousands) of images without explicitly recovering 3D structures, the minimum number of images needed to achieve a satisfactory rendering result remains an open problem. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the lower bound for the number of samples needed in the Lumigraph[4]/light held rendering[5].
   To simplify the analysis, we consider an ideal scene with only a point that is between a minimum and a maximum range. Furthermore, constant-depth assumption and bilinear interpolation are used for rendering. The constant-depth assumption serves to choose "nearby" rays for interpolation. Our criterion to determine the lower bound is to avoid horizontal and vertical double images, which are caused by interpolation using multiple nearby rays. This criterion is based on the causality requirement in scale-space theory, i.e., no "spurious details" should be generated while smoothing. Using this criterion, closed-form solutions of lower bounds are obtained for both 3D plenoptic function (Concentric Mosaics[8]) and 4D plenoptic function (light field). The bounds are derived completely from the aspect of geometry and are closely related to the resolution of the camera and the depth range of the scene. These lower bounds are further verified by our experimental results.

KW  - BEHAVIOR
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - This paper describes an analytical study performed to evaluate the influence of the brace slenderness ratio on the seismic performance of concentrically braced steel frames. Nonlinear time history dynamic analyses have been performed on typical building structures. The brace slenderness, lambda, for the braces was varied from 0.35 to 2.65 for tension-compression brace design and from 0.85 to infinite for tension-only brace design. The building height was varied from 1 to 8 storeys. The results of the analyses indicate that the inelastic demand in the tension-compression bracing systems decreases as the brace slenderness is increased. For tension-only bracing, the inelastic demand generally increases when increasing the brace slenderness. For both bracing systems, it was also found that higher inelastic demand was generally associated with a concentration of inelastic damage over the height of the structures. The results suggest that a brace slenderness limit of lambda = 2.65 is appropriate for tension-compression bracing systems. Tension-only design should be allowed, provided that the brace slenderness is kept below the same limit. For both systems, building height limitations are proposed to prevent the formation of a soft-storey mechanism.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the major long-term problem after heart transplantation. However, the assumption, mostly based on experimental animal data, that human CAV is an immune-mediated diffuse concentric intimal proliferation with progressive, homogenous vessel narrowing, involving equally epicardial arteries and the microcirculation, leading inevitably to ischemic organ failure and death, does not adequately reflect the complexity of the clinical setting. CAV in humans is much more characterized by a very heterogeneous pattern concerning pathogenetic mechanisms (e.g., immune activation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, CMV infection, hyperlipoproteinemia), protective mechanisms (e.g., remodeling, endothelium-derived vasodilators), endothelial dysfunction, morphological manifestations, involvement of the microcirculation, temporal appearance, disease progression and prognosis. Thus, clinicians have to deal with several clinical dilemmas of the disease, which can be summarized in three simple questions: how can CAV be detected/diagnosed, how can CAV and related events be predicted, and finally how can CAV be prevented and treated. initial and promising answers to these pivotal questions have been found in recent years, and continuing progress is under way.

AB  - Through a spatial, multi-scale approach I compared available habitat with habitat used by whooping cranes (Grus americana) on their nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. Thirty-two study sites (16 used, 16 available) were established in the nesting area in August 1996. Data were gathered by (a) plots of 9.8 m radius which provided detailed site data and served as ground truth for (b) concentric circular plots of 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 m radius in which 21 cover types were mapped onto false color infrared 1:15,840 airphotos. Whooping cranes chose habitat that differed from a random sample. Habitat selection was strongest at the nest site, when many attributes of habitat type and structure were evident. Beyond 200 m radius from the nest site, selection was evident solely as avoidance of unsuitable habitat. At the nest site scale (9.8 m radius), the preferred habitat was visually open, with large amounts of open water (median depth 7 cm in August), nearby which there were a few abundant vegetation species in an open spatial arrangement. Habitat types used by whooping cranes were diatom ponds, bulrush (Scirpus validus) marshes, bulrush/ cattail (Typha latifolia) mixed marshes with aquatic macrophytes, and shrubby mixed marshes with water sedge (Carex aquatilis) and cattail. Plant species diversity of the entire crane area is low, particularly that of nesting sites. In contrast, spatial diversity of community types is a marked characteristic of the area; average patch size is < 1 ha. At the 78.5 ha scale (500 m radius), there were no apparent differences in landscape structure or diversity between used vs available habitats. MANOVA/repeated measures and multi-response permutation procedures were used to examine habitat selection at five spatial scales. Whooping cranes selected bulrush marsh out to a radius of 200 m from the nest, and avoided featureless shrub bogs and fens out to a radius of at least 500 m from nests. Historical and present nesting habitat share the following characteristics: small shallow lakes and ponds, willow com munities, marshes of bulrush and cattail, mudflats, and perhaps sedge meadows. The present nesting habitat may be atypical compared to the core of the historical range in its diatom ponds, gypsum karst-groundwater discharge hydrogeology, and permafrost. Cranes appear to use only a small portion of the total available area of their nesting grounds. The Wood Buffalo-Aransas whooping crane population should not be limited by available breeding habitat in the near future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study Design: Single group, post-test only descriptive analysis of isokinetically measured shoulder internal and external rotation muscular fatigue.
   Objectives: To determine whether differences in isokinetically measured muscular fatigue exist between shoulder external (ER) and internal rotation (IR) and between the dominant (DOM) and nondominant (NDOM) extremity in elite junior tennis players.
   Background: The importance of the rotator cuff in stabilizing the humeral head during repetitive athletic overhead motions has been identified in biomechanical investigations. The application of exercise to improve muscular function of the shoulder and prevent injury is a common practice in physical therapy, but shoulder fatigue in tennis players has received little attention in the literature.
   Methods and Measures: Seventy-two elite junior tennis players (ages 12 to 18) underwent bilateral isokinetic testing with 90 degrees of glenohumeral joint abduction. A muscular fatigue protocol consisting of 20 maximal-effort concentric contractions of ER and IR was used to measure muscular fatigue at 300 degrees/s. A relative fatigue ratio was calculated by dividing the work in the last 10 repetitions by the work in the first 10 repetitions. Higher fatigue ratios indicate improved muscular fatigue resistance. A 2 x 2 ANOVA was used to assess differences in fatigue in DOM versus NDOM arm, and in IR versus ER.
   Results: Relative muscular fatigue ratios for ER and IR were 69.1 +/- 15.3% and 82.93 +/- 14.81% for the DOM extremity, respectively. In the NDOM extremity ER and IR fatigue ratios were 71.13 +/- 15.07% and 83.9 +/- 16.5%, respectively. These results indicate significant differences between the fatigue ratios for ER and IR. No significant difference between extremities in either ER or IR relative fatigue ratios was found.
   Conclusions: These data have implications for rehabilitation and conditioning of the rotator cuff musculature.

AB  - The combined effect of purge/coolant flow rate and nonwhirling, rotor-casing radial eccentricity on the gas-turbine wheelspace cavity thermal environment was determined from a computational study. in this study, a series of Reynolds-averaged, Navier-Stokes numerical experiments was undertaken to obtain an improved understanding of mass ingress cavity heating. A recently developed and heavily tested three-scale k-epsilon turbulence model was utilized. The temperature, pressure, Mach number, and Reynolds number of a typical commercial gas-turbine engine were specified as appropriate for the mainstream, purge/coolant stream, and turbine wheel. At engine nominal conditions, no mass ingress (100% rim seal effectiveness) was found for the concentric rotor case. However, for 50% rotor-casing eccentricity, large mass ingress and only 53% rim seal effectiveness were found, In addition, the minimum purge flow to prevent mass ingress increased markedly, i.e., from 8000 to 23,500 as the rotor eccentricity increased from 5 to 50%.

AB  - Parent-offspring regression was used to estimate heritabilities (h(2)) of eight wing pattern characters plus five principal components of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. The experiment consisted of six metapopulations with four subpopulations each with an effective subpopulation site Ne = 6 or 12, and additionally, one larger (Ne = 24) panmictic control population. Although the differences in treatments resulted in substantially different inbreeding coefficients at the ninth generation, there were no significantly differences in estimates of h(2) among populations. The h(2) estimates were moderately high (overall mean h(2) = 0.43), even for the smallest most inbred metapopulation (mean h(males)(2) = 0.51, mean h(females)(2) = 0.35). We discuss why no significant reduction in h(2) was detected in this analysis, while approximately similar sample sizes in molecular and fitness analyses were sufficient to detect severe inbreeding effects.

A portion of the other three strains entered diapause when reared at 19 or 22 degrees C and 10:14 h photoperiod (L:D). No A. marmoratus entered diapause; 90% eclosed with no differences among strains or rearing condition, and the number of days from host pupation to eclosion within rearing condition was similar regardless of host strain. Parasitized pupae did not enter a chill-terminated diapause, as indicated by loss of larval eyespots within 2 wks. Either the presence of A. marmoratus maggots prevented diapause in its host or diapause was terminated by rapid development of the maggot after host pupation. These data suggest that A. marmoratus does not overwinter as a larva or pupa in the cooler regions of its distribution.

AB  - This paper suggests an efficient approach to collision avoidance of a practical two-robot system. The approach is based on the C-space of one robot, and we consider only two and three dimensional C-space in which nearly all industrial manipulators can be reasonably represented for collision avoidance problems. The C-space of one robot is discretized with the concentric circles or spheres centered at the goal configuration. We then introduce the concept of free arc which is a set of the candidate configuration points on the concentric circle or sphere at each sampling time to avoid collisions. It is represented simply with respect to the coordinate frame attached to the goal configuration. The free are is used as a tool for collision avoidance of a two-robot system and sub-optimality can be considered in determining a collision-free path. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a method to construct C-obstacles in a time-varying environment more efficiently than the existing methods (e.g. slice projection method(1)) by restricting the search space at the expense of sacrificing completeness. Thus, it enables us to implement a practical collision avoidance algorithm for a two-robot system with decreased computational cost. Simulation results for two 2-d.o.f. manipulators and two PUMA robots are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB  - Visual field defects without any organic correlate require critical control to avoid inadequate management of psychogenic defects. Which methods are promising to detect psychogenic visual field defects? Twenty ophthalmologically trained volunteers motivated to pretend a concentric visual field loss were tested by manual perimetry with centripetal and centrifugal movement of the stimulus, by evoking saccadic eye movements towards a stimulus outside the subjectively claimed visual field and by observation of the volunteers' strategy searching a stimulus beyond the subjectively claimed borders. Malingering could be proven in 16 persons. The most favourable procedure is to evoke eye movements towards a peripheral stimulus. These movements yield information about the visual field outside the subjectively stated limits.

AB  - Spiral mandrel dies are commonly used for pipe and blown film extrusion. Despite their attractive properties they have not been used for wire-coating applications, because the feeding of the rather large number of spirals led to designs with unacceptably high pressure losses.
   A design procedure using only a few spiral channels avoids the aforementioned drawbacks and is suitable for wire-coating applications. Backed up by experimental data and a numerical flow analysis, excellent results in terms of concentricity and regularity can be obtained.

Adenosine counteracts sympathetic activity by inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine release and attenuation of the metabolic and contractile responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the adenosinergic effects (uptake blockade) of dipyridamole may retard the progression of pressure overload hypertrophy in the rat.
   Methods and results To verify that the administration of dipyridamole increases myocardial adenosine levels in the rat, epicardial adenosine concentrations were measured from 12 isolated, perfused rat hearts exposed to 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l dipyridamole. Adenosine concentrations were increased with both doses of dipyridamole. Also, 9 weeks of dipyridamole treatment resulted in decreased sensitivity to the adenosine A(1)-receptor agonist, 2-chloro-N-6-cyclopentyl adenosine, suggesting that dipyridamole increases adenosine revels in the intact rat In the second part of the study, rats were divided into either abdominal aortic-banded or sham-operated groups and were treated with either dipyridamole or saline. After 9 weeks of treatment, two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed and the adrenergic responsiveness to 10(-8) mol/l isoproterenol was assessed in vitro, The saline-treated banded group demonstrated concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal diastolic filling, increased wet lung weights and attenuation of adrenergic responsiveness. In contrast, the dipyridamole-treated banded rats exhibited more concentric geometry (higher relative wall thickness with similar left ventricular mass), normal left ventricular filling characteristics and preserved adrenergic responsiveness. Systolic left ventricular chamber and myocardial function, as assessed by stress-endocardial and midwall shortening relationships, were not significantly altered by banding or dipyridamole treatment
   Conclusions Dipyridamole treatment prevented the development of abnormal left ventricular chamber filling, preserved adrenergic responsiveness and appeared to attenuate detrimental chamber remodeling in rats with pressure overload hypertrophy, (C) Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermuller), is becoming an important pest of pome fruits in British Columbia because implementation of noninsecticidal controls for codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., have removed routine sprays that inadvertently controlled it. Knowing the phenology of S. ocellana could improve timing of controls for this pest. Seasonal night activity of male, eyespotted bud moths was monitored using pheromone-baited traps hung in unsprayed apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia from 1993 to 1996. Emergence of adult males and females and oviposition was monitored from 1994 to 1996 to establish relationships between their phenology and accumulated degree-days above 10 degrees C air temperature or number of days after the 1st moth was caught (biofix). Biofix occurred between 1-5 June, except in 1996, when it occurred 2-3 wk later, and night activity continued until late August. Males and females emerged on the same day, 2.0 +/- 1.7 d (mean +/- SD, n = 3 yr) before biofix, and oviposition began 4.3 +/- 1.5 d after biofix. The nonlinear relationship between cumulative trap catch and d or number of degree-days after biofix was modeled with cumulative Weibull functions. A model based on data from Summerland using days after biofix as the predictor variable was more accurate at predicting the interval between biofix and 50% cumulative trap catch for independent data sets from Kelowna and Winfield than a model using degree-days after biofix as the predictor variable. However, the use of degree-days as a predictor variable has wider application to other regions and years. Similar models were used to describe the relationship between days or degree-days after biofix and cumulative emergence of males, emergence of females, and oviposition, respectively. These models will assist in the development of pheromone-based management programs for the eyespotted bud moth, and can be used to formulate control strategies for this pest.

AB  - Eupyrene and apyrene spermatozoa are contained in separate cysts in the testis of the butterfly Atrophaneura alcinous. Spermatozoa of both types from various parts of the male reproductive tract were examined with particular reference to their morphological characteristics. All spermatozoa collected from the vas deferens and the vesicula seminalis were found to be immotile under a dissecting microscope. No spermatozoa of either type were recognized in any part of the ejaculatory duct. Within the testis, eupyrene spermatozoa are present in bundles and each spermatozoon has a slender nucleus with an acrosome and a long flagellum containing mitochondrial derivatives. Two kinds of appendages, lacinate and reticular, are present on the surface of the sperm membrane. They are replaced with an extracellular sheath during passage through the vas deferens. In contrast, apyrene spermatozoa have neither nucleus nor acrosome, whereas a cup-shaped structure was found at the sperm tip instead of the acrosome. Unlike eupyrene spermatozoa, they are surrounded by a concentric sheath outside the sperm membrane in the vas deferens. Individual apyrene spermatozoa and coiled bundles of eupyrene spermatozoa were both found to accumulate in the vesicula seminalis before mating. These morphological changes during passage through the male reproductive tract suggests the occurrence of a kind of maturation and capacitation process reminiscent of mammalian spermatozoa.

AB  - 1. Larvae from eggs of fifteen wild-caught speckled wood females were reared individually under common conditions (LD 18:6 h and 17 degrees C) in the laboratory.
   2. Pupal colour (green or brown) and the following adult morphological variables that are known or assumed to be related to behavioural variation (thermoregulation, flight, crypsis) were studied: size, relative thorax mass, area of yellow patches on the dorsal forewing, size of submarginal eyespots on the dorsal hindwing, colour of the dorsal thorax, dorsal basal wing, and dorsal distal wing.
   3. The results of the breeding experiment indicate significant differences in adult morphological traits among families, sexes, and pupal colour types.
   4. All adult morphological variables (except spot size and thorax colouration) differed significantly among families, suggesting genetic variation underlying the phenotypic variation. Heritabilities for these features were intermediate (0.38) to high (> 1).
   5. Apart from known aspects (e.g. size), novel aspects of the sexual dimorphism were found: females had paler thoraxes than males, which relates to higher abundance of fur on the thorax and hence to thermoregulatory differences.
   6. Green pupae produced larger individuals with a larger relative thorax mass than brown pupae. Green pupae produced adults with a paler basal wing colour in females, but not in males. These relationships are novel and suggest a trade-off between juvenile and adult investment.

AB  - Hydractiniid hydroids display a range of morphological variation from sheet-like forms (i.e. closely spaced polyps with high rates of stolen branching) to runner-like forms (i.e. widely spaced polyps with low rates of stolen branching), thus exemplifying the patterns of heterochrony found in many colonial animals, ii sheet-like and a runner-like inbred line of Podocoryne carnea were produced to investigate this heterochronic variation further. Selection on colony morphology at the time of the initiation of medusa production resulted in dramatic differences by the F-5 and F-6 generations. Compared with colonies of the sheet-like inbred line, runner-like colonies exhibited smaller sizes at the initiation of medusa production, more irregular colony shapes and diminished stolen development relative to polyp development. In addition to these differences in colony morphology, runner-like colonies also exhibited larger medusae and a greater amount of gastrovascular how to the peripheral stolons. To assess differences in the metabolic capacity underlying this variation in how, the redox state of the polyp epitheliomuscular cells was measured using the fluorescence of NAD(P)H. In response to feeding-induced changes in gastrovascular flow, runner-like colonies show greater redox variation than sheet-like ones, plausibly corresponding to the greater amounts of flow generated by the former colonies relative to the latter. Perturbing the system with dilute solutions of 2,4-dinitrophenol similarly indicates that runner-like colonies contain more functionally oxidizable NAD(P)H. The correlation between gastrovascular flow and morphological differences supports the hypothesis that the former mediates the timing of colony development, perhaps in concert with the observed variation in the redox state of polyp epitheliomuscular cells.

AB  - The sampler extracts uncompressed cores of 13.3 cm in diameter, up to 70 cm long, from the surface layers of peat. It has two close-fitting concentric cylindrical tubes, the outer one acting as a cutter and the inner one as a collector. As the outer tube is introduced by rotation into the peat, the cut core is collected in the inner tube which is maintained in a fixed position during the rotation phase and then pushed down stepwise. This limits friction between the peat core and the wall of the corer and prevents compression or distortion of the peat. These problems are also reduced by means of three skew cutters allowing the peat to be supported during the slicing action. Air can penetrate between the tubes to the lower end of the core, suppressing any suction effect during withdrawal. The sampler has been tested and has worked satisfactorily in many different peat types.

AB  - The fine structure of zoosporogenesis, zoospore germination, and early gametophyte development in Cladophora surera Parodi et Caceres were studied. Zoosporogenesis started with simultaneous meiosis in all nuclei of apical initial cells. The resulting haploid nuclei duplicated in turn by successive centric, closed mitoses. Then, each initial cell divided into two short zoosporangia. Numerous vacuoles appeared around each sporic nucleus. The delimitation of uninucleate zoosporocytes occurred by cytokinetic furrows produced by the coalescence of tiny, clear vesicles, without microtubules. Final shape of the zoospore resulted from gradual expulsion of vacuoles from the cell body. Mature biflagellate zoospores exhibited a conspicuous apical papilla containing fine granular globules, the basal apparatus, and a microtubular "umbrella" formed by numerous cortical microtubules that ran backward the length of the cell body. The chloroplast showed a conspicuous eyespot. The zoosporangial wall disorganized at the pore through which the zoospores were liberated. Zoospores settled on a substrate by their anterior papilla secreting an adhesive. Germination involved retraction of the apical papilla, loss of the "umbrella" microtubules and eyespot, and the lateral absorption of the entire flagellar apparatus, i.e. basal apparatus plus axoneme, into the cytoplasm. Early gametophyte development involved the synthesis of a thin young cell wall, the development of outer peripheral vacuoles, the appearance of the marginal reticulate chloroplast, and the formation of the first central vacuoles derived from abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Close to the plasmalemma ran longitudinally oriented cortical microtubules. Eventually, the germling developed an achlorophylic, elongated rhizoidal portion.

TI  - Air vent in water chamber and surface coating on liner slides concerning auxiliary cooling system for the high temperature engineering test reactor
T2  - NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - Experimental study was made to confirm the validity of new designs of the auxiliary cooling system for the high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR). First, it is necessary to vent residence air in outlet side of water chamber of the auxiliary heat exchanger for the HTTR. Accordingly, we have proposed to mount a proper bend duct in the outlet side of the water chamber. Air vent is done by difference between pressures at both ends of the bend duct caused by the forced water circulation using the water pumps. From flow tests, it was confirmed that it is capable of venting the air through the bend duct by circulating the water in maximum capacity of the water pumps. Second, it is essential to prevent seizure and excessive wear of the liner slides of the auxiliary concentric hot gas duct for the HTTR at a service temperature of 950 degrees C. Therefore, we have put forward to coat titanium nitride (TiN) on the surface of the liner slides made of nickel-based superalloy Hastelloy XR using the thermochemical vapor deposition method. As a result of seizure and wear tests, it was confirmed that the TiN coating film of 3 mu m on the surface of Hastelloy XR is sufficient. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB  - A positioning stand can help a surgeon with positioning and locking endoscopic tools, thereby avoiding the need for an assistant surgeon. The kinematic configuration of the positioning stand is comprised of two main parts: the arm (for positioning), and the wrist (for orienting the tool). The main requirement of the wrist is to perform spherical movements around the incision point. A concentric multilink spherical joint design has been developed for the wrist mechanism. The size synthesis is performed to minimize the overall size of the wrist, and also to maximize its range of angular movements. The type synthesis of the positioning arm has led to the use of a SCARA configuration as a balanced and easily moved arm configuration. The size synthesis of the arm is carried our with the goal of minimizing its overall dimensions, based on the arm's reachable workspace and manipulability. The integration of the wrist and arm is performed by optimizing the orientation of the wrist in such a way that the interference between the wrist and the workspace of the surgeon is minimized.

AB  - There is concern that caribou (Rangifer tarandus) may avoid roads and facilities (i.e., infrastructure) in the Prudhoe Bay oil field (PBOF) in northern Alaska, and that this avoidance can have negative effects on the animals. We quantified the relationship between caribou distribution and PBOF infrastructure during the post-calving period (mid-June to mid-August) with aerial surveys from 1990 to 1995. We conducted four to eight surveys per year with complete coverage of the PBOF. We identified active oil field infrastructure and used a geographic information system (GIS) to construct ten 1 km wide concentric intervals surrounding the infrastructure. We tested whether caribou distribution is related to distance from infrastructure with a chi-squared habitat utilization-availability analysis and log-linear regression. We considered bulls, calves, and total caribou of all sex/age classes separately. The habitat utilization-availability analysis indicated there was no consistent trend of attraction to or avoidance of infrastructure. Caribou frequently were more abundant than expected in the intervals close to infrastructure, and this trend was more pronounced for bulls and for total caribou of all sex/age classes than for calves. Log-linear regression (with Poisson error structure) of numbers of caribou and distance from infrastructure were also done, with and without combining data into the 1 km distance intervals. The analysis without intervals revealed no relationship between caribou distribution and distance from oil field infrastructure, or between caribou distribution and Julian date, year, or distance from the Beaufort Sea coast. The log-linear regression with caribou combined into distance intervals showed the density of bulls and total caribou of all sex/age classes declined with distance from infrastructure. Our results indicate that during the post-calving period: 1) caribou distribution is largely unrelated to distance from infrastructure; 2) caribou regularly use habitats in the PBOF; 3) caribou often occur close to infrastructure; and 4) caribou do not appear to avoid oil field infrastructure.

AB  - Background: In vertebrate embryos, migration of trunk neural crest cells (NCC) proceeds mainly in two streams: a dorsoventral path between the neural tube and somites, and a dorsolateral one between somites and ectoderm. This last pathway is taken by melanocyte precursor cells (MPC) homing the skin, while pigment cells seeding internal organs and the peritoneal wall follow the dorsoventral pathway. Early routes taken by subpopulations of NCC have been well documented using the quail-chick chimaera system and monoclonal antibodies to NCC. However, very little is known about the advanced migratory behavior of MPC, which determines their late distribution patterns at different embryonic axial levels.
   Methods: Histological sections of neck, thorax, and abdomen of 6.5 to 9 day quail embryos submitted to DOPA reaction (tyrosinase activity) were used. In four concentric areas-dorsal and ventrally subdivided-the relative density of MPC was determined by morphometric methods.
   Results: The relative regional density of MPC from their individualization as DOPA-positive putative pigment cells until their definitive seeding in the epidermis showed a progressively higher cell density from deeper to peripheral zones in all three levels studied, with peaks of cell density suggesting a centrifugal pattern occurring in at least; two waves of migratory cells.
   Conclusions: The spatial distribution of the MPC varies according to both the axial level and the developmental stage of the embryo. Furthermore, the general pattern of centrifugal distribution observed might be attributed to a different timing of cell differentiation closely related to their migratory behavior.

AB  - Different management regimes for 1-year rotational set-aside were tested in three experiments that followed winter wheat and started in autumn 1988-90. The regimes included operations that prevented the establishment of volunteers or allowed them to establish and persist until either spring or summer, and also altered the distribution of debris from the winter wheat that preceded the set-aside. For comparison, treatments in the set-aside year also included winter wheat.
   Samples taken in spring from the first test crop showed that there were few significant or consistent effects on leaf diseases of growing the wheat after different set-aside treatments or after winter wheat. There were significant effects of the set-aside treatments on root and stem base diseases but some of the effects, and the apparent absence of others, are not easily reconciled with current understanding of the biology of the pathogens concerned. In summer, eyespot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) was most severe after winter wheat and least severe after ryegrass. Severity after the other set-aside treatments did not differ significantly. There was more sharp eyespot (Rhizoctonia cerealis) in plots that had been ploughed at the start of the set-aside year, including those sown with winter wheat, than in those that had not. Brown foot rot (Fusarium st,p.) was equally severe where the wheat followed wheat or where it followed set-aside treatments that allowed volunteers to develop, and less so where the development of volunteers was prevented. Take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici) was most severe after winter wheat and more severe after set-aside treatments that allowed volunteers to develop and survive through the winter than after those that did not. Effects of ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum) on take-all in the following wheat were particularly variable, perhaps because ryegrass is a host of both the take-all fungus and of Phialophora graminicola, one of its principal antagonists.

AB  - The bad reputation of fungal taxonomy as being arbitrary and unstable is not justified. Molecular:data have contributed significantly towards establishing a more natural system with monophyletic taxa than hirtherto possible, as a basis for a stable taxonomy. Examples of successful separation of hitherro heterogeneous genera and of some, so far unresolved problems, are given. The application of molecular methods often leads to a refined species delimitation that takes genetical and biological differences into account.
   Nomenclature can be stabilized only to a certain extent, as far as name changes are not necessary to express systematic progress. Name changes for purely nomenclatural reasons can be avoided by the conservation of established names (or by rejection of disturbing older names).

AB  - Background Coronary stent restenosis is a growing clinical concern which, because restenosis may vary with stent design, requires a validated, accurate, and sensitive method of evaluation as new stents are developed. Histologic analysis of arterial cross sections, a highly accurate tool in animal models, has limited applicability in humans. Quantitative coronary angiography, while commonly used in the clinical evaluation of coronary interventions, has a controversial role as an adequate measure of restenosis, and few studies have validated quantitative angiography in diseased arteries. We tested the hypothesis that in-stent stenosis could be assessed as accurately by pre-mortem angiography as by post-mortem histology, allowing angiographic discrimination of variable late luminal loss provoked by stents of different designs.
   Methods and Results. Stent stenosis in porcine coronary arteries was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and histology at 3, 28 and 56 days. Four stainless steel stent designs were studied: a slotted tube configuration with or without a polymer wrap and a corrugated ring configuration with or without a polymer coating. Although acute luminal gain (mean stent:artery ratio 1.07 +/- 0.01) and stent recoil (mean stent diameter at follow-up 2.65 +/- 0.02 mm) were similar for all designs and time points, significant differences in late luminal loss were observed and were detected as accurately by angiography as by histology. At 28 days, the polymer wrapped slotted tube design resulted in a nearly two-fold greater late loss than its bare metal counterpart (1.40 +/- 0.09 mm vs. 0.80 +/- 0.12 mm, p < .001 by angiography; 1.33 +/- 0.10 mm vs. 0.67 +/- 0.06 mm, p < .0001 by histology), while there was no significant difference in 28 day late loss between the polymer coated and bare metal corrugated ring designs (p = NS by angiography or histology). Time point differences were also observed both angiographically and histologically, with marked progression of lumen loss between 3 and 28 days and slower but persistent progression between 28 and 56 days. Overall comparison of individual lumen diameter measurements for all stented arteries independent of design or duration of follow-up demonstrated a precise correlation between angiography and histology (y = 0.96x +0.25,p < .0001, r(2) = 0.82).
   Conclusions. Coronary stents of varied designs provoke markedly different degrees of late luminal loss, and these differences can be measured as accurately by quantitative angiography as by histologic analysis of arterial cross sections. This may be due to optimization of angiographic measurements by the concentric nature of intimal thickening in stented arteries, and to structural rigidity imparted by the stent, preserving arterial lumen size for histologic analysis. Quantitative angiography, therefore, may represent an adequate endpoint in clinical trials comparing stent designs.

AB  - Crater disease (CD) of wheat is caused by a Rhizoctonia solani strain of ambiguous phylogeny. Anastomosis reactions confirmed placement of CD-causing R. solani in anastomosis group (AG) 6, with results indicating a closer affinity to AG-6 GV than to AG-6 HG. Cultures of CD isolates were initially white to cream, turning a yellowish light brown after 10 days. Concentric rings of dark and light mycelium were evident from an early stage. Mycelium generally was appressed to the agar surface with sparse aerial growth. A few light-colored, irregularly shaped sclerotia could be discerned after 2 weeks. The mean hyphal diameter of CD-causing R. solani was 7.46 mu m (ranging from 5.0 to 10.0 mu m), and cells contained a mean number of four (ranging from two to eight) nuclei, compared to a mean hyphal diameter of 8.58 and 8.42 mu m and a mean nuclear number of six and four For AG-6 HG and AG-6 GV, respectively. The CD isolates had a slower growth rate (15.3 mm/day) than AG-6 HG (29.1 mm/day) and AG-6 GV (22.6 mm/day) but, like AG-6, were thiamine prototrophic. Conspicuous nodulose swellings were produced by CD-causing R. solani on roots of wheat, and infection resulted in retarded shoot growth. Smaller nodules were evident on bean and soybean roots. Fingerprint patterns generated for the various isolates with four enzymes, HpalI, Sau3AI, TaqI, and CfoI, showed the presence of a unique 610-bp fragment in the pathogen. It is proposed that CD-causing R. solani isolates represent a distinct intersterility group within AG-6 that is more related to subgroup GV than to subgroup HG.

AB  - A concentric microstrip triangular-ring antenna structure using the log-periodic principle for increasing the impedance bandwidth of the microstrip patch antenna is described, The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is applied to analyze the proposed structure. A special technique to model the slanted metallic boundaries of the triangular ring has been used in the general FDTD algorithm to avoid the staircase approximation. The method improves the accuracy of the original FDTD algorithm without increasing the complexity, The radiation patterns at different frequencies over wide-band width are obtained experimentally.

T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE

KW  - SHOCK METAMORPHISM
KW  - QUARTZ
AB  - About three decades ago, a formerly unknown genetic type of natural diamonds was discovered in impact craters. Impact diamonds are currently known from a number of impact structures in Europe, Asia and North America, and it's likely that the number of finds will increase with time. The Popigai crater, Northern Siberia, where impact diamonds were first found, was specifically Investigated in terms of geology, geophysics, petrography and mineralogy. Large resources of industrial impact diamonds were discovered, and these minerals were studied in detail.
   Authigenic impact diamonds occur in situ in shocked graphite-bearing gneisses that are found as inclusions in impact melt rocks: tagamites and suevites. According to the observed transformation of coexisting minerals, the lower estimated pressure of the coherent martensite transition of graphite to diamonds is 35 GPa. Impact diamonds inherit the original shape of graphite crystals and are composed of a polycrystalline structured aggregate of cubic and probably hexagonal carbon microcrystals 1-5 mu m across. Numerous properties of diamonds depend on the high density of defects in the crystal lattice. Allothigenic impact diamonds occur in rocks produced by the homogenization and solidification of impact melt, which originated from the complete fusion of graphite-bearing precursor gneisses. These diamonds usually reflect the influence of the hot melt and are strongly corroded.
   Diamond-bearing tagamites and suevites in the Popigai crater interior occur as extended lens and sheets bodies and also as irregular small bodies. Diamond distribution depends on the original abundance of precursor graphite in the target rocks, on the superimposed shock-metamorphic zonation, and on the character of the ejection of shocked and melted material along different trajectories and azimuths. This has resulted in radial and concentric inhomogeneities in diamond distribution in the crater interior. On a second order, the distribution depends on the scale of melt contamination by clasts and fragments and by the duration of cooling of certain melt bodies and their constituents. Enrichment in diamonds at the margins of thick tagamite sheets is the result of rapid cooling, which prevents combustion of diamonds. A positive correlation between diamond content and the amount of phosphorus pentoxide in impactites indicates links to C and P probably in organic matter of the primary sedimentary rocks, which were subjected to granulitic metamorphism 2.4 Ga ago and melted at the time of impact 35.7 Ma ago.

AB  - General expressions for the scattering functions of polydisperse particles with an arbitrary number of concentric shells of lamellar, cylindrical, or spherical symmetry are derived. For shells consisting of dense polymer layers or brushes with algebraic density profiles, phi(r) similar to r(alpha), it is possible to obtain closed analytical expressions by taking advantage of the mathematical properties of hypergeometric functions. The same formalism can be employed to derive a closed expression for the form factor of polydisperse excluded volume chains assuming a des Cloizeaux-type segment distribution function.

AB  - Two functionally and anatomically distinct types of lateral inhibition contribute to the receptive field organization of ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina: sustained lateral inhibition (SLI), which is present during steady illumination and transient lateral inhibition (TLI), evoked by changes in illumination. We studied adaptive changes in these two lateral inhibitory mechanisms in the mud-puppy puppy retina by measuring the responses of ON-OFF ganglion cells to spots of light in the receptive field center, in the absence and presence of a concentric broken annulus (windmill) pattern, which was either stationary or rotating. SLI was measured as the percent suppression of the centered spot response by the stationary windmill and TLI was measured as the additional suppression produced when the windmill was rotating. In dark-adapted retinas SLI was elicited by windmills of 600 or 1,200 mu m ID, but TLI could not be elicited by windmills of any size, over a wide range of windmill intensities and rotation rates. Exposure of dark-adapted retinas to diffuse adapting light caused an immediate decrease in the response to the spot alone, followed by slowly developing changes in both SLI and TLI: SLI produced by 1,200 mu m ID windmills became weaker, whereas SLI produced by 600 mu m ID windmills became stronger. After several minutes strong TLI could be elicited by both 600 and 1,200 mu m ID windmills. The changes in SLI and TLI were usually complete within 5 and 15 min, respectively, and recovered to dark-adapted levels slightly more slowly after the adapting light was turned off. However the changes in sensitivity of the spot response were complete within one minute after onset and termination of the adapting light. The adaptive changes in SLI and TLI did not depend on the presence of the adapting light; after a brief (1 min) exposure to the adapting light, the changes in SLI and TLI slowly developed and then decayed back to the dark-adapted level. The effects of the adapting light on SLI were mimicked by dopamine and blocked by D1 dopamine receptor antagonists. However dopamine did not enable TLI in dark-adapted retinas and dopamine antagonists did not prevent enablement of TLI when dark-adapted retinas were exposed to light or disable TLI when applied to light-adapted retinas. The results suggest that light-adaptive changes in SLI are mediated by dopamine and are consistent with a reduction in electrical coupling between neurons that conduct the SLI signal laterally in the retina. In contrast, TLI appears to be switched off or suppressed in the dark-adapted retina and enabled in light-adapted retinas, by a relatively slow modulatory mechanism that does not involve dopamine.

AB  - Spiral mandrel dies are commonly used for pipe and blown film extrusion. Despite their attractive properties they have not been used for wire-coating applications, because the feeding of the rather large number of spirals led to designs with unacceptably high pressure losses.
   A design procedure using only a few spiral channels avoids the aforementioned drawbacks and is suitable for wire-coating applications. Backed up by experimental data and a numerical flow analysis, excellent results in terms of concentricity and regularity can be obtained.

LA  - English
CP  - 1st North-American Conference on Multiphase Technology
AB  - This work presents two-phase gas and liquid flow in horizontal wells with perforation completion and radial inflow. The aim is to establish rational criteria for a perforation shot density which will allow the reservoir to be drained uniformly, in order to avoid gas or water coning. We consider only stratified wellbore flow, and the pressure loss between the reservoir and the well is assumed to take place in annular concentric zones surrounding the perforation cavities. This concept is based on the so-called horizontal-microwell model.
   The wellbore flow is modeled as one-dimensional, and the resulting equations are integrated numerically. Mean gas and liquid wellbore velocities, wellbore flowing pressure, liquid holdup fraction and perforation shot density as a function of position along the wellbore are calculated, and effects of production rates and formation permeability are included in the analysis.
   The results demonstrate that a uniform, perforation shot density can cause the reservoir to be drained at a higher rate at the downstream end of the wellbore than at the upstream end, and that the perforation shot density must decrease in a unique manner downstream in order to maintain a uniform production.

AB  - Background. In this study, using a murine model of aortic allotransplantation, the role of blockade of signaling through CD28/B7 and CD40/CD40 ligand costimulatory pathways in the evolvement of posttransplant vasculopathy was examined,
   Methods. Aortic allografts were transplanted across C57BL/10J (H2(b))-->C3H (H2(k)) strain combinations. Transient or more stable blockade of second signaling was achieved by either a single injection or multiple injections of CTLA4-Ig fusion protein (200 mu g/dose i.p.) and/or anti-CD40 ligand (CD40L) monoclonal antibody (250 mu g i.m.), At day 30 after transplantation, the grafts were harvested for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination,
   Results, Similar to allografts of untreated animals, aortic allografts obtained from recipients treated with either CTLA4-Ig or anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody alone exhibited marked narrowing of the lumen primarily due to concentric intimal thickening caused by proliferation of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells. Contemporaneous treatment, however, with either a single injection or multiple injections of CTLA4-Ig and anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody resulted in marked diminution of intimal thickening. Interestingly, concurrent prolonged inhibition of CD28/B7 and CD40/CD40L pathways resulted in complete abrogation of the development of posttransplant arteriopathy,
   Conclusion, These data suggest that a more stable disruption of signaling through costimulatory pathways may be required to obviate the development of posttransplant vasculopathy.

AB  - It was the aim of the present study to characterize the hemodynamic, biochemical and morphologic effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade on hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats, Isolated right ventricular hypertrophy was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by intermittent hypoxia (IH; 10% O-2, 8h/ day, 5 days/week, 20 days of exposition, n=15). After completion of IH, left- (LV) and right-ventricular (RV) hemodynamic parameters were measured under room air conditions in the intact, thiopental-anesthetized animals with special Millar ultraminiature tipcatheter-manometers. Cardiac output was determined using the thermodilution method, Cell volume (CV) of isolated cardiomyocytes was measured with a Coulter Channellyzer after collagenase cell isolation. The specific activities of the myocardial pentose phosphate pathway enzymes glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) and 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase (6-PGD) were determined using a spectrophotometric assay. IH caused a rise in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) from 38.1 +/- 0.83 to 58.1 +/- 1.42 mmHg and an increase in the RV weight/body weight ratio (RVW/BW) from 0.884 +/- 0.053 to 1.166 +/- 0.049 mg/g. The activities of G-6-PD and 6-PGD were significantly increased after IH in the RV, but not in the LV. CV was increased from 24 248 +/- 1193 to 29 541 +/- 1765 mu m(3), myocardial cell length was unchanged. IH had no influence on the LV parameters or cardiac output. Co-infusion of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (LO; 12 mg/kg/d.i.p., n = 14) during the IH period reduced the rises in RVSP (49.4 +/- 2.06 mmHg), RVW/ BW (0.99 +/- 0.072 mg/g), G-6-PD and 6-PGD significantly, but not completely. The increase in CV, however, was prevented (24 524 +/- 2370 mu m(3)) entirely, We conclude from these data that the IH-induced RV-hypertrophy was primarily of the concentric type, LO attenuated the hypoxia-induced isolated RV hypertrophy and significantly reduced the metabolic response of the RV. The LO effect was most potent with regard to the increase in cardiomyocyte volume. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The propagation behavior of chemical waves in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction was examined experimentally for the first time under microgravity conditions. This study was motivated by the work of Kondepudi and Prigogine (1981), who pointed out theoretically that a diffusion reaction system with nonlinear and nonequilibrium characteristics may receive a great amplification of the subtle effect of gravity on elementary reactions. In the present study, the free-fall facility at the Japan Microgravity Center in Hokkaido (JAMIC) was utilized to maintain a quality of 10(-5) g for about 10 s. To prevent convection due to surface tension, a thin planar vessel closed to air was used in both normal and microgravity runs. Concentric patterns induced spontaneously in the vessel fixed in the vertical position were elongated downward and shortened upward under normal gravity. Under microgravity, however, propagation speed was almost the same in traveling directions. To discuss the effect of convection, propagating speed in gel matrix was also observed in similar experiments under microgravity conditions, but no apparent influence was revealed.

AB  - This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.

AB  - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a troublesome long-term complication of heart transplantation. It is manifested by a unique and unusually accelerated form of coronary disease affecting both intramural and epicardial coronary arteries and veins. CAV is characterized by vascular injury induced by a variety of noxious stimuli, including the immune system response to the allograft, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infection, immunosuppressive drugs, and classic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. The obstructive vascular lesions are thought to progress through repetitive endothelial injury followed by repair response. The role of major histocompatibility complex donor-recipient differences in the pathogenesis of CAV has not yet been completely elucidated. Intracoronary ultrasound studies reveal a dual morphology with donor-transmitted or de novo focal, noncircumferential plaques in proximal segments and/or a diffuse, concentric pattern observed in distal segments. A lack of correlation between microvascular and epicardial vessel disease suggests discordant manifestations and progression of CAV. Apoptosis and loss of functional vascular remodeling have to be considered as important mediators of clinically relevant CAV. Strategies for blocking T-cell costimulation and expression of adhesion molecules may help prevent chronic rejection in clinical transplantation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and antiproliferative drugs may slow progression of CAV by various effects. Methods to augment endogenous nitric oxide bioavailability as well as newer immunosuppressive regimens may be protective. Balloon angioplasty has a limited role in the treatment of focal lesions. Experiences with coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass grafting, and transmyocardial laser revascularization are limited. Retransplantation has a worse outcome than initial transplantation.

AB  - The African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, normally possesses circular eyespots on its wings. Artificial selection lines, which express ellipsoidal eyespots on the dorsal surface of the forewing, were used to investigate correlated changes in wing shape. Morphometric analysis of linear wing measurements and wing scale counts provided evidence that eyespot shape was correlated with localised shape changes in the corresponding wing-cell, with overall shape changes in the vying, and with the density/arrangement of scales around the eyespot area.

AB  - By using a real-time assay that allows measurement of the phototactic orientation of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas with millisecond time resolution, it can be shown that single photons not only induce transient direction changes but that fluence rates as low as 1 photon cell(-1) s(-1) can already lead to a persistent orientation. Orientation is a binary variable, i.e., in a partially oriented population some organisms are fully oriented while the rest are still at random. Action spectra reveal that the response to a pulsed stimulus follows the Dartnall-nomogram for a rhodopsin while the response to a persistent stimulus falls off more rapidly toward the red end of the spectrum. Thus light of 540 nm, for which chlamy-rhodopsin is equally sensitive as for 440-nm light, induces no measurable persistent orientation while 440-nm light does. A model is presented which explains not only this behavior, but also how Chlamydomonas can track the light direction and switches between a positive and negative phototaxis. According to the model the ability to detect the direction of light, to make the right turn and to stay oriented, is a direct consequence of the helical path of the organism, the orientation of its eyespot relative to the helix-axis, and the special shielding properties of eyespot and cell body. The model places particular emphasis on the fact that prolonged swimming into the correct direction not only requires making a correct turn initially, but also avoiding further turns once the right direction has been reached.

AB  - The butterfly Bicyclus anynana has a series of distal eyespots on its wings. Each eyespot is composed of a white pupil, a black disc, and a gold outer ring. We applied artificial selection to the large dorsal eyespot on the forewing to produce a line with the gold ring reduced or absent (BLACK) and another line with a reduced black disc and a broad gold ring (GOLD). High heritabilities, coupled with a rapid response to selection, produced two lines of butterflies with very different phenotypes. Other eyespots showed a correlated change in the proportion of their color rings. Surgical experiments were: performed on pupal wings from the different lines at the time of eyespot pattern specification. They showed that the additive genetic variance for this trait was in the response of the wing epidermis to signaling from the organizing cells at the eyespot center (the focus). This response was found to vary across different regions of the wing and also between the sexes. The particular eyespot color composition found for each sex, as well as the maintenance of the high genetic variation, are discussed with reference to the ecology of the butterfly, sexual selection, and visual selection by predators.

TI  - Analysis of a compliant honing tool for brushing cylindrical surfaces
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, a mechanics-based model is developed and used for analyzing the steady-state configuration of brush fibers during concentric brushing of a cylindrical surface. The geometry of the problem is generalized in order to facilitate the analysis of flexible honing tools, that is, brushing tools having a spherical volume of abrasive compound attacked at the end of each fiber. The integrity of the model is evaluated by examining two special cases that have a known solution, namely, (i) quasistatic contact, and (ii) dynamic contact associated with successively reduced fiber stiffness. In each case, correct results are obtained for the contact forces generated at the interface of the filament tip/cylindrical workpart surface. Also, special attention is given to examining the role that brush rotational speed plays in the response of each fiber of the honing tool, including filament/workpart contact force, torque, and filament stress.

AB  - High sodium diet (HS, 8% NaCl) induces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in normotensive rats without an increase in pressure or volume load or in resting cardiac sympathetic activity. HS may affect LV adrenoceptors density or affinity or their postreceptor pathways, thereby causing LVH. We therefore assessed the effects of HS with and without blockade of alpha(1)- or beta-adrenoceptors by terazosin or nadolol, alone or in combination, on resting hemodynamics, LV and right ventricular (RV) weights, and LV dimensions of male WKY rats.
   HS increased LV weight by 14% to 17%, and the ratio of LV wall thickness to radius by 18% to 23%. Singly or in combination, the adrenoceptor antagonists did not prevent HS-induced LVH, but instead aggravated it. The increased ratio of LV wall thickness to radius and of LV to RV were attenuated by terazosin or nadolol alone. Neither the resting LV peak-systolic or end-diastolic pressures nor the right atrial pressure was changed by HS, either alone or in combination with the blockers.
   The failure of chronic alpha(1)- or beta-blockade to prevent HS-induced LVH suggests that adrenoceptor activation is not important in evoking the LVH. However, the blockers shifted the LVH from a concentric to an eccentric form, suggesting an involvement of additional trophic factors during adrenoceptor blockade.

AB  - The diagnosis of malingering and functional visual loss should be proven by specific tests - after the exclusion of differential diagnoses such as optical disturbances, amblyopia, early stages of macula and optic nerve disease and cortical lesions. Malingering and functional visual loss are based on different causes and pathogenetic mechanisms. However, they produce the same symptoms and can therefore be examined by the same methods.
   The strategy consists of three parts: 1) check the reproducability of the results, 2) specific procedures: provocation of reflectory responses, deception, measurement of the same function with different methods and objective methods and 3) proof.
   In alleged bilateral blindness the provocation of reflexes and deceptive strategies are especially useful, in alleged bilateral reduction of visual acuity deceptive methods (related to the size of the optotype), the examination of central vision by other methods (equivalents to visual acuity) and objective methods are applied. In alleged monolateral blindness or reduction of visual acuity the binocular tests are valuable. Additionally, methods to provoke reflexes, especially pupil reaction, are used as well as the measure of equivalents to visual acuity.
   In alleged concentric constriction of the visual fields three strategies are mainly used: 1) check if visual field size is in accordance with the visual angle, 2) different methods to examine the isopters and 3) different perimetric methods. In case of an alleged hemianopic field defect the following methods are of special value: 1) binocular examination, 2) reading ability, 3) different perimetric methods and 4) half-field stimulation.
   After finishing the specific tests the diagnosis of malingering or functional visual loss should be unambiguous and the existing function should be determined. Strategies for further management are shown - dependent on the pathogenesis: the aim is to avoid repetition and to set the right course for the future. In cases of malingering the reliable expert's report is helpful. In case of functional visual loss it is important to avoid unnecessary examinations and to offer specific aids.

AB  - To evaluate differences in shoulder strength and range of motion between painful and pain-free shoulders we examined two matched groups of athletes. Fifteen competitive swimmers were allocated to two groups. Group 1 consisted of seven swimmers with unilateral shoulder pain related to swimming (Neer and Welsh phase I to II). The control group (Group 2) consisted of eight swimmers with no present or previous history of shoulder pain. Concentric and eccentric internal rotational torques were reduced in painful shoulders in between-group comparisons as well as in side-to-side comparisons. The decrease in internal rotational torque resulted in significantly greater concentric and eccentric external-to-internal rotational strength ratios of the painful shoulder in Group 1 swimmers compared with the controls. Furthermore, the functional ratio (eccentric external rotation:concentric internal rotation) was significantly greater in the painful shoulder in both between-group and side-to-side comparisons. Both groups of swimmers exhibited increased external range of motion and reduced internal range of motion compared with normalized data, but no between-group or side-to-side differences were detected. Our findings suggest that prevention or rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder might not solely involve strengthening of the external rotators of the shoulder joint. Attention might also be drawn toward correction of a possible deficit in internal rotational strength. Changes in shoulder range of motion seem unrelated to the occurrence of shoulder pain.

T2  - NATURE

AB  - Molecular species containing metal-metal bonds have been known for a long time(1). But these have generally involved transition metals; metal-metal bonds between main-group elements were discovered only more recently(2). Within the past decade, polyhedral Al-4, Al-12 and Ga-4 species have all been characterized by X-ray diffraction(3,4), and the chemistry of low-valent polynuclear Al species in particular has nourished owing to the development of condensation techniques for preparing them by disproportionation of aluminium monohalides(4). By using this approach, we now report the identification and characterization of an Al-77 cluster, which is dramatically larger than any seen hitherto and can be considered an intermediate species to the formation of the bulk metal, X-ray diffraction shows that the cluster has a central Al atom surrounded by three concentric polyhedral shells containing 12, 44 and 20 Al atoms. This Al-77 core is stabilized by 20 organic ligands, preventing the formation of the bulk metal, Studies of such clusters should provide insights into the crossover between molecular species and the bulk metal for main-group elements.

AB  - Concentrically zoned phosphatic-enriched concretions were collected at three sites from the Monterey Formation. The following minerals were identified: vivianite, lipscombite, rockbridgeite, leucophosphite, mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite, nontronite, todorokite, and barite. The mineralogy of the concretions was slightly different at each of the three collection sites. None of the concretions contains all of the minerals, but the spatial distribution of minerals in individual concretions, overlapping mineralogies between different concretions, and the geochemical properties of the separate minerals suggest a paragenesis represented by the above order. Eh increased from the precipitation of vivianite to that of rockbridgeite/lips combite. The precipitation of leucophosphite, then mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite and todorokite/Fe-oxide indicates increasing pH. Concretion growth culminated with the precipitation of todorokite, a Mn oxide, and minor amounts of barite along microfractures. Conspicuously absent are Fe-sulfide and Mn-phosphate minerals. The concretions are hosted by finely laminated diatomite. The laminations exhibit little to no deformation around the concretions, requiring that the concretions formed after compaction. We interpret this sediment feature and the paragenesis as recording the evolving pore-water chemistry as the formation was uplifted into the fresh-ground-water zone.

KW  - MODEL
AB  - The normally circular eyespots on the wing of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana were selected to become elliptical in two divergent lines, with antero-posterior elongation of the eyespots in one line and proximodistal elongation in the other. Selection was continued for nine generations, and symmetrical realized heritabilities of similar to 15% were achieved initially. The elliptical eyespot shapes characteristic of each line were still produced when the signaling center of the eyespot (the focus) was surgically rotated by 90 or 180 degrees or when an eyespot was induced ectopically by localized damage. We conclude that selection changed general properties of the epidermis that responds to signals emanating from the eyespot focus but did not affect the mechanism of focal signaling.

AB  - Mature spermatozoa of Crocodylus johnstoni are filiform with a curved head, consisting, of acrosome complex (length 5.6 mu m) and nucleus (length 10.7 mu m); midpiece (length 4.8 mu m); and elongate tail (length 43-61 mu m). The acrosome vesicle and underlying subacrosomal material form a conical sheath around the anterior tapered nuclear rostrum. One to three endonuclear canals, each containing putative perforatorial material, extend posteriorly from the tip of the nuclear rostrum for approximately 5 mu m, nearly half the length of the nucleus. The midpiece is composed of 11 oblique rings of varying regularity each usually of six mitochondria, surrounding the elongate distal centriole. The mitochondria are subspheroidal to slightly elongate and possess few septate to (more externally) concentric cristae; a central dense body reported for Caiman crocodilus is questionably present. Nine peripheral dense fibres, closely associated with the triplets of the distal centriole, are lost within the anterior principal piece; those at doublets 3 and 8 are the longest and are separated from their doublers in the principal piece, as in other reptiles. A well defined annulus separates the midpiece from the principal piece. The principal piece consists of a 9+2 axoneme, investing fibrous sheath and plasma membrane and is followed by the endpiece which lacks the fibrous sheath. The spermatozoon of C. johnstoni is apomorphic relative to Chelonia and Sphenodon in reduction of concentric mitochondrial cristae but is less similar to that of ratites than is that of Caiman crocodilus, differing from ratites in the longer, multiplied perforatoria. The compact dense sheath around the central singlets of the distal centriole is a possible crocodilian autapomorphy.

A recent study on butterfly eyespots((1)) pinpoints the surprisingly simple regulatory cascade controlling such an apparently complex phenotype. The implications go beyond the elucidation of a fascinating developmental pathway, into the mechanisms and tempo of speciation and macroevolution.

AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is attacked by many parasitic fungi which often occur in mixed infections. Monitoring of these phytopathogens by morphological criteria is restricted due to their appearance especially in the later stages of disease development.
   We have developed molecular markers for a clear-cut differentiation of a variety of rape seed pathogenic fungi based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Twenty polymorphic fragments have been selected in Southern hybridization experiments to test their taxon-specificity. In summary, only four amplification products gave unspecific cross-hybridization patterns, one fragment corresponds to a genetic element common to three species within the genus Alternaria, and 15 RAPD markers were highly specific for distinct fungal species. This report demonstrates the value of the RAPD-PCR technique to amplify taxon-specific DNA fragments that can be used as hybridization probes for the diagnosis of a variety of rape seed pathogens (Alternaria brassicae, A. brassicicola, A. raphani; Cylindrosporium concentricum; Fusarium moniliforme; Phoma lingam; Pythium sp.; Rhizoctonia solani; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; Verticillium dahliae, V. latericium).

AB  - Surface mapping, deep borehole intersections and geophysical data indicate the existence of a conspicuous set of spatially and genetically related structural forms, centered around the town of Vredefort in South Africa. The structure consists of a central granitic core, surrounded by concentrically arranged folds and faults that affect strata of sedimentary and volcanic origin. It is demonstrated that the structure conforms to that of the root zone of a multi-ring impact basin. ''Vredefort-related'' characteristics, typical of structures of this kind, are highlighted and brought into their evolutionary perspective. Impact occurred at the end of the period of igneous activity that marked the emplacement of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, approximately 2000 Ma ago. Most traces of a stage of modification of the original transient crater were removed by erosion and the remnant structural forms reflect mainly the effects of centripetally outward directed, horizontally orientated stress. The morphology of the structure was eventually modified by later tectonic movement, and isostatic adjustment.

AB  - The spermatozoa of Potamon fluviatile and P. ibericum are virtually indistinguishable and do not support separate subgeneric rank (Potamon and Pontipotamon, respectively). Synapomorphic with the spermatozoa of the South African freshwater crab Potamonautes perlatus sidneyi are the elongation of the two centrioles and disposition of the centrioles almost parallel to each other, unknown elsewhere in the Brachyura, and reduction of the thickened ring (homoplasic with grapsids and gecarcinids). Other, probably synapomorphic, similarities of Potamon and Potamonautes include the wide inner acrosome zone, absence of a definite acrosome ray zone (homoplasic in other families) and the cleistospermial spermatophores. Further similarities, of questionable polarity, are the simple, not multilaminar, nuclear membrane and the tendency of the nuclear arms to wrap around the nucleus. Differences of Potamon From Potamonautes, which possibly support their present generic separation and give weak support to their former separate familial placement in the Potamidae and Potamonautidae respectively, are perforation of the operculum and the weak, rather than strong, development of a periopercular rim. Absence in Potamon and Potamonautes of an accessory opercular ring and a xanthid ring separates them from xanthids. No close affinities with other heterotreme families are seen but their assignment to the Heterotremata is not in doubt. Their spermatozoa lack two of the distinctive features of thoracotreme spermatozoa (apical button on the operculum and concentric lamellation of the outer acrosome zone). No clear correlates of spermatozoon structure with a freshwater existence are recognizable but reduction of the thickened ring possibly relates to peculiarities of the acrosome reaction. However, the production of spermatophores with single spermatozoa (cleistospermia) is possibly a device to prevent polyspermy and wastage of the small number of lecithotrophic eggs produced in potamids.

AB  - Experimental approaches to color pattern formation of lepidopteran insects have been made exclusively by analyzing pattern alterations in adult wings induced by operations. We microcauterized the presumptive black region of the dorsal forewing of the butterfly Pieris rapae and analyzed not only the resultant color pattern in the adult wing but also the cell behavior in the pupal wing epidermis around the injury. Cautery induced color alterations were as follows: (i) cautery up to 49.5 h after pupation resulted in white regions appearing within the black region while later cauteries induced larger white regions; (ii) cautery between 50 and 59.5 h resulted in the white regions induced by the cauteries being dramatically decreased; (iii) cautery after 60 h resulted in white regions that had almost disappeared. The examination of the cell behavior in the pupal wing epidermis after cauteries showed that the row formation of scale precursor cells was delayed. This delayed area varied with the time of cautery, in the same manner as that in the induced white area in the adult wing ((i)-(iii) above). The relationship between scale color alteration and the developmental delay of the scale row formation is discussed.

AB  - The Orpheus pavements of Roman Britain form a unique group in the mosaic art of the Empire. The series of floors, in which concentric registers of mammals and birds circle around Orpheus, who charms them with his lyre, appears first in the Cirencester region but is taken up by other workshops. The type conflates a local hunting deity popular in south-western Britain with the singer of classical myth. The discovery, recording and history of the Newton St Loe pavement are described. An account of recent work by ASPROM is given and concern about the pavement's conservation, display and future expressed.

AB  - Detailed mathematical models have been developed for the functioning of CO2 concentration mechanisms in microalgae. The models treat a microalgal cell as several compartments: pyrenoid, chloroplast stroma, cytoplasm and periplasmic space. Cases for both the active bicarbonate transport through the plasmalemma and the passive CO2 diffusion through it with the subsequent concentrating of CO2 inside the chloroplast are analyzed. CO2 evolution from bicarbonate inside the pyrenoid is modeled. The great diffusion resistance for CO2 flux from the pyrenoid is caused by a starch envelope and the concentric thylakoid membranes surrounding it. The role of carbonic anhydrase in the periplasmic space, cytoplasm and inside the chloroplast is evaluated numerically. The models also offer an explanation for the absence of 'short-circuited' inorganic carbon fluxes between the external medium and the cytoplasm under active bicarbonate transport through the plasmalemma and in the presence of carbonic anhydrase in the cytoplasm. If the cytoplasm is driven from the space between a chloroplast envelope and plasmalemma upon the microalgae adaptation to low concentration of the dissolved inorganic carbon, the inorganic carbon leak might be avoided. The models reproduce accurately the majority of known experimental data. The high efficiency of CO2 concentrating mechanisms in microalgae can be explained by a considerable diffusion resistance for CO2 flux from the pyrenoid and by the effective scavenging of CO2 leaking outward from the chloroplast to cytoplasm and from cell to periplasmic space.

AB  - Blemishing is a major duality defect of persimmon both in Australia and New Zealand. Several studies were conducted on the incidence and development of blemish in 4 well-managed orchards in both countries. Over 10 different types of blemishing were identified and documented. Of the blemishes identified, wind rub caused the greatest reduction in marketable fruit. The occurrence of this disorder was 5 times higher in Australia than in New Zealand in spite of windrun in New Zealand being 2-2.5 time higher than in Australia. The lower incidence of wind rub in New Zealand appears to be due to the use of Y trellising, whereas, in Australia, trees are free-standing. The incidence of sunburn varied markedly with season. The incidence of this disorder was reduced by bird-netting (5-15% shade factor) which is the standard management practise in Australia. Line, apex and concentric cracking were minor problems in most orchards. Methods for controlling blemishing in commercial orchards are outlined.

AB  - Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) have been commercially available for almost 10 years, and although they have many attractive properties their use is limited almost entirely to injection molded parts. The reasons LCPs are not extruded into films stem from the strong influence of shear to orient the polymer in the direction of flow, combined with very long relaxation time which prevents the induced orientation from randomizing after melt extrusion. This paper will explain how transverse shear can be used effectively to orient LCP films in multiple directions, making the film useful for applications including printed circuit board substrates and high barrier packaging. A machine for producing flat multiaxially oriented LCP film has been developed, using concentric rotating surfaces to orient the LCP during a single extrusion step.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a data base on the isokinetic eccentric muscular performance characteristics of external and internal rotator muscles in the shoulders of professional baseball pitchers. Concentric data are also included and compared with previously published concentric studies. Twenty-five professional baseball pitchers were evaluated with a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer. The subjects tested had a mean age of 23.5 years and a mean body weight of 199 pounds, Eccentric and concentric isokinetic tests were performed at 60 and 120 deg/sec. The testing protocol was standardized for each subject. Test results indicated no statistically significant difference in mean torque between throwing and nonthrowing shoulders for either external or internal rotator muscle groups, Eccentric strength was significantly greater than concentric strength for all muscle groups tested, The external-to-internal rotator muscle strength ratios were well above those previously published for high school through professional pitchers. Mean torque-to-lean body weight ratios were also included to establish a data base. This study establishes one of the first data bases for eccentric isokinetic muscle strength of shoulder rotator muscles in professional baseball pitchers. The data may help clinicians prevent and rehabilitate shoulder injuries in professional throwing athletes.

AB  - Temperature-induced variation and norms of reaction have been analyzed for wing pattern elements of six species belonging to the African butterfly genus Bicyclus (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae). Five of these species are sympatric in Malawi and exhibit seasonal polyphenism in the savannah-rainforest ecotone. The sixth species originated from Cameroonian equatorial rainforest. The organisms were laboratory reared under four different temperature conditions ranging from 17-28 degrees C.
   The variation in response to temperature is described by principal component analysis (PCA). Discrimination on the basis of plastic wing pattern characters was performed by discriminant function analysis (DFA) and unweighed pair-group method algorithm (UPGMA) clustering. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on adaptive plastic wing characters was compared with a cladogram built on ''nonadaptive'' characters.
   Results demonstrate that: (1) Phenotypic plasticity of wing pattern characters in response to temperature in laboratory-reared organisms is reminiscent of variation induced by seasonal change in the field. (2) Different wing pattern characters are under different control. ''exposed'' characters of butterflies at rest position an highly sensitive to temperature variation, whereas ''hidden'' characters, only visible during active behavior, are dominated by species differences. In general the sensitivity of the former can be attributed to their proposed function in deflecting predators. (3) The sexes differ especially in the size of those eyespots that are displayed during active behavior. (4) Species from seasonal and aseasonal environments react in a broadly similar manner to temperature variation. However, savannah species and species of aseasonal rainforest exhibit relatively shallow reaction norms, whereas reaction norms are steeper in species from the savannah-rainforest ecotone. Such a strong response was also apparent in so-called correlation networks between principal components for these species. (5) Phylogenetic distances are to some extent reflected in ordination in both PCA-space and DFA-space: closely related species of the safitza group remain close in both ordinations. The more distantly related species differ in ordination from a pattern as suggested by a phylogenetic reconstruction. it is argued that the wing pattern variation of these species reflects both adaptive processes and historical relationships.

AB  - Strange attractor dimensions were determined for two concentric areas of about 220 km (2 degrees) and 440 km (4 degrees) radii around WWSSN station at Shillong based on earthquake data during the period 1964 to 1992. Existence of deterministic chaos for both the areas was supported by the same fractal dimension of 6.1 and positive value of the largest Lyapunov exponent. The results have provided justification for delineating precursory seismicity patterns based on earthquakes up to epicentral distance of 440 km on different fault systems.
   Conspicuous higher value of the strange attractor dimension in Hindukush, Himalaya and northeast India than that in Koyna region in the peninsular India suggests a new criteria for distinction between interplate and intraplate earthquakes. Differences with subduction zone in Pacific vis-a-vis stress drop in great earthquakes (M greater than or equal to 8) and implications of the chaotic approach in earthquake hazard analysis have also been brought out.

AB  - We measured fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for a series of eyespots on left and right wings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. F1 offspring were reared in favourable conditions from two groups of selected parents with comparatively low and high FA, respectively. The data suggest that eyespots under strong visual selection from predators may show reduced FA. The results showed no indication of heritable variation for FA and no correlation in FA across eyespots within individuals. An additional experiment showed that a mutant allele specified a novel eyespot which tended to be more asymmetric. Our results indicate that caution is necessary in using FA of specific traits as some genome-level index of developmental stability.

AB  - Random amplified polymorphic DNA assays were carried out on a range of isolates of Rhizoctonia cerealis to identify markers common to all isolates, Two fragments were isolated, cloned and used to probe Southern blots of DNA from R. cerealis and isolates from a range of anastomosis groups of Rhizoctonia solani. The two fragments hybridized specifically to DNA of R. cerealis and not to DNA of any of the isolates of R. solani. Both fragments were partially sequenced and two pairs of primers were generated for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplification of a fragment of the anticipated size occurred following PCR of all isolates of R. cerealis and not from any of a range of fungal species associated with disease of the stem base of cereals. The primer pairs for R. cerealis were also used, along with those for Microdochium nivale and W and R-type of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, to detect these pathogens in extracts from field-grown wheat plants exhibiting symptoms of sharp eyespot, eyespot, foot rot or a combination of the diseases. No relationship was found between visual disease assessment of sharp eyespot at growth stage 37 and the results of PCR. However, the results of PCR and visual disease assessment al growth stage 75 were similar, indicating that visual disease assessment may not be reliable until later growth stages. This system offers the potential to detect the presence of R. cerealis in cereals and avoid problems commonly associated with conventional diagnosis of this disease and isolation of the pathogen.

AB  - The distribution pattern of the tree frog (Hyla arborea) in an intensively used agricultural landscape in Zealand Flanders, was analyzed for effects of habitat fragmentation. The logistic regression models showed that the chance that a pond (potential reproduction site) was occupied by tree frogs depended on three isolation factors. The density of ponds within 750 m of the occupied pond was higher compared to ponds that remained unoccupied during the survey period. Additionally both the density of shrubs as well as the density of high herbs, two terrestrial habitat factors, was higher within 1000 m of occupied ponds. The explanatory value of two different types of isolation measures was compared with logistic regression analysis. It is discussed that 'Concentric isolation measures', which take size and distance of potential habitat patches in all directions into account, are expected to give a better description of isolation than the more often used 'distance from the nearest habitat patch'.

AB  - We report a case of proliferating tricholemmal cyst, which made difficulties in the cytological analysis of the fine-needle biopsy aspirates This rare dermatopathologic entity is a possible diagnostic pitfall due to its close cytological resemblance to squamous cell carcinoma - the abundance of material, with predominance of squamoid cells, which form concentric structures (so-called squamous eddies), that simulate keratin pearls of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. However, careful and strict application of the cytological criteria prevents overdiagnosis; the small squamous cells that predominate in the smears occur mainly in clusters and sheets, they do not show prominent atypia, and the squamous eddies may not undergo complete keratinization.

AB  - Farmers are provided with simple methods to carry out disease risk assessments in individual fields which enable them to make decisions on the need for fungicide treatment. Assessment of mildew (Erysisphe graminis) and rust (Puccinia striiformis) incidence is on whole plants until growth stage 32 (GS 32). At later stages, assessments are only made on the three upper leaves. Risk of eyespot (Tapesia yallundae) is estimated in spring either using agronomic data, disease incidence or a combination of both. Risk evaluation of the septoria diseases Leptosphaeria modorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola is based on days with precipitation of more than 1 mm per day and the susceptibility of varieties. In Denmark, the decision support system PC-Plant Protection is used to combine information on thresholds with recommendations for treatments using adjusted fungicide dosages. Weekly reports on disease attack in winter wheat are made on a national level by the Danish Agricultural Advisory Centre. At 55 localities, 2-5 varieties are assessed. This information Indicates the general disease situation in the whole country, in different regions and varieties. On a national level, maps are also generated giving accumulated values for precipitation and temperatures. A field monitoring system run in the period 1985-1993 provided actual information on the level of pests and diseases in Denmark, as well as data on yearly variations in the need for fungicide treatments, based on data collected from farmers' field assessments.

AB  - In the present study we used the dual probe approach to investigate striatal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation of GABA release from the substantia nigra pars reticulata of the awake, freely moving rat. One microdialysis probe of concentric design was implanted in the dorsolateral striatum and another in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata. Perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 mu M) in the dorsolateral striatum decreased local dopamine release (-25%) and increased both glutamate (+40%) and GABA (+35%) release. Moreover, perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 mu M) in the dorsolateral striatum increased GABA release (+20%) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Perfusion with the lower (10 mu M) N-methyl-D-aspartate concentration in the dorsolateral striatum did not affect striatal dopamine, glutamate and GABA release or nigral GABA release. Intrastriatal perfusion with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (10 mu M), at a dose which by itself did not affect basal striatal or nigral neurotransmitter levels, prevented the effects of striatal perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate on both striatal and nigral neurotransmitter release. Intrastriatal dizocilpine maleate was also perfused concurrently with intranigral tetrodotoxin (10 mu M) (see accompanying paper). Intrastriatal perfusion with dizocilpine maleate prevented the tetrodotoxin-induced rise in both striatal and nigral GABA levels and profoundly reduced the tetrodotoxin-induced contralateral turning. In addition, intrastriatal dizocilpine maleate delayed the increase in striatal glutamate release evoked by intranigral tetrodotoxin without affecting the associated decrease in striatal dopamine release.
   The present study demonstrates that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the dorsolateral striatum regulate GABA release in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of the awake rat and provides evidence that this regulation plays a key role in motor function.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to monitor activity and movement of Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), in a small-farm ecosystem. Moth activity was determined using sticky traps placed in bin vents of storage bins containing shelled corn and pheromone traps placed in concentric circles across the farm with the bins at the center. Moth activity was concentrated in and around the grain bins fr om June to August and at cent plots in September and October. Mark-recapture studies confirmed moth dispersal from the bins to corn plots during July-September. Knowledge of the spatial dynamics of Angoumois grain moth may contribute to pest management programs.

AB  - In rats vertically implanted with concentric dialysis probes in the medial prefrontal cortex and in the medial nucleus accumbens, morphine, ethanol and nicotine failed to modify extracellular dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex at doses that were fully effective in raising extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, the aversive/anxiogenic drugs picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol and FG 7142, administered at subconvulsant doses, increased extracellular dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex but failed to do so in the nucleus accumbens. Systemic administration of low doses of the 5HT(3) antagonist ICS 205930, previously reported to prevent the increase of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens elicited by morphine, nicotine, ethanol and haloperidol (Carboni et al. 1989) as well as by stress (Imperato et al. 1990), also prevented the increase of extracellular dopamine elicited in the prefrontal cortex by anxiogenic drugs. Therefore, mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine neurons show clear-cut differences in the reactivity to drugs of abuse and to aversive drugs but are both modulated by a facilitatory serotonergic input mediated by 5HT(3) receptors.

Concentric-cylinder and parallel-plate geometries were used to measure shear stress versus shear rate. Precautions required to avoid Taylor vortices and the correction of wall slip were addressed. The blade-vane geometry was used for direct measurement of yield stress and compared with extrapolated values obtained from the concentric-cylinder and parallel-plate measurements. Consistent results were obtained with these different laboratory viscometers.

KW  - BIRDSFOOT-TREFOIL
AB  - Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) is a valuable forage legume. Rhizomatous L. corniculatus germplasm from Morocco was recently discovered. Increased persistence may result from rhizomatous habit, because new plants vegetatively generated by rhizomes could replace diseased or dead plants. Rhizome morphology in L. corniculatus from Morocco is unique because taxonomic descriptions for L. corniculatus do not include the presence of rhizomes. The objectives of this study are to describe and compare morphology and anatomy of subterranean lateral shoots (rhizomes) and aerial shoots (stems) of L. corniculatus. Rhizomes of Moroccan L. corniculatus are initiated from axillary buds on basal portions of shoots. The rhizome consists of nodes and internodes, with buds, scale leaves, and adventitious roots occurring at each node. Anatomically, the rhizome of L. corniculatus has a large cortex, small pith, and six to seven primary vascular bundles. Na endodermis exists in the cortex, and parenchyma cells contain starch. In contrast, the aerial shoot of L. corniculatus has a small cortex, large pith, and nine to 10 primary vascular bundles. An endodermoid layer is peripheral to the concentric ring of vascular bundles of the aerial shoot, and parenchyma cells in the cortex contain chloroplasts. Morphological and anatomical differences between L. corniculatus rhizomes and aerial shoots are distinguishable.

AB  - A sample of full-trained adult male peacocks was collected and measured to determine whether or not there were any morphological correlates of train elaboration. Peacocks with longer or heavier trains are those with relatively large fat reserves for their overall body mass. The proportion of feathers in the train which have eyespots is also greater in peacocks with a relatively large muscle. These relationships indicate that train elaboration may be condition-dependent. Females that prefer males with larger trains may therefore gain good condition males, which may reflect overall genetic quality. There is also a significant tendency for larger trained peacocks to have high louse loads, after controlling for body mass. It may be that larger-trained males are older, and have accrued more lice than younger ones. Alternatively, long-trained males may have acquired more lice through direct contact with more females than shorter-trained birds.

AB  - Studies of CNS processing of olfactory information have contributed significantly to understanding olfactory-guided behaviour in insects. Evidence in moths suggests that each glomerulus in the antennal lobes has a unique property: receptor-axon projections and dendritic arborizations of uniglomerular output neurons can relate to anatomically and functionally distinct glomeruli. Similar correlations are not typical of the concentrically organized locust antennal lobes. Insights about odour processing in the CNS of female mosquitoes should help us to understand how sensory information can lead to host-seeking behaviour. It will be interesting to learn how inputs from CO2 receptors on the maxillary palps and inputs from antennal olfactory receptors that respond to host odours are integrated centrally, so that pharmacological manipulation of olfactory neuron activity might provide a tool for the control of mosquitoes as important vector insects. The antennal lobe of male and female Aedes aegypti contains 20-25 glomeruli. Primary afferent projections from the antennae and maxillary palps target specific glomeruli of the ipsilateral antennal lobe. Maxillary palp projections are restricted to two posteromedial glomeruli, which do not receive antennal afferents. The latter arborize in the remaining glomeruli.

AB  - Routine collections of leafroller larvae in Washington apple orchards for the purposes of assessing the kinds of parasites and levels of parasitism revealed the presence of an unknown species. Specimens sent to the USDA-ARS Systematic Entomology Laboratory, Beltsville, were identified as Colpoclypeus florus (Walker). This report represents an extension of its geographic range, the first record in the U.S., as well as a new host record. Colpoclypeus florus is a gregarious ectoparasitic eulophid which is widely distributed in Europe where it is the most common natural enemy of tortricids in orchards and other crops. It was introduced into Canada and released in small numbers in 1966 and 1967. No recovery was reported until 1992 when it was reared from larvae of obliquebanded leafroller and eyespotted bud moth in Ontario. In that same year the level of parasitism by C. florus in two unsprayed apple orchards in Washington was 66% and 75%. The parasite's behavior and key characters that indicate its possible presence in an orchard are discussed. Notes on the distribution in Washington and methods of rearing C.florus on pandemis leafroller larvae are described, along with its potential as a biological control agent in Washington.

AB  - The results of trials conducted in 1987-1990 were analysed to investigate the relationship between winter wheat yields and infection with the Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides fungus. The loss of grain yield depends mainly on the intensity of the disease.
   Slight eyespot lesions are not damaging and eyespot reduces yields of winter wheat crops only when there is a high incidence of moderate or severe lesions of stems. In the case of strong attack where almost whole culm base was destroyed by fungus, the losses of yield to amount 30%, i.e. 0.843 t/ha.

AB  - The preferential development of giant mitochondria and their nuclei (nucleoids) in the egg cells of Pelargonium zonale Ait. during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis was examined by fluorescence microscopy, after Technovit embedding and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, fluorimetry for DNA content, using a video-intensified microscope photon-counting system (VIMPICS), and by three-dimensional reconstruction of mitochondrial nuclei (mt-nuclei). Reproductive cells during the megaspore mother cell, meiosis, tetrad, and functioning megaspore stages contained many small mitochondria with characteristic, uniformly DAPI-stained mt-nuclei about 0.3 mu m in diameter, containing a small amount of DNA (0.3 Mbp). During formation of the 2-, 4-, and 8-nucleate embryo sac, mt-nuclei did not markedly change in shape or DNA content. When the embryo sac formed and differentiation of each cell began, mitochondria and their nuclei in the egg cell took on a small ring or string-like shape. Accompanying the maturation of the embryo sac, they underwent progressive enlargement and gradually altered to long thick strings, or stacks of concentric or half concentric rings. By flower opening, they have developed to an extremely large size. One of these stacks of mt-nuclei was reconstructed in three dimensions; each ring in the stack was cup- or plate-shaped; 5 to 10 rings made up the stack, though each remained discontinuous from the others. From serial sections, we counted 44 mitochondria in one egg cell. Fluorometry using VIMPICS revealed that DNA amount within the stacked mitochondrion increased to 40 times that of the megaspore mother cell stage; a single stack of mitochondria contained 340-1700 Mbp DNA; which means that one egg cell contains at least 15000 Mbp mt-DNA, a value greater than the cell-nuclear DNA content.

TI  - EFFECT OF ANISOTROPY ON STRESSES IN ROTATING DISCS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - Stresses and deformations resulting from centrifugal forces in rotating specially orthotropic circular plates are determined. The classical laminated plate theory is employed in the analysis, and the results are presented in a manner which illustrates the effect of anisotropy. The plate is assumed to be rigidly fixed to a concentric rod allowing no deformation in its central region. The outer boundary is either free of any constraints or the plate is placed in a stiff casing which prevents radial deformation. A stiffness ratio, which is defined as the ratio of circumferential stiffness to radial stiffness, is used as the parameter to indicate the degree of anisotropy. Having a stiffness ratio greater than one eliminated the stress build-up on the boundaries. Higher stiffness ratios reduced the compressive stresses which began to occur near the outer boundary when the boundary was restrained from radial expansion, thus contributing to stability against local buckling. The results of Tsai-Wu failure analysis also showed that the choice of a stiffness ratio higher than one gives higher resistance against ply failure in tension.

AB  - This study examined acute systolic (SEP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure responses within passive and modified proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching techniques. Nonhypertensives (N = 60) were assigned to one of three treatment groups. Group I employed an antagonist passive stretch (APS), 6-sec maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the antagonist, and subsequent APS. Group 2 employed an APS, a 6-sec MVIC of the antagonist, submaximal concentric contraction of the agonist, and APS. Group 3 was similar to Group 2, with the deletion of an MVIC prior to the concentric contraction. Blood pressures were obtained during rest, baseline following passive stretch, and at the end of the three phases of the PNF technique. Range of motion (ROM) data were collected for baseline and treatment in terminal hip flexion for each group. All PNF treatments were effective for increasing ROM. One or two trials of PNF improve ROM and avoid increasing SEP, while a third trial increases SBP.

AB  - Intracardiac flow patterns during heart development were studied by injection of india ink into the yolk sac circulation of chick embryos at Hamburger-Hamilton stages 10 to 17. We injected india ink into a small venule or capillary, carefully preventing application of overpressure to the vascular system, and recorded the intracardiac route by video. From stage 12 onward, blood flow was laminar, and separate intracardiac currents were visualized. The yolk sac was divided into a left and a right half. Blood coursed through each half in concentric loops, ranging from the marginal sinus to the sinus venosus. This parallel array persisted within the heart. Bilateral to the embryo, two lateral regions arose that extended wedgelike within each half, resulting in six equally sized yolk sac regions at stage 16. The process of heart looping was not accompanied by a change in flow pattern. However, developmental changes of the yolk sac circulation were reflected in alteration of the intracardiac flow pattern. From stage 16 onward, the intracardiac flow pattern was no longer determined by the left- or right-hand side of the yolk sac but by bilateral anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the yolk sac. Blood from the lateral regions of the yolk sac was preferentially distributed to the head. The results show that in preseptation stages a relatively stable flow pattern is present. We suggest that alterations in blood flow could influence the process of normal heart development.

AB  - A simple method is presented to assess, on a regional scale, the contamination-risk of shallow aquifers covered by cracking clay soils, with special emphasis on preferential flow of contaminants through shrinkage cracks. A water extraction area of several hundred hectares is divided into units with homogeneous soil types and hydrological conditions. For each unit, a one-dimensional computer simulation model is used to compute residence times in the unsaturated zone of the cracking clay soils. Analytical equations are used to estimate residence times in the saturated zone. Finally, a classification system is proposed to summarize and visualize the model computations in a simple way. The developed method is illustrated with a case study from the Netherlands. It is known how contamination-risk maps of water extraction areas can be obtained. Policies to prevent contamination of the aquifer can be focused on the most vulnerable areas as indicated on such a map. The contamination-risk maps, obtained using the present method, deviate sharply from the traditional, more or less concentric protection zones, computed with saturated groundwater flow models.

AB  - Unstable dorsal fracture dislocations of the PIP joint of a finger commonly result in joint stiffness following immobilization or open reduction and internal fixation (Green and Rowland, 1984). The Agee dynamic external fixator, or force couple splint (Agee, 1978; 1987), was introduced in an attempt to avoid this complication and maintains a concentric reduction whilst allowing a full range of joint movement. The splint is constructed from three Kirschner wires and is activated by a single rubber band. A force couple is created across the proximal interphalangeal joint levering the base of the middle phalanx towards the palm whilst simultaneously lifting the distal end of the proximal phalanx dorsally to restore joint reduction. However, this technique is not without complications (Agee, 1987). We report a swan-neck deformity resulting from this treatment.

AB  - The approximately concentric arrangement of layered deposits and dune fields at the two Martian poles may reflect a nearly steady state dispersal of material from the polar deposits. Data on effective surface winds from high resolution Viking Images combined with theory of local winds suggest that the northern dunes are in part confined to a latitude band by winds generated by their own low albedo. Dispersal of the dark sand from the southern polar region is not subject to this kind of feedback because the irregular topography prevents areal accumulations sufficiently extensive to produce winds.

AB  - Eyespot colour patterns decorate the wings of many butterfly species. The eyespot is specified in the early pupal epidermis by signals from a central ''focus,'' and it has been suggested that the focus is the source of a diffusible morphogen gradient. We show that ectopic eyespots can be induced in nonfocal positions throughout the distal, but not the proximal, wing epidermis of Bicyclus anynana by mild epidermal damage inflicted at 12-18 hr (into a 6- to 7-day pupal period). Damage may lower, locally and transiently, the threshold for response to morphogen. Here, we have tested two predictions of the gradient model. As predicted, mild damage close to the focus (parafocal) locally extends the eyespot, making it markedly asymmetrical, even after early operations (1 or 6 hr), when remote epidermis is nonresponsive. Early parafocal operations also have an unexpected result, however, reducing the extent of the eyespot in other directions, perhaps through a long-range ''wound effect'' on the signaling activity of the focal cells. The model also correctly predicts that increasing the severity of a nonfocal operation will prolong the transient damage and hence give ectopic eyespots after early (1- or 6-hr) operations. We do not, however, find the expected size increase in ectopics induced by the later (12 or 18 hr) severe damage. Similarly, we demonstrate the predicted effect of early (1 or 6 hr) mild damage in increasing the response to a subsequent (18 hr) operation at the same position. The gradient model is therefore supported by most aspects of eyespot induction in response to epidermal damage. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

TI  - ISOKINETIC ECCENTRIC EXERCISE
T2  - SPORTS MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - The development of active isokinetic dynamometers has allowed the assessment of muscular moment under eccentric activations that have different characteristics to concentric actions. It is well documented that at a given angular velocity the eccentric moment is greater than the corresponding concentric moment. The moment-velocity relationship under eccentric conditions has been investigated, with conflicting results. Particularly, eccentric moment was reported to remain similar to, or to increase or decrease with, increasing angular velocity. As with concentric actions, the reliability of isokinetic eccentric measurements is influenced by a number of factors such as gravity, preload force and testing position.
   The velocity-specific effects of eccentric training have not been extensively investigated. Based on current knowledge, eccentric exercise does not appear to be velocity-specific. Although the mode specificity of both concentric and eccentric exercises have been investigated, the resultant observations are conflicting. Eccentric training has been found to improve both concentric and eccentric strength; yet, it has also been reported to improve only concentric or eccentric strength. The reciprocal muscle group ratios under eccentric actions were found not to be influenced by angular velocity, but the significant role of the eccentric/concentric moment ratio of each muscle has not been examined thoroughly. It is well documented that eccentric activations are associated with delayed muscle soreness and muscle damage. A limited number of studies have reported that isokinetic eccentric efforts may result in a lower amount of muscle soreness compared with other exercise modalities.
   Isokinetic dynamometers provide some unique characteristics for rehabilitation applications. Examination of the clinical application of eccentric exercise is limited. Consequently, the use of this exercise modality in prevention and assessment of musculoskeletal injuries should be investigated further.

AB  - 1. Two leaf-mining moths in the genus Phyllonorycter colonized Great Britain in the mid-1980s, both feeding on introduced garden and amenity plants: P. leucographelln on Pyracantha spp., and P. platani on Platanus spp.
   2. Systematic surveys of the distribution and spread of the two species were carried out spanning a period of 5 and 3 years. The effect of humans in dispersing the two moths was also studied.
   3. The relationship between the square root of the range and time was in both cases remarkably linear, suggesting that the spread of the moths can be viewed as a simple travelling wave. The velocity of this wave was 10.3 km year(-1) for P. leucographella and 8.6 km year(-1) for P. platani.
   4. There were slight deviations from the predicted pattern of spread as a series of concentric circles. For P. leucographella these are partially explained by variations in urbanization, which is correlated with the density of host plants.
   5. Several foci of colonization outside the main range were detected, due to human activities. There was also evidence of artificial spread in the vicinity of the main advance, but this was not sufficient to obscure the simple pattern detected.

AB  - The compression of an elastic circular cylinder under a uniform load is considered when radial expansion is prevented over a central portion of the curved surface by a rigid constraint concentric with the cylinder. From the mixed boundary conditions on the outer surface, dual series equations are obtained which are subsequently reduced to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind amenable to numerical solution. An alternative derivation of this integral is also presented. The numerical solution of this integral equation is obtained, and the physical quantities of interest are calculated.

AB  - A novel use of selection was applied to the examination of the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. The approach provides a sensitive way of detecting genotype-environment (g x e) interactions and also allows the form of any interactions across an environmental gradient to be investigated through changes in the shapes of the reaction norms. The wing pattern of the butterfly B, anynana varies with season; eyespot size increases with development temperature. Selection lines to increase and to decrease eyespot size at 28 degrees C were carried out. The effect of selection on the eyespot reaction norms with temperature was examined. Selection produced divergent reaction norms across the entire range of temperature in most eyespots. Significant g x e interactions were sometimes present but the degree of interaction was always relatively small. When present, the form of the interaction varied between the sexes. There was a high degree of genetic independence between the eyespots on the ventral and on the dorsal wing surfaces, except in the dorsal eyespot in the wing cell corresponding to the wing cell of the selected ventral wing surface eyespot. The significance of the results for the maintenance of genetic variation in B, anynana is considered.

AB  - Black pigment extracted from wings of Precis coenia was identified as melanin by solubility characteristics and incorporation of radiolabeled melanin precursors. Different colours in wing scales appeared successively, starting with white followed by red, black and grey pigments. At corresponding times [C-14]-tyrosine and [C-14]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine injected into pupae were incorporated most intensively into black and grey scales. By contrast, red scales were labeled by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and, to a lesser extent, by tyrosine when injected at the time of red pigment synthesis. Labeled beta-alanine, a component of the sclerotizing agent N-beta-alanyldopamine, was incorporated into all scales with the exception of intensely black scales. It is discussed whether the mechanical stability of black scales may be due to melanin itself whereas the stability of all other scales may be due to N-beta-alanyldopamine.
   Amounts of extractable melanin increased during visible pigment formation in black and grey scales. When [C-14]-tyrosine was offered to isolated wings in Grace's medium before melanization, 93% of incorporated activity was found in the hydrolysable fraction and only 7% in the melanin fraction. However, when supplied during intensive melanin synthesis up to 70% was incorporated into melanin. The same incorporation pattern resulted after injection into intact developing pupae. Incorporation of [C-14]-tyrosine into melanin began earlier, and was higher in presumptive black scales than in grey scales. Incorporation into white scales was always low, DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) activity in whole wings was low during the pupal stage but increased at the time when scale melanization started. DDC activity in different coloured wing pieces increased first in presumptive black pattern elements, the eyespots, DDC activity in the eyespots was 3.5 times higher than in presumptive white parts of the wing; it was intermediate in grey areas. This demonstrates that wing colour pattern as well as colouration intensity are related to selective activity of DDC in time and different locations resulting in different amounts of melanin in grey and black scales.

AB  - Two new species of Isospora are reported in the faecal contents of the barred woodcreeper, Dendrocolaptes certhia from Ecuador. Oocysts of Isospora magna sp. n. are reported from 1/4 barred woodcreepers. Sporulated oocysts are ovoidal, 29.7 x 24.9 (26-31 x 23-26) mu m, with a smooth, colorless, bilayered wall; average shape index is 1.20. No micropyle or oocyst residuum are present, but the oocyst contains 1 large, rough polar granule. Sporocysts are ovoidal, 15.8 x 12.6 (15-20 x 11-14) mu m; average shape index is 1.28 with a smooth, single layered wall. The Stieda body is broad dome-like and the substieda body is inconspicuous, with a wavy lower surface and located directly below and slightly to the side of the sporocyst vertical axis. Each sporocyst contains a residuum of fine, uniform granules in a consolidated, lobate cluster. Sporozoites are sausage-shaped with an ovoid, posterior, refractile body, a slightly smaller anterior, refractile body; nucleus is spherical, less distinct and centrally located. Isospora concentrica sp. n. is reported from 3/6 barred woodcreepers. Sporulated oocysts are ovoidal, 26.6 x 22.7 (24-30 x 21-25) mu m, colorless, with a smooth bilayered wall; shape index is 1.2. No micropyle or oocyst residuum are present, but the oocyst contains a single, ovoid polar body or occasionally 2 polar bodies. Sporocysts are ovoidal to ellipsoidal, 17.2 x 11 (15-18 x 9-12) mu m, with a squared or block-shaped Stieda body and an ovoidal or bubble-shaped substieda body located beneath the Stieda body, usually to the left or right of the sporocyst vertical axis; shape index is 1.6. Sporocyst residuum is compact, usually slightly ovoid and composed of uniform, fine granules. Sporozoites are vermiform and appear randomly arranged in the sporocysts with a round posterior refractile body, a large circular nucleus and the anterior part marked with concentric lines.

KW  - ALGAE
AB  - Using anti-rhodopsin antibody, an immunofluorescence method was established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in order to locate rhodopsin in the cell. The method showed that rhodopsin is located in the membrane near (or around) the pigmented eyespot in green algae. In synchronized cells, the location of rhodopsin changes regularly during the cell cycle. The fluorescence (F) spot moves from the anterior region toward the posterior region of the chloroplast (cp) in the light period. Following cell division, the F spots reappear in each daughter cell whether the daughter cells are released from the mother cell wall or not. The F spot is located opposite the site of the last cleavage furrow whether the cell has divided once, twice, or three times. The F spot moves back toward the anterior region from the equatorial plane after division in the dark period. In white algae eyespot-deficient mutants, rhodopsin does not depend on the presence of the eyespot. The results further showed that rhodopsin resides in the plasmalemma. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - A new sand-dwelling dinoflagellate, Gymnosodium quadrilobatum sp. nov., is described from the south coast of Natal, South Africa. The organism contains 20-30 chloroplasts, which are peripherally arranged, and a conspicuous eyespot. The motile cell is directly transformed into a non-motile cell and cell division is restricted to the non-motile phase. The motile cell has a typical gymnodinioid organisation, while the non-motile cell possesses a thick cell wall and develops the characteristic cell shape, which is reminiscent of a four-leaved clover. The chloroplasts of G. quadrilobatum belong to an endosymbiotic alga the cytoplasm of which is separated from the host (dinoflagellate) cytoplasm by a single unit membrane. Other organelles contained in the endosymbiont cytoplasm are the nucleus, ribosomes and mitochondria. The endosymbiont is thought to be a chromophyte alga. The eyespot is bounded by a triple membrane and is situated in the host cytoplasm. On the basis of the similarities in the ultrastructure of G. quadrilobatum with those of four thecate dinoflagellates, viz. Peridinium balticum, P. foliaceum, P. quinquecorne and Peridinium sp., which are known to possess a similar endosymbiont, possible phylogenetic affinities between G. quadrilobatum and four thecate dinoflagellates are discussed.

TI  - COMMINUTED FRACTURES OF THE POSTERIOR WALL OF THE ACETABULUM - A BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION OF FIXATION METHODS
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
LA  - English
KW  - STABILITY
AB  - Reproducible simple fractures and osteotomies of the posterior wall of the acetabulum were created in twenty paired hemipelves from fresh human cadavera. Comminution was created with an additional fracture line that was either parallel (concentric comminution) or perpendicular (transverse comminution) to the posterior rim of the acetabulum. Under simulated weight-bearing, the stiffness of fixation of the transversely comminuted fractures that had been achieved with use of a reconstruction plate and screws was significantly higher than that achieved with fixation with screws alone (p < 0.05). The load to failure of the fixation of transversely comminuted fractures treated with a reconstruction plate and screws was also significantly higher than that of fixation of such fractures with screws alone (p = 0.05). The load to failure of the fixation of concentrically comminuted fractures was significantly higher when a reconstruction plate and accessory spring plates had been used than when a reconstruction plate alone had been employed (p < 0.05).
   CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Secure fixation of fractures of the posterior wall of the acetabulum is critical since loss of fixation results in chronic instability and limited options for reconstruction. The data from the present study support our clinical observations that, for transversely comminuted fractures, fixation with a buttress plate is stronger than fixation with screws alone and that supplementary fixation with spring plates mag help to prevent redisplacement of concentrically comminuted fractures of the posterior wall of the acetabulum.

AB  - We have studied interactions between developmental processes and genetic variation for the eyespot color pattern on the adult dorsal forewing of the nymphalid butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. Truncation selection was applied in both an upward and a downward direction to the size of a single eyespot consisting of rings with wing scales of differing color pigments. High heritabilities resulted in rapid responses to selection yielding divergent lines with very large or very small eyespots. Strong correlated responses occurred in most of the other eyespots on each wing surface. The cells at the center of a presumptive eyespot (the ''focus'') act in the early pupal stage to establish the adult wing pattern. The developmental fate of the scale cells within an eyespot is specified by the ''signaling'' properties of the focus and the ''response'' thresholds of the epidermis. The individual eyespots can be envisaged as developmental homologues. Grafting experiments performed with the eyespot foci of the selected lines showed that additive genetic variance exists for both the response and, in particular, the signaling components of the developmental system. The results are discussed in the context of how constraints on the evolution of this wing pattern may be related to the developmental organization.

AB  - A comparative study of fertile sporophytes has been carried out on seven dictyotalean species from Australia. Patterns of sporangial distribution and development are similar in Zonaria angustata, Zonaria diesingiana, Zonaria spiralis, Zonaria turneriana and Lobophora variegata but they differ in Homoeostrichus olsenii and Homoeostrichus sinclairii. In Zonaria and Lobophora, sporangia occur in indusiate sori, are embedded in a mucilaginous matrix and, in Z diesingiana, Z. spiralis and Z turneriana, are surrounded by whitish paraphyses. In contrast to Zonaria, the indusiate sporangial sori of H. olsenii form adjacent to concentric rows of brown paraphyses but they lack both mucilage and paraphyses. Sporangia of H. sinclarii occur among dense brown paraphyses which cover the terminal thallus segments. Sporogenesis in species of Zonaria and Lobophora differs conspicuously from other Dictyotalean genera in that nuclear divisions occur when the developing sporangium is quite small, a sporangial stalk cell is not formed and eight spores are released. Sporangial development in H. olsenii, H. sinclarii and in many other genera of the Dictyotales is characterised by the formation of one to three sporangial stalk cells (except in H. sinclairii which forms a multicellular sporangial stalk) and the occurrence of a nuclear division in the mature sporangium to produce four spores. In the mature sporangia of Zonaria, Lobophora and Homoeostrichus, physodes concentrate along the plane of cytokinesis, appear to be involved in the cleavage of the spore protoplasts and, in Zonaria and Lobophora only, their contents are excreted from sporangia during cytokinesis. New characters (presence of sporangial stalk cell mucilage in the sporangial sorus and differing patterns of sporogenesis) provide futher supporting evidence for the recognition of Zonaria and Homoeostrichus as separate genera.

AB  - The effects of panicle compactness and host plant resistance on the rate of population increase of sorghum midge (Contarinia sorghicola Coq.), head bugs (Calocoris angustatus Leth.) and head caterpillar (Helicoverpa armigera Hb.) in large concentric plots over three sequential sowings during the 1985-86 rainy seasons were studied.  Early-planted crops suffered less damage than the late-planted crops.  H. armigera damage was negligible in genotypes with loose panicles.  Calocoris angustatus population increase was lower in genotypes with loose panicles.  Panicle compactness did not affect the damage caused by C. sorghicola and Campylomma spp.  Host plant resistance had a marked effect on the rate of population increase across sowing dates in the case of sorghum midge and head bugs.  Thus, cultivars with resistance to insects and/or with loose panicles can help to reduce the losses caused by panicle-feeding insects in sorghum.

AB  - We have recovered a unique refractory spherule, B6, from the Murchison C2 chondrite. Approximately 170 mum in diameter, it is concentrically zoned, with an outer rim sequence, from outermost to innermost, of aluminous diopside (10 mum thick), anorthite (3 mum), and melilite (3 mum). Inside the melilite layer is a 7 mum-thick, nearly pure layer of spinel. Inward from this layer is a 20-mum wide zone of hibonite laths enclosed in spinel. Inward from this zone, at the core of the inclusion, is CaAl4O7 + perovskite. This is the first reported occurrence of CaAl4O7 in a Murchison inclusion. The sequence of mineral assemblages from the spinel shell inward parallels that expected for crystallization of a melt with the composition of this spherule: 73.2 wt% Al2O3; 17.7% MgO; 6.5% CaO; and 2.5% TiO2. From the bulk composition of the inclusion, distribution of phases, and spherical shape, we conclude that the oxide phases in it, including spinel, crystallized from a liquid. From calculated phase relations in the system Al2O3-MgO-CaO, we infer a melting temperature of approximately 2100-degrees-C, the highest ever inferred for a refractory inclusion. Evidence of a high-temperature history is also seen in the spinel, which, unlike that in most CAIs, contains 1-2 mol% excess Al2O3 relative to stoichiometric MgAl2O4. At this temperature, B6 should have been grossly out of equilibrium (by approximately 600-degrees-C) with a gas of solar composition at 10(-3) atm, but no evidence of evaporative loss is seen. The inclusion has a Group II REE pattern and a normal magnesium isotopic composition. The latter observation requires a very brief cooling time, on the order of several seconds. This is consistent with cooling rates calculated for a liquid spherule of the size and composition of B6 undergoing radiative cooling in the solar nebula and constrains the heating mechanism to a small-scale event. We propose the following sequence for the formation of B6: condensation of solid precursors; melting of those precursors in a hypervelocity collision which caused heating of the melt to approximately 2100-degrees-C; rapid formation of the spinel shell, preventing evaporation of the melt; fractional crystallization of the melt; and addition, probably by condensation, of the silicate layers. Corundum and CaAl4O7 are very rarely found in Murchison CAIs. Apparently, most early formed, corundum-rich condensates continued to react with the solar nebula until hibonite, perovskite, and spinel had condensed, forming aggregates which, when melted, gave rise to liquids too rich in TiO2, MgO, and CaO to yield corundum or CaAl4O7 upon cooling.

AB  - 1. While collecting nectar in hovering flight the European hawk moth Macroglossum stellatarum efficiently regulates its distance relative to flowers that are shaken by wind. This can be demonstrated in laboratory experiments by moving dummy flowers (blue cardboard disks) towards and away from the feeding animal (Fig. 1). 2. Distance regulation is predominantly mediated by visual cues. Mechanoreceptors on the proboscis appear to contribute little to the response. 3. Movements of dummy flowers can be simulated by expanding and contracting a pattern projected onto a screen. With this technique we investigated the dynamical properties of the servo mechanism underlying distance regulation. The system behaves as a bandpass filter with corner frequencies of 0.15 and 5 Hz (Figs.2,3). 4. When a high-speed ramp-like movement of the flower is simulated, there is an asymmetry in the response. During simulated approach the reaction is phasic-tonic with a pronounced overshoot at the beginning, during simulated retraction it remains tonic (Fig.5B,C). 5. During distance regulation the animals compensate for the speed of the edge of the projected pattern. Distance regulation improves substantially when the number of stimulated elementary movement detectors is increased through increasing the number of contour lines by projecting concentric rings instead of a homogeneous disk (Figs.7, 8).

AB  - Stirring Devices in Screw Metering Equipment - Action and Design Strategy. The accurarcy of metering by screw dosage equipment with or without gravimetric control depends primarily on the flow of material to the discharging screw. In the case of cohesive solids, stirring devices are generally required to prevent bridging. Experimental observations show that flow conditions correlate directly with the intensity of stirring. Mass flow in the metering container and hence optimum constancy of metering are attainable only from certain stirring efficiencies upwards. Cases of interference to metering due to poor flow of solids can be explained and overcome by modified dimensioning. The effects of the principal parameters - geometry and speed of rotation of the stirrer - are studied with the aid of two stirrer configurations - viz. overhead and concentric. Straightforward model calculations provide a mathematical method of estimation for optimum and reliable stirrer dimensioning also applicable to strongly cohesive solids.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate with the new dynamo ergometer the forces produced within a defined range of motion at a constant velocity during concentric translatoric work as well as to investigate fatigue based on neuromuscular and metabolic parameters. We examined 11 male sports students with the ''Motomir'' device with the subjects in a sitting position. The test consisted of four times 1 min of concentric leg work with 1-min rest phases in between. The subjects were asked to do maximum effort push movements with one leg and maximum effort pull movements with the other leg. The translatoric form of movement did not reveal any significant differences in strength between the left and right legs. The strength of the extensors was significantly higher than that of the flexors during all exercise stages (p < 0.001). A significant decrease in strength was established for extensor muscles and no significant decrease for the flexor muscles. The quotient of flexor/extensor was 0.431+/-0.07 in the first exercise stage and increased in every stage till the fourth. There was a correlation (p < 0.001) between the difference in lactate of the first and fourth exercise stages and the percentage of force decrease from the 1st to the 4th min. The electric activity of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius muscles decreased from the first to the fourth exercise stage. This decrease was however not significant. The translatoric constant velocity dynamo ergometer allows both diagnosis and training at varying angles and varying speeds while avoiding unphysiological maximum loads. In contrast to conventional isokinetic dynamometers a translatoric work promotes the rolling movement in the knee and provides new aspects for rehabilitation.

AB  - Based on the physiological principles of the muscular force-velocity concept, this paper deals with the special problems associated with determining and interpreting force-velocity relations of muscles in situ particularly in humans. In the strict sense, instead of force-velocity relations merely torque-angular velocity relations of a joint can be measured directly under in situ conditions. This calls for biomechanical model calculations to obtain force-velocity relations of single muscles involved in joint motions. In addition to discussing these basic principles, the methodological problems arising in measurements with so-called isokinetic dynamometers are also explicitly described. An important message of this paper is to sensitize potential users of this method to these problems as the isokinetic dynamometry has more or less become standard procedure worldwide. The possibility of the characterization of muscle fiber composition and the evaluation of power on the basis of human muscle force-velocity relations is also discussed. A final section considers the effects of muscle training on the torque-angular velocity relations. The contents of this paper can be understood as a guide to avoid obtaining conflicting results when measuring human torque-velocity relations.

AB  - A modified Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer was used to evaluate the problems associated with measuring the concentric force-velocity characteristics of human knee extensor muscles. Three contraction protocols were investigated, simple voluntary contractions (VC); releases from maximal voluntary isometric contractions (VR) and releases from isometric femoral nerve stimulated contractions (FNR). Percutaneous stimulation of the quadriceps was unsuitable for dynamic contractions as the proportion of the muscle activated varied with the angle of knee flexion. Isometric length-tension relationships and isokinetic contractions at seven angular velocities between 0.5 and 5.2 rad s(-1) were recorded in five subjects. During isometric and slow dynamic contractions the voluntary forces were often greater than those obtained by femoral nerve stimulation, probably due to subjects stretching the rectus femoris during voluntary manoeuvres. It was found that the VC protocol produced acceptable isokinetic force recordings only at velocities below 3.1 rad s(-1) in most subjects whilst VR contractions resulted in unexpectedly low forces at velocities below 1.57 rad s(-1). Of the three techniques employed, FNR, although uncomfortable for subjects, provided the most accurate and reliable method of measuring force-velocity characteristics of knee extensor muscles. FNR contractions produced a force-velocity curve which showed a smooth decline in force with increasing velocity up to 5.2 rad s(-1). VC contractions appear to be an acceptable alternative for testing the muscles provided the angular velocity is less than 3.1 rad s(-1) and the subjects can be prevented from stretching the rectus femoris during the movement.

AB  - Developmental processes exert their influence on the evolution of complex morphologies through the genetic correlations they engender between traits. Butterfly wing color patterns provide a model system to examine this connection between development and evolution. In butterflies, the nymphalid groundplan is a framework used to decompose complex wing patterns into their component pattern elements. The first goal of this work has been to determine whether the components of the nymphalid groundplan are the products of independent developmental processes. To test this hypothesis, the genetic correlation matrices for two species of butterflies, Precis coenia and Precis evarete, were estimated for 27 wing pattern characters. The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that the differentiation of serial homologs lowers their genetic correlations. The ''eyespots'' found serially repeated across the fore- and hindwing and on the dorsal and ventral wing surfaces provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis. The genetic correlation matrices of both species were very similar. The pattern of genetic correlation measured between the different types of pattern elements and between the homologous repeats of a pattern element supported the first hypothesis of developmental independence among the elements of the groundplan. The correlation pattern among the differentiated serial homologs was similarly found to support the second hypothesis: pairs of eyespots that had differentiated had lower genetic correlations than pairs that were similar in morphology. The implications of this study are twofold: First, the apparent developmental independence among the distinct elements of wing pattern has facilitated the vast diversification in morphology found in butterflies. Second, the lower genetic correlations between differentiated homologs demonstrates that developmental constraints can in fact be broken. The extent to which genetic correlations readily change, however, remains unknown. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Contraction-induced injury results in the degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers of the three types of contractions-shortening (concentric), isometric, and lengthening (eccentric)-injury is most likely to occur and the severity of the injury is greatest during lengthening contractions The magnitude of the injury to muscle fibers may be assessed by direct measures of cellular and ultrastructural damage, by indirect measures of changes in enzyme efflux, calcium influx, ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione, and force development, and, in human beings, by reports of muscle soreness The sequence of events includes an initial injury that is primarily mechanical and a secondary metabolic, or biochemical, injury that peaks 1 to 3 days after the injurious contractions. The recovery from contraction-induced injury is usually complete within 30 days Repeated exposures to protocols of lengthening contractions result in ''trained'' muscles that are not injured by the protocol that previously caused injury.

AB  - Objective and design: In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) arterial vasodilators do not cause regression and might cause further progression of cardiac hypertrophy. To assess whether these effects extend to the vasculature, and to examine the possible mechanisms involved, cardiac and mesenteric arterial structure was evaluated with respect to changes in cardiac volume load and cardiac and arterial sympathetic activity during long-term (5- and 10-week) treatment of 16-week-old SHR with the arterial vasodilator minoxidil, alone or in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide.
   Results: Despite causing a persistent decrease in blood pressure in SHR, minoxidil further increased left and right ventricular weights and left ventricular internal diameter. In combination with hydrochlorothiazide, minoxidil caused concentric, rather than eccentric, left ventricular hypertrophy. In the mesenteric arterial bed of SHR, minoxidil increased the lumen of the superior mesenteric artery, and prevented further increases in the medial area of the large and small mesenteric arteries. The increase in lumen size of the superior mesenteric artery by minoxidil was abolished when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the treatment. After 10 weeks' treatment with minoxidil, noradrenaline turnover rates were still significantly increased in the left ventricle but were decreased in the mesenteric arteries in the SHR. Minoxidil increased plasma and blood volumes, the increases being largely prevented by concomitant diuretic treatment.
   Conclusions: We conclude that there are regional differences in the response of the cardiovascular system to minoxidil in SHR. Some of these differences may be related to differences in regional sympathetic activity, whereas volume load appears to play a modulatory role.

AB  - The three point method (TPM) has been successfully applied to several seismic series and has provided information about the spatial characteristics (azimuth and dip) of the fault planes activated in the rupture process. A new development of the TPM to determine temporal characteristics, is presented, to obtain the evolution of the fracturing process of an active fault system. For the analysis of the 158 microearthquakes and earthquakes that took place in the seismic series of Antequera ih June 1989, the choice of a threshold magnitude (m(u) = 2.5) has permitted the events related to the most relevant fractures to be distinguished. Secondly, only the events between two concentric spheres (here named Spatial Crown) with respect to a given earthquake, have been used in order to avoid taking into account earthquakes that are too close to each other, together with the very distant events that have little relation to the event analysed. The Spatial Crown has permitted some clear results in the Antequera series, where we have found that the fracturing process began fundamentally with N 80 degrees E planes and evolved to N 65 degrees W planes. Finally, an error analysis enables an estimation of the uncertainty in the results to be obtained from the errors in the data.

AB  - Bacteria isolated from wheat seedlings, plants or straw from several field sites were screened for antagonism towards the cereal eyespot pathogen Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides on several media of differing nutrient status. Thirteen out of 348 isolates inhibited pathogen growth on low-nutrient media and several also prevented spore germination or reduced germ tube extension. These were selected for further tests on wheat seedlings inoculated with the eyespot fungus. Twelve known bacterial antagonists of other fungal plant pathogens were tested in vitro using the same methods, and the majority showed some activity towards P. herpotrichoides. Selected isolates were equally inhibitory to both W and R pathotypes of the fungus. Effects of potential antagonists on disease development were assessed by scoring lesions or by counting the number of infection plaques formed by the fungus on leaf sheaths. Two isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens, along with a commercial strain of Streptomyces griseoviridis, showed activity both in vitro and in subsequent infection trials with plants and may therefore be of potential value as antagonists of P. herpotrichoides.

AB  - Ontogenetic changes in the vertical distribution of a cohort of juvenile bay scallops, Argopecten irradians, on eelgrass, Zostera marina, were followed throughout the summer and early fall in two Long Island embayments (New York, USA). Despite site-specific differences in eelgrass height and density, more than 95% of post-settlement scallops remained attached above the bottom until they reached a shell height of about 11 mm. Over a 5-week period, scallops gradually relocated until, at a mean size of 31 mm, all occurred on the bottom. The decline in percent attachment coincided with a 5-fold increase (from 16 to 84 mumoles min-1 g muscle dry wt-1) in the activity of octopine dehydrogenase (proposed here as an index of the scallops' capacity for burst swimming activity), and in maximum rate of increase in the shell aspect ratio. While attached to eelgrass, scallops were nonuniformly distributed, with greatest concentration at mid-canopy. Following disturbance, they rapidly regained above-ground position, attaining asymptotic heights within 3-10 h. This and prior studies suggest that the climbing behavior of the bay scallop is an adaptive response to high predation pressure at small sizes. Enhanced scope for activity (predator avoidance) may enhance survival of scallops at intermediate sizes, when they become too heavy to maintain elevation but have not yet attained effective refuge in size.

AB  - Objective. The authors report the use of multiple implanted intraspinal port and catheter systems per test animal to study the in vivo functional characteristics and reliability of a new implantable spinal drug delivery port system. Methods. Four ewes were each implanted with two epidural and one subarachnoid silicone elastomer catheters at the lumbar level. Each catheter was connected in series to one of three Therex filtered spinal delivery ports implanted subcutaneously in a similar grid pattern in each ewe to facilitate percutaneous identification. Saline (2 ml) was injected 3 times weekly in each port. The ease of injection and behavioral responses were recorded for 207-213 days of implantation until sacrifice/necropsy. Results. All ports functioned reliably during the study. However, injection through two of the four subarachnoid catheters resulted in behavioral withdrawal responses intermittently. This behavioral pattern was much less common after epidural port injections. All four subarachnoid and four of eight epidural port and catheter systems were tested with local anesthetic just before sacrifice. Motor block was observed in three of four subarachnoid and three of four epidural port and catheter systems tested. Integrity of the other four epidural ports was tested by injection of methylene blue at sacrifice. This dye did not distribute in the epidural space in one of the latter four epidural ports (not local anesthetic tested) because of a concentric fibrotic reaction about the catheter. Similar fibrotic reactions surrounded the catheters that failed a functional test with local anesthetic. Conclusions. The implantable intraspinal port system tested functions reliably under repetitive percutaneous access. However, filtering such ports, though desirable to prevent entry of debris into the spinal canal, did not eliminate pericatheter chronic subarachnoid and epidural reaction. The number of test animals required to test 12 ports chronically was reduced by two-thirds without undue trauma to the individual test subject. Chronic percutaneous injection of an implanted subarachnoid system is feasible but may be associated with behavioral effects similar to that seen with chronic epidural systems. Fibrosis around chronic silicone catheters limited functional utility in one-fourth of the implanted test systems. Further study of the potential reactivity of chronic epidural and subarachnoid catheters is indicated.

AB  - Recent observations have suggested that the patterns of expression of the gap junction protein connexin43 in the developing cardiovascular system of the avian embryo diverge significantly from the patterns previously seen in mammalian species. Therefore, a detailed analysis of connexin43 expression in the chicken embryo was performed by use of immunofluorescent localization with two different connexin43-specific antipeptide antibodies as well as Western and Northern blot analysis. Connexin43 protein was not detected in the avian myocardium, the venous system, or the smaller vessels of the arterial system. Rather, it was limited exclusively to the vessels of the arterial outflow tract in a concentric pattern that became evident by embryonic day 8. Double staining with anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin and connexin43 demonstrated colocalization in the media of outflow tract vessel walls. The developmental expression of connexin43 was found to mirror the spatial patterning of secondary actin; connexin43, however, preceded the expression of secondary actin by a period of 1-2 days. In contrast, antibodies to a related gap junction protein (connexin42) revealed an absence of immunostaining in the avian outflow tract. Double staining with anti-connexin42 and anti-A-cell adhesion molecule (specific for avian intercalated discs) demonstrated colocalization between cardiac myocytes, indicating that connexin42 is a constituent of avian myocardial gap junctions. In light of these findings, developmental expression of differing myocardial connexins may reconcile previous studies showing different physiological properties of avian and mammalian cardiac gap junctions.

AB  - To compare efficacy of point count sampling in bottomland hardwood forests, duration of point count, number of point counts, number of visits to each point during a breeding season, and minimum sample size were examined. Minimum sample sizes were computed from the variation recorded during 82 point counts from 3 selected localities containing 3 habitat types (wet, mesic, and dry) across 3 regions of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (northern, central, and southern). For each of these point counts, all birds seen or heard during the initial 3 minutes and during each minute thereafter up to 10 minutes within three concentric distance categories (<25 m, 25 to 50 m, and >50 m) were recorded. In a second study, the effect of increasing the number of points or visits was determined by comparing the results of 150 4-minute point counts obtained from each of four stands on Delta Experimental Forest. Within each stand, bootstrap estimates of the mean cumulative number of species each year were obtained from all possible combinations of six points and six visits. Similar analyses of 384 counts obtained from 132 points distributed among 56 sites in west Tennessee bottomland forests were undertaken. Mean number of species recorded during 5- and 10-minute counts were 10.3 and 12.9 and 11.3 and 14.7 for the lower MAV and west Tennessee, respectively. There was significant variation in numbers of birds and species between regions and localities nested within regions; neither habitat nor the interaction between region and habitat was significant. Sample size sufficient to detect actual differences of some species (e.g., wood thrush [Hylocichla mustelina]) was >500; for other species (e.g., prothonotary warbler [Protonotaria citrea]), this same level of precision could be achieved with <10 counts. Significant differences in mean cumulative species were detected among the number of points visited and among the number of visits to a point. Although no interaction was detected between number of points and number of visits, when paired reciprocals were compared, more points invariably yielded significantly greater cumulative number of species than more visits to a point in the lower MAV. In west Tennessee, more points yielded either similar or significantly more cumulative species than more visits.

AB  - The component parts of butterfly wing patterns are arranged in sets of serially homologous pattern elements, repeated from wing cell to wing cell. Measurements were made on the sizes and positions of these elements on two successive, independent, sets of specimens in order to elucidate the phenotypic correlation structure among pattern elements. That portion of the correlation between measures due to overall size variation was accounted for through two alternate methods: multiple regression on two vein length measures, which represent wing size, and a Wright-style factor analysis. The sizes of pattern elements belonging to a homologous series were found to be significantly correlated whereas those of non-homologous elements varied independently. The degree of correlation among homologs varied, and, in the case of eyespot sizes, appeared to be inversely related to the degree of their morphological divergence. Although not correlated in size, the positions of non-homologous elements that lie within the same wing cell are moderately correlated. The results support current developmental models for the ontogeny of butterfly color pattern.

AB  - A new multistage Hough transform approach to the problem of ellipse detection in images is presented. The proposed approach is based on the polar and pole definition of conics and its advantage lies in avoiding the propagation of parameter estimation error over the successive stages of the Hough transform. The proposed method is capable of detecting partially visible ellipses, overlapping ellipses, and groups of concentric ellipses. A set of experimental results is presented to demonstrate these capabilities of the suggested approach.

AB  - Using fluorescent probes and confocal laser scanning microscopy we have examined the organisation of the microtubule and actin components of the cytoskeleton in kidney-shaped guard cells of six species of Selaginella. The stomata of Selaginella exhibit novel cytoskeletal arrangements, and at different developmental stages, display similarities in microtubule organisation to the two major types of stomata: grass (dumbbell-shaped) and non-grass (kidney-shaped). Initially, cortical microtubules and F-actin radiate from the stomatal pore and extend across the external and internal periclinal cell surfaces of the guard cells. As the stomata differentiate, the cytoskeleton reorients only along the internal periclinal walls. Reorganisation is synchronous in guard cells of the same stoma. Microtubules on the inner periclinal walls of the guard cells now emanate from areas of the ventral wall on either side of the pore and form concentric circles around the pore. The rearrangement of F-actin is similar to that of microtubules although F-actin is less well organised. Radial arrays of both microtubules and F-actin are maintained adjacent to the external surfaces. Subsequently, in two of the six species of Selaginella examined, microtubules on both the internal and external walls become oriented longitudinally and exhibit no association with the ventral wall. In the other four species, microtubules adjacent to the internal walls revert to the initial radial alignment. These findings may have implications in the development and evolution of the stomatal complex.

AB  - Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to: 1) prophylactic ibuprofen (N = 5) [400 mg TID initiated 4 h before collection of baseline data and strenuous eccentric exercise bout], 2) therapeutic ibuprofen (N = 5) [400 mg TID initiated 24 h after baseline], 3) placebo (N = 5), or 4) control (N = 5). Muscle soreness perception, plasma creatine kinase, knee extensor torque, and EMG of the quadriceps were evaluated at baseline, 24, and 48 h. The prophylactic ibuprofen group had between 40 and 50% less muscle soreness perception and significantly less decline in isometric, concentric, and eccentric torque at 24 h compared with the other three groups (P < 0.05). At 48 h both prophylactic and therapeutic ibuprofen had significantly less muscle soreness perception and decline in torque than the placebo and control groups (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the amount of muscle damage between the four groups at 24 and 48 h. Vastus medialis and lateralis EMG magnitude decreased across time. Vastus lateralis EMG magnitude had significantly less decline from baseline for prophylactic ibuprofen compared with the other three treatments at 24 h, while both prophylactic and therapeutic ibuprofen had significantly less decline at 48 h. These data indicate that a prophylactic dosage of ibuprofen does not prevent CK release from muscle, but does decrease muscle soreness perception and may assist in restoring muscle function.

AB  - We have studied the effect of exhaustive concentric physical exercise on glutathione redox status and the possible relationship between blood glutathione oxidation and blood lactate and pyruvate levels. Levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in blood increase after exhaustive concentric physical exercise in trained humans. GSSG levels were 72% higher immediately after exercise than at rest. They returned to normal values 1 h after exercise. Blood reduced glutathione (GSH) levels did not change significantly after the exercise. We have found a linear relationship between GSSG-to-GSH and lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in human blood before, during, and after exhaustive exercise. In rats, physical exercise also caused an increase in blood GSSG levels that were 200% higher after physical exercise than at rest. GSH levels did not change significantly. Thus, both in rats and humans, exhaustive physical exercise causes a change in glutathione redox status in blood. We have also found that antioxidant administration, i.e., oral vitamin C, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, or glutathione, is effective in preventing oxidation of the blood glutathione pool after physical exercise in rats.

AB  - We have studied the development of the eyespot colour pattern on the adult dorsal forewing of the nymphalid butterflies, Bicyclus safitza and B. anynana, by cauterising the presumptive eyespot centres (the foci) on the pupal wing. The effects on pattern depended on age at cautery. Earl focal cautery (at 1-12 hours after pupation) usually reduced or eliminated the eyespot, while cautery at a non-focal site usually had no effect. These results resemble those of a previous study on another species but, in addition, we find that a later cautery (at 12-24 hours) had the converse effect of generating pattern, so that focal cautery enlarged the anterior eyespot (but usually not the large posterior eyespot) and nonfocal cautery induced a new ectopic eyespot.
   The effects of cautery on patterning are more extensive by an order of magnitude than the cell death which is caused, so implicating a long-range mechanism, such as a morphogen gradient, in eyespot development. The focus clearly acts to establish the normal eyespot pattern, but a simple source/diffusion model is not supported by the response to late cautery. We suggest two alternative forms of gradient model in which late damage can mimic and augment the action of a focus. In the Source/Threshold model, the focus is a morphogen source, and cautery can remove the focus but also transiently lowers the response threshold in surrounding cells. In the Sink model, the focus generates the gradient by removing morphogen, and cautery can eliminate the focus but it also causes a transient destruction or leakage of morphogen. These models can explain most features of the results of cautery.

AB  - Various forms of hydroxyapatite (HAP) materials have been developed for use as bone grafts.  Since the risk of local infection is associated with surgery, it seems reasonable to incorporate drugs such as antibiotics into implant materials.  We therefore investigated the characteristics of drug incorporation into a spherical porous HAP bead (diameter = 8.48 mm, bulk porosity = 0.439) and its in vitro release behavior.  Cefotiam (CTM) was used as a model antibiotic.  Because of nonuniform pore distribution in the bead, distribution of CTM was estimated from the amounts of CTM experimentally determined at three different sites:  the surface, halfway to the center, and the center of the beads.  The results indicated that 90% of the drug was incorporated in the concentric outer 0.387 (radius = 1) section of the bead.  CTM was released with a short lag time when the dry HAP bead was placed in water.  Incorporation of CTM with egg phosphatidylcholine eliminated initial lag time and decreased the release rate of the drug from the bead.  The lipid load was useful in controlling the release of CTM from the beads.  In addition, to protect relatively unstable drugs from humidity and avoid contamination of drug-incorporated HAP beads an apparatus was designed with which the beads could be enclosed in vials in vacuo and under aseptic conditions on a bench-scale basis.

AB  - The vascular amplifier leads to enhancement of all resistance responses, from full dilatation to maximum constriction. The mechanism of resistance amplification is narrowing of the resistance vasculature, which is approximately constant at all levels of vasomotor tone. From the literature, the site of narrowing is localized to the small arteries and large arterioles. The narrowing at rest leads during constriction, to patchy reduction in blood flow in the microcirculation. The enhanced resistance responses of the vascular amplifier during constriction, increase blood pressure (BP) upstream, which minimizes the hemodynamic effects on the microcirculation and helps to maintain venous return. Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is an amplifier of stroke volume and cardiac output. It reinforces the elevation of BP upstream from the site of vascular narrowing. This appears important for the initiation and maintenance of hypertension, in view of findings in SHR showing: (1) that in the course of normal development of hypertension the vascular amplifier properties develop before the onset of hypertension, which occurs in parallel with an increase in rate of LV hypertrophy; (2) after brief periods of enalapril treatment, hypertension redevelops in parallel with the redevelopment of LV hypertrophy, whilst the vascular amplifier properties remain suppressed; (3) treatment with immuno-sympathectomy plus prazosin prevents the development of both LV hypertrophy and hypertension but only produces gradual suppression of the vascular amplifier properties. The role of the sympathetic nervous system on LV-hypertrophy is mediated through alpha-1-adrenoceptors.

TI  - COMPRESSION TESTING TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE STRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOR OF METALS SUBJECT TO FINITE DEFORMATION
T2  - METALLURGICAL TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - We have investigated techniques to conduct a valid single-increment compression experiment to large strains, epsilon almost-equal-to 1.0.  Our investigation included experiments with many different lubricants, specimen-end geometries, five different materials, and temperatures of 22-degrees-C, 315-degrees-C, and 600-degrees-C.  We found that for materials with a work-hardening exponent greater than 0.15 and a slightly positive strain-rate sensitivity, the best technique was to cut concentric grooves into the ends of the compression sample and to use polished platens and a molybdenum-disulfide grease-base lubricant.  This technique gave valid stress/strain data and uniform displacement fields (as determined by metallography of the deformed specimen cross sections).  At all temperatures, satisfactory results were also obtained using a MOLYKOTE spray lubricant.  We investigated both well-lubricated experimental conditions (the concentric specimen grooves and Molygrease lubrication and TEFLON sheet lubrication) as well as poor lubrication conditions.  The poorest lubrication was achieved by using a set of platens which had grooves cut in them to prevent any expansion by the ends of the specimen during deformation.  Up to a compressive strain of 0.5, the load/displacement data from all of these lubrication conditions were almost identical.  This was the case for materials with a work-hardening exponent > 0.15.  Despite the similarity of the "average" stress/strain data to epsilon = 0.5 for all lubrication conditions, metallographic cross sections showed that the deformation was nonuniform for the poorly lubricated experiments.  The results of the experiments show that a single increment compression test can be used to obtain accurate constitutive behavior of many materials to large deformations, epsilon almost-equal-to 1.0.  In addition, we have found that the compression test is relatively insensitive to lubrication conditions for many materials through moderate deformations, epsilon almost-equal-to 0.5.

TI  - INITIATION OF FIRE GROWTH ON FUEL-SOAKED GROUND
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The problem of initial fire spread over fuel-soaked ground was experimentally modeled in detail using a bed of glass beads saturated with n-decane as the fuel.  After igniting the center of the horizontal fuel-soaked surface, the flame spreads concentrically and formed a growing centered flame pillar.  The radial spread velocity of flame pillar base accelerated during the initial fire growth stage.  The dominant mode of heat transfer controlling the spread of the flame pillar base was by flame radiation.  The present study shows some important and fundamental characteristics of the growing flame pillar by using the direct video movie, Schlieren photography, particle trace technique, radiation flux measurement and temperature measurement.  The study considers the spread velocity of the flame pillar base, behavior of the flame pillar, luminous height of the flame as a function of flame base diameter, frequency of flame height fluctuation as a function of flame base diameter, flow pattern of flame-induced convection, variation of flame radiation heat flux with elapsed time, and profile and fluctuation of local gas phase temperature on the axis of flame pillar.
   From the point of view of prevention of subsequent fire hazard, the present study discusses some important experimental results for the development of fire size and flame radiation during the initial stages of a growing flame pillar on the ground which has been soaked by spilled liquid fuels.

CP  - 19TH OPEN SCIENTIFIC MEETING OF THE HIP SOC
AB  - The following are lessons of 30 years of total hip arthroplasty (THA): Prosthetic components should allow for easy preoperative graphic planning with one or two templates only. Polyethylene is the weak link in THA and ought to be replaced by perfectly concentric metallic sockets and femoral heads of casted Cr/Co/Mo alloys. The operating technique should guarantee large exposure, suitable orientation of both components, and adequate fixation. Loosening is correlated with loss of bone stock and changes of the position of the implants. In case of progressive bone loss, one should reoperate already in presence of slight clinical symptoms to prevent more difficult and dangerous revisions. To evaluate objectively the outcome of THA, a combined data and roentgenographic documentation system with standardized terms and scales is necessary.

AB  - The development of a Pulse-Driven Loop Reactor (PDLR), a Pulsed Anaerobic Filter (PAF) and a Pulsed Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (PABR) is described. In a PDLR internal circulation is achieved by a specially designed pulse-nozzle together with a concentric draft tube. In a PAF and PABR an  oscillation is superimposed onto the biosuspension by means of a pulsator unit. Pulsed digesters enhance mass transfer processes. Consequently they facilitate degassing and prevent a build-up of acid spots in sludge beds. Laboratory- and pilot-scale evaluation using highly polluted distillery slops (pear, cherry, raspberry) as industrial wastewater show a COD removal efficiency of 70-80 % at loading rates of 10 - 5 kg/m3*d. Contamination, both by sulfate (2 g/L) and copper (0.2 g/L), has a most adverse effect on anaerobic treatment of cherry-mashes,giving rise to a build-up of volatile fatty acids. Consequences for distillery plant operation are discussed.

AB  - Annual surveys of winter wheat diseases in England and Wales provide information on the relative severity of the leaf and stem-base disease complex. Septoria tritici was the most damaging disease during the 5-year period 1985-1989 causing annual losses estimated to be 0.329 Mt compared with 0.251 Mt and 0.231 Mt for eyespot and mildew, the next most damaging winter wheat diseases. Annual losses during the period averaged 1.078 Mt excluding losses attributable to the fusarium diseases, for which no satisfactory yield loss relationships are available. Sowing date and length of break from cereals exert a strong influence on incidence of eyespot and losses attributable to the disease and, on the basis of these surveys, growing all winter wheat crops after a 1-year break would prevent national losses of approximately 100 kt annually.

AB  - We have recently modeled the structural factors responsible for the increased slope of the dose-vascular resistance response curves in the hindquarter bed under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.  Slope increases when the ratio of wall thickness to internal radius (r(i)) increases and when r(i) decreases, but the slope decreases with greater wall stiffness.  Enhanced slope is an indicator of the vascular amplifier properties.  Resistance at maximum vasodilation in hypertension is also structurally determined and is most affected by a reduction in r(i).  Early treatment studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) suggest that the reduction in r(i) can be reversed, suggesting that it is due to vascular hypertrophy.  The concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle is an amplifier of stroke volume.  Together, the vascular and left ventricular amplifiers contribute about 70% to the elevated total peripheral resistance in renovascular hypertension.  In SHR, the vascular amplifier is present early in postnatal life before the onset of hypertension, which occurs in parallel with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).  The development of the vascular amplifiers appears to be under the control of the renin-angiotensin system, whilst LVH appears to be under sympathoadrenal control, acting through cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors.  Early immunosympathectomy plus prazosin treatment specifically prevents development of LVH in SHR and also prevents hypertension.  In human hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy also plays an important role; after a period of prolonged therapy, the rate of redevelopment of hypertension when the drugs are stopped depends on the degree of regression of LVH during treatment.  We conclude that the early development of vascular and cardiac amplifiers in primary hypertension appears to be genetically determined and the role of the heart in pathogenesis appears to be greater than previously thought.

AB  - A rapid, automated method for isotopic analysis of C-13 and O-18 in CO2 has been developed. A variety of gas samples containing CO2 can be swept from serological tubes into a helium carrier flow; impurities are separated on a GC column so that a pure pulse of CO2 in He flows into the mass spectrometer. Isotopic ratio determinations are carried out as the pulse passes through the mass spectrometer, allowing a sample to be measured every approximately 4 min. A double, concentric needle-probe is used to flush the sample from the tube so that 100% sample recovery is achieved, maximizing sensitivity and preventing the possibility of fractionation. The precision of the technique, sigma(n-1), is better than 0.2 parts per thousand (0.0002 atom per cent excess) for C-13 and 0.4 parts per thousand (0.83 p.p.m.) for O-18 for 10-mu-mol of CO2 at natural abundance. Samples containing only atmospheric concentrations of CO2 can also be analysed.

AB  - Juvenile bay scallops Argopecten irradians commonly attach to shoots of eelgrass Zostera marina using byssal threads. Although this behavior has long been recognized, its adaptive value is poorly understood. This study examined (1) the size-specific nature of scallop attachment on eelgrass, and (2) the possible role of vertical attachment in providing refuge from benthic predators. Laboratory experiments using artificial eelgrass showed strong, inverse relationships between scallop size (over the range 6 to 20 mm) and several measures of attachment performance (percent attachment, rate of attachment, and height-above-bottom attained). Field experiments in which 10 to 15 mm scallops were tethered to natural eelgrass in Lake Montauk, Long Island, New York (USA), demonstrated a dramatic, highly significant enhancement of scallop survival at greater heights of attachment. Scallops tethered at 20 to 35 cm above bottom experienced > 59% survival over 4 d, compared to < 11% survival near the sediment surface. A similar pattern was observed in laboratory tethering experiments using transplanted natural eelgrass and 3 crab predators common in mid-Atlantic embayments: Carcinus maenas, Libinia dubia, and Dyspanopeus sayi. The refuge value of vertical attachment was found, however, to be less with D. sayi than with the other predators tested, since individuals of this species climbed eelgrass to feed on scallops in the upper canopy. These data demonstrate that vertical attachment on eelgrass functions as an effective predator-avoidance mechanism for juvenile bay scallops by placing them out of reach of many benthic predators. It has also been previously shown that scallop predatory risk decreases with scallop size, with a partial size refuge attained at about 40 mm. It is therefore suggested that scallops undergo an ontogenetic shift from a spatial to a size refuge from predation as they move from the eelgrass canopy to the sediment surface over the course of their post-settlement life history. We hypothesize that this shift may result in a critical window of high predatory risk between ca 15 and 40 mm, when scallops are expected to be most susceptible to benthic predators.

AB  - Six control dogs, six dogs treated with 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. quinapril, and six dogs treated with 8 mg/kg q.d. minoxidil underwent 6 hours daily of hindquarter compression for 9 weeks.  Minoxidil significantly decreased baseline blood pressure (-17 mm Hg; p less-than-or-equal-to 0.01), whereas quinapril decreased baseline blood pressure 11 mm Hg but not significantly (p = 0.15).  Hindquarter compression elicited blood pressure increases in all three groups (control +18, quinapril +13, minoxidil +19 mm Hg).  After 9 weeks, left ventricular mass in control dogs increased 22% (p < 0.004); a similar increase was seen in minoxidil-treated dogs (+22%, p < 0.0001) but not in the quinapril-treated group (+4%, p < 0.15).  The increase in left ventricular mass in control dogs was concentric (increased epicardial volume only), whereas in the minoxidil group, the hypertrophy was eccentric (both epicardial and endocardial volumes increased).  The minimal hypertrophy in the quinapril group was concentric (no change in epicardial, but a decrease in endocardial volume).  Quinapril had little hypotensive effect, but prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas minoxidil did not prevent hypertrophy in spite of its hypotensive effect.  The mechanism of this differential effect of direct vasodilation versus converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular hypertrophy is not fully elucidated.  The results with quinapril suggest that some antihypertensive agents may positively affect left ventricular hypertrophy in spite of the absence of a large effect on baseline blood pressure or on blood pressure reactivity.

AB  - Detailed petrographic studies of recent or sub-recent evaporites where many critical environmental parameters are defined can help in the analysis of ancient deposits and in the establishment of chemical and environmental models for evaporite formation.
   The Prungle Lakes are part of the now dry Willandra Lakes system in semi-arid southwestern New South Wales.  The Willandra Lakes have been a site of cyclic Quaternary sedimentation in response to the well documented global climatic fluctuations associated with the glacial-interglacial cycle.  At times of hydrologic stress, low lake levels are associated with high salt volumes, inherited from evaporative concentration in large shallow lakes upstream and the inflow of saline groundwaters.  Thus, at Prungle, a complex array of concentric shorelines, lake floor terraces and lunettes has developed as basin-within-basin landforms which formed in response to filling and drying cycles.  Sediments associated with these geomorphic units include:
   (1) Freshwater littoral, nearshore and deep-water deposited laminated sands and muds, with biogenic carbonates chiefly of ostracodal and algal origin;
   (2) Evaporites comprising interbedded clay and laminated gypsum-clay couplets, which consist of discrete thin laminae of sugary white euhedral prismatic gypsum separated by detrital clay layers with a high degree of optical orientation.  Primary accessory celestite (SrSO4) occurs as discrete patches within the gypsum laminae;
   (3) Groundwater pyramidal, discoidal or lenticular gypsum crystals, grown from supersaturation produced by evaporation at the capillary fringe of the water table.  These have formed displacively within the sediments and caused considerable disruption of the sediment matrix;
   (4) Aeolian deposition in irregular transverse ridges of sand-sized reworked groundwater gypsum and disrupted lacustrine clays.  The gypsum crystals are predominantly discoidal pyramidal forms which are conspicuously oriented parallel to bedding, well sorted and extensively corroded.  The clay pellets are well sorted and moderately well rounded.  Higher in the profile, bedding is indistinct due to pedogenic processes, which include modification of detrital grains and secondary crystallization of gypsum and carbonate.  A thin gypcrete horizon occurs at the surface.
   The last cycle of sedimentation in the Prungle Lakes is believed, from correlation with lakes higher in the Willandra System, to have occurred during the period 50,000-16,000 yr B.P.  Since then groundwaters have dropped below the zone of interaction with the lake floor and surface water no longer reaches the lakes.  Sedimentation has ceased and soil formation with secondary carbonate and gypsum has continued to the present.
   A range of sedimentary environments is identified which depend on strong seasonal oscillations.  These environments are virtually absent from the Australian continent today, and their occurrence during the Pleistocene supports the contention of enhanced climatic seasonality at that time.  The array of sediment types and mineralogies is almost identical to that characteristic of coastal sabkha sequences highlighting the difficulty of relying on unusual evaporative mineralogy to differentiate marine and non-marine environments.
   Detailed petrographic analyses of the Prungle sequence have been made in association with a review of theoretical, experimental and observational studies of the environmental controls of calcium sulfate mineralogy and crystal habit.  This has enabled the correlation at Prungle of depositional environment with gypsum petrofacies and associated compositional, fabric or structural features.  These observations are more generally applicable to other evaporite deposits.  Many gypsum evaporites reported in the literature have been compared with this scheme developed at Prungle.

AB  - The numbers of laboratory-reared males of Chilo partellus (SWINHOE) which were released, both in a screenhouse and in the field, and recaptured in virgin female-baited traps were positively correlated. Pheromone trap catches were reduced by 75-100% when 18 or 36 virgin females were placed in two concentric circles of radii 10 m and 20 m occupying an area of 1,257 sq m. around the trap. Mated females surrounding the trap did not cause a significant decrease in the trap catch. Tethered virigin females surrounding a virgin female-baited trap competed successfully among themselves and with the trap for receptive males, the percentage of the tethered mated females being 58-66% and the catch in the trap reducing by 78-86% compared with that in the control. Thus, although catches of males in pheromone traps increased with the increase in their population density, the efficiency of the trap decreased due to competition with increasing number of calling females in the trap vicinity. The disruption in the catch was not accompanied by a corresponding reduction in mating. The results also demonstrated competition among pheromone traps.

AB  - The acid phosphatase activity during carposporogenesis in Gigartina and tetrasporogenesis in Chondria was studied using the Gomori technique.  During the first steps of gonimoblast maturation of Gigartina, portions of cytoplasm are ensheathed by ER cisternae with acid phosphatase activity, giving rise to autolysosomal concentric membrane bodies.  In a similar way large mucilage sacs are severed.  They extrude their contents in a kind of exocytosis.  Multivescular bodies, concentrically arranged cisternae and extracytoplasmic compartments, each with acid phosphatase activity, remain in young carpospores for some time, probably as remnants of the autophagocytotic and exocytotic events.  The Golgi apparatus is poorly developed in gonimoblast cells and young carpospores.  It becomes a prominent cell component in maturing carpospores and then participates in cell wall formation.  Only some of the dictyosomal cisternae contain acid phosphatase; these are irregularly distributed in the dictyosome. - In pre- and postmeiotic tetraspore mother cells of Chondria massive lead deposits are found in the dictyosomes and in adjacent Golgi vesicles.  Finer lead precipitates occur in ER cisternae, especially in those which are sequestering starch-grain-containing portions of the cytoplasm to give rise to autolysosomes.  During cell cleavage, the dictyosomes aggregate.  They become devoid of acid phosphatase activity with the exception of vesicles at the trans face.  Later, Golgi stacks associate and have common, Gomori positively reacting, narrow cisternae at the cis face.  The Golgi apparatus derived "cored vesicles" do not contain lead precipitates whereas the Golgi cisternae in the final stage of tetrasporogenesis show acid phosphatase activity.  Variations in acid phosphatase distribution are explained in the light of current models of membrane flow.

TI  - AUTHIGENESIS OF FERRIC OOLITES IN SUPERFICIAL SEDIMENTS FROM LAKE MALAWI, CENTRAL AFRICA
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY

KW  - IRON
AB  - Lithological examination of sediments from approximately 250 sampling stations in the Lake Malawi basin revealed the presence of oolitic and pisolitic sequences at four locations, all lying at depths of approximately 100-160 m.  Geochemical analyses showed the oolites to be comprised of concentric shells of hydrous Fe3+ -oxide surrounding siliceous nuclei.  They are also conspicuously enriched with Mn, Zn and Pb in adsorbed and reducible oxide phases.
   Authigenesis of the oolites and pisolites results from the mobilization of Fe2+ in the pore waters of deeply buried anoxic strata and subsequent precipitation of Fe3+ at the sediment-water interface.  This process can operate only at those locations with a two-layer oxic-anoxic sediment column, thus explaining the restriction of oolite beds to relatively shallow-water settings in Lake Malawi, where bottom waters are well oxygenated.  However, there is no surficial Fe enrichment at shallow sites with predominantly non-clastic or pure silt/clay sediments, suggesting that the availability of both reactive Fe and suitable precipitation nuclei constitute additional controls on oolite formation.  The mode of Fe enrichment observed in Lake Malawi may be of some value as a model for more ancient situations, particularly where ironstones have formed in the absence of a definable crustal or volcanogenic Fe source.

AB  - The shear viscosities of 19 galliosilicate and related liquids have been measured using the concentric cylinder method.  Nine of the liquid compositions lie in the Na2O-Ga2O3-SiO2 system, eight liquids correspond in composition to X1/n(n+)GaSi3O8 (where X = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li, Ba, Sr, and Ca), and five liquids are Li silicates related by the exchange of Al, Ga, and Fe.  The measurements were performed at 1 atm of air pressure in the temperature range of 1700-900-degrees-C and a viscosity range of 10(1.3)-10(5) dPaS.  The rotation rates ranged from 0.5 to 100 rpm.
   All melts exhibited Newtonian viscosities.  The viscosities of the X1/n(n+)GaSi3O8 liquids decrease in the order Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li and Ba > Sr > Ca.  Increasing SiO2 content in liquids on the SiO2-NaGaO2 join (NaGaSiO4, NaGaSi2O6, NaGaSi3O8) results in increasing viscosity.  The exchange of Ga2O3 for Na2O along the 75 mol% SiO2 isopleth (Na2Si3O7, Na1.5Ga0.5Si3O7.5, NaGaSi3O8, Na0.5Ga1.5Si3O8.5, Ga2Si3O9) yields a viscosity maximum at NaGaSi3O8.  Comparison with viscosity data for aluminosilicate, ferrosilicate, and borosilicate liquids indicates that viscosities decrease in the order aluninosilicate > galliosilicate > ferrosilicate > borosilicate.  Recent heat of solution measurements on NaXSi3O8 glasses (where X = Al, Fe, Ga, and B), in molten Pb2B2O5 at 973 K indicate that the degree to which glasses are stabilized increases in the order Al > Ga > Fe > B (DeYoreo et al., 1990).  Thus a correlation can be made between liquid viscosity and glassy heat of solution that is similar to that previously noted for the alkali exchange in aluminosilicate melts of the formula XAlSi3O8 (where X = alkali).  Galliosilicate liquids have been used as structural analogues of the aluminosilicates.  The composition-dependence of their viscosities is analogous to the aluminosilicates with the difference that the glass transition occurs at much lower temperatures in galliosilicate liquids.  These results confirm galliosilicate liquids as useful analogues for aluminosilicate liquids in studies where the high vicosities of the latter may prevent experimental determination of certain relaxed liquid properties.
