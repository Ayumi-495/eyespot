AB  - Some visual antipredator strategies involve the rapid movement of highly contrasting body patterns to frighten or confuse the predator. Bright body colouration, however, can also be detected by potential predators and used as a cue. Among spiders, Argiope spp. are usually brightly coloured but they are not a common item in the diet of araneophagic wasps. When disturbed, Argiope executes a web-flexing behaviour in which they move rapidly and may be perceived as if they move backwards and towards an observer in front of the web. We studied the mechanisms underlying web-flexing behaviour as a defensive strategy. Using multispectral images and high-speed videos with deep-learning-based tracking techniques, we evaluated body colouration, body pattern, and spider kinematics from the perspective of a potential wasp predator. We show that the spider’s abdomen is conspicuous, with a disruptive colouration pattern. We found that the body outline of spiders with web decorations was harder to detect when compared to spiders without decorations. The abdomen was also the body part that moved fastest, and its motion was composed mainly of translational (vertical) vectors in the potential predator’s optical flow. In addition, with high contrast colouration, the spider’s movement might be perceived as a sudden change in body size (looming effect) as perceived by the predator. These effects alongside the other visual cues may confuse potential wasp predators by breaking the spider body outline and affecting the wasp’s flight manoeuvre, thereby deterring the wasp from executing the final attack. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The watching eyes effect has gained significant attention in recent years both from scientists and from policy makers and professionals in the field. The phenomenon posits that the mere presence of eye cues can promote prosocial behavior. However, there is a growing debate about the generality of the effect across various measures and contexts. This review seeks to combine various distinct -and formerly isolated- perspectives by identifying four key components for effective interventions based on the watching eyes effect: Anonymity, crowdedness, costs, and exposure. Eye cues need to reduce perceived anonymity, be placed in non-crowded places, target low-cost prosocial acts and appear for a short amount of time. Next to these conditions, we discuss implications for other cues to reputation and recommend directions that will stimulate further research and applications in society. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Many animal taxa perform stereotyped displays during ritualized contests over territory and mates. Such displays facilitate assessment of an opponent's prowess and reduce the probability of physical injury. Color patterns likewise can serve as indicators of an individual's body condition. Male San Cristóbal Lava Lizards (Microlophus bivittatus) of the Galápagos Islands possess a black epaulet on each shoulder that contrasts with their surrounding body coloration. We created robots with the appearance of conspecific males to explore the potential function(s) of the epaulets in a series of four experiments. Our experiments focused on epaulet presence/absence, body location, and location relative to the axis of body motion (pectoral versus pelvic girdle) during pushups. Paired trials were conducted with adult males and females using a robot that performed M. bivittatus signature displays and that differed on its two sides in epaulet attributes. We quantified two kinds of bobbing displays in subjects: signature displays and two-bob displays. We also computed a composite response (CR) score, in which point values were assigned to types of nonbobbing displays and display combinations according to the apparent level of subject aggression. Results of Experiment 1 showed that males (but not females) performed more signature displays to the side of the robot with the epaulet present than to the side with the epaulet absent, suggesting that epaulets serve a signaling function. Composite response scores did not differ between treatments for either sex. In Experiment 2 neither males nor females performed more bobbing displays to an enlarged epaulet than to an epaulet reduced in size. However, males exhibited greater CR scores to the enlarged epaulet, suggesting that epaulet size or conspicuousness is important to its function. In Experiment 3 neither sex produced more bobbing displays to an epaulet on the robot's shoulder than to one on its hip. Yet, males accumulated significantly larger CR scores in response to the shoulder epaulet than to the hip epaulet, indicating that males were aware of normal epaulet location. Finally, in Experiment 4, where our robot performed hindlimb rather than forelimb pushups, subjects failed to exhibit more bobbing displays in response to a shoulder epaulet than to a hip epaulet. CR scores also did not differ between treatments for either sex, perhaps due to the striking abnormality of hindlimb-driven bobbing displays. Although the function of M. bivittatus epaulets remains elusive, these markings clearly are salient to male conspecifics. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous prey traits are the result of the pervasive evolutionary pressure imposed by predators. Mirroring their fundamental role in the fitness of prey, some antipredator defences can evolve into elaborate strategies. Such is the case of the Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), a semiaquatic urodele that inhabits multiple types of inland waterbodies in central and southern Iberian Peninsula and north-western Africa. It possesses sharp, protractile ribs, which can thwart predators by emerging through skin ‘warts’ they pierce, becoming impregnated with the toxicants these warts produce, and making the newts difficult to swallow. Plus, the orange colour of these warts contrasts with the predominantly dull dorsum. In this work, I studied the interactions between the number of these warts, the saliency of wart colour against dorsum colour of each individual (i.e., the difference in colour between the warts and the dorsum), rib response time (i.e., the time needed for the ribs to emerge in response to a standardised stimulus), body size, and locomotor performance in males and females in either their aquatic or terrestrial stage. I also conducted a field experiment to determine whether predators more frequently attacked plasticine models with conspicuous or inconspicuous warts. I found that wart colour saliency functions as a decoy, attracting predator attacks towards this well-protected body part. Plus, many of the antipredator defences studied, namely the number of warts, their colour saliency, rib response time, body size, and locomotor performance, were interrelated. Accordingly, more salient warts indicated a faster rib response, suggesting that these defences are coordinated with each other. Plus, locomotion was considerably slower in the terrestrial than in the aquatic stage. Moreover, warts were more salient, and thus more efficient attracting predator attacks, in newts in the slower terrestrial stage. However, rib response was faster in the aquatic stage, which coincides with the newt's activity peak, and therefore with the height of its conspicuousness to predators. Remarkably, faster newts display less salient warts and a slower rib response, which suggests a trade-off between both defences. Nonetheless, some of these trends are reversed in females, among which faster individuals also display a faster rib response. This could be a likely consequence of reduced predation pressure. These results further the understanding of how prey integrate and tune multiple antipredator defences according to factors that influence predation pressure, such as sex and life stage. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Butterflies are increasingly becoming model insects where basic questions surrounding the diversity of their color patterns are being investigated. Some of these color patterns consist of simple spots and eyespots. To accelerate the pace of research surrounding these discrete and circular pattern elements we trained distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detection and measurement of butterfly spots and eyespots on digital images of butterfly wings. We compared the automatically detected and segmented spot/eyespot areas with those manually annotated. These methods were able to identify and distinguish marginal eyespots from spots, as well as distinguish these patterns from less symmetrical patches of color. In addition, the measurements of an eyespot’s central area and surrounding rings were comparable with the manual measurements. These CNNs offer improvements of eyespot/spot detection and measurements relative to previous methods because it is not necessary to mathematically define the feature of interest. All that is needed is to point out the images that have those features to train the CNN. © 2023 Cunha et al.

AB  - Animal communication, like human communication, is a multimodal phenomenon. Just as humans entwine speech, gestures, bodily postures, noises, and facial expressions when they talk with one another, non-human animals use multiple modalities and senses when communicating with conspecifics. This chapter provides an overview of the ways animals use different sensory channels in their communication. It introduces important biological concepts like sexual selection, honest signaling, information theory, and mimicry. Animal communication relying on sight falls into two broad categories: static traits and dynamic behaviors. Much of the research on acoustic communication focuses on vocalization, but animals use many other types of sounds to communicate as well. Vocalizations can be directed or broadcast. All animals perceive touch, which it is critical in navigating social relationships, particularly during intimate interactions like nursing, play, fighting, and mating. © 2023 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mimarachnidae is a Mesozoic planthopper family, with high palaeodiverisity at generic and species levels during Cretaceous. Herein, geometric morphometric analysis of mimarachinid forewings was executed. Our results of principal component and cluster analyses show that Dachibangus formosus and D. hui are morphologically distinct from the type species of Dachibangus. Therefore, Xiaochibangus gen. nov. is erected, and those two species are transferred to this new genus, resulting in new combinations – Xiaochibangus formosus comb. nov. and X. hui comb. nov. Besides, Jaculistilus xixuanae sp. nov., the second species of Jaculistilus with well-preserved 12 eyespots on tegmina, is described here from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber of northern Myanmar, adding novel knowledge on the palaeodiversity of Mimarachnidae. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two genes, Distal-less (Dll) and spalt (sal), are known to be involved in establishing nymphalid butterfly wing patterns. They function in several ways: in the differentiation of the eyespot’s central signalling cells, or foci; in the differentiation of the surrounding black disc; in overall scale melanisation (Dll); and in elaborating marginal patterns, such as parafocal elements. However, little is known about the functions of these genes in the development of wing patterns in other butterfly families. Here, we study the expression and function of Dll and sal in the development of spots and other melanic wing patterns of the Indian cabbage white, Pieris canidia, a pierid butterfly. In P. canidia, both Dll and Sal proteins are expressed in the scale-building cells at the wing tips, in chevron patterns along the pupal wing margins, and in areas of future scale melanisation. Additionally, Sal alone is expressed in the future black spots. CRISPR knockouts of Dll and sal showed that each gene is required for the development of melanic wing pattern elements, and repressing pteridine granule formation, in the areas where they are expressed. We conclude that both genes likely play ancestral roles in organising distal butterfly wing patterns, across pierid and nymphalid butterflies, but are unlikely to be differentiating signalling centres in pierids black spots. The genetic and developmental mechanisms that set up the location of spots and eyespots are likely distinct in each lineage. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Many prey species possess eyespots: paired markings that often consist of two or more concentric circles. Predators are wary of such prey because eyespots are conspicuous and/or mistaken for vertebrate eyes. Here we used naïve domestic chicks as predators of artificial moth-like prey to test the hypothesis that both eyespots configuration and predator approach direction affect the antipredator efficacy of eyespots. We found that when chicks approached prey straight on, eyespots configuration did not influence attack latency. Chicks that approached from either the left or the right, were slower to attack prey in which the central circle of the eyespot was centrally placed or shifted in the direction of the chick’s approach, compared to prey in which the central circle had been shifted away from the direction of approach. These findings suggest that eyespots composed of concentric circles may protect prey against predators approaching from a wider range of directions than eyespots composed of eccentric circles. They are also consistent with the idea that eyespots are mistaken for eyes, and are perceived to pose a lesser risk when their “gaze” is averted from the approaching predator.

AB  - Predation is a major evolutionary driver of animal adaptation. However, understanding of anti-predator evolution is biased toward vertebrate taxa. Cephalopoda, a class in the invertebrate phylum Mollusca, are known for their diverse anti-predator strategies, characterised by their behavioural flexibility. While ancestral cephalopods were protected by a hard outer shell, extant cephalopods have greatly reduced their reliance on physical defences. Instead, cephalopods have evolved highly developed senses to identify potential threats, cryptic skin patterns to avoid detection, startle responses to deter attack, and elaborate means of escape. While cephalopod anti-predator repertoires are relatively well described, their evolution, and the selective pressures that shaped them, have received much less attention. This is despite their potential relevance, in turn, to elucidate evolution of the remarkable cognitive abilities of cephalopods. Here, we review cephalopod anti-predator evolution, considering four key aspects: (i) shell reduction and loss; (ii) the skin patterning system; (iii) the ecological context accompanying the evolution of advanced cognit.ive abilities; (iv) why the evolutionary trajectory taken by cephalopods is so unique among invertebrates. In doing so, we consider the unique physiology of cephalopods and discuss how this may have constrained or aided the development of their anti-predator repertoire. In particular, cephalopods are poorly equipped to defend themselves physically and escape predation by fish, due to a lack of comparable weaponry or musculature. We argue that this may have selected for alternative forms of defence, driving an evolutionary trajectory favouring crypsis and complex behaviours, and the promotion of sensory and cognitive adaptations. Unravelling the complexities of cephalopod anti-predator evolution remains challenging. However, recent technological developments available for cephalopod field and laboratory studies, coupled with new genomic data and analysis approaches, offer great scope to generate novel insights.

AB  - When constraints on antipredator coloration shift over the course of development, it can be advantageous for animals to adopt different color strategies for each life stage. Many caterpillars in the genus Papilio exhibit unique ontogenetic color sequences: for example, early instars that masquerade as bird feces, with later instars possessing eyespots. I hypothesize that larvae abandon feces masquerade in favor of eyespots due to ontogenetic changes in signaler size. This ontogenetic pattern also occurs within broader seasonal shifts in background color and predator activity. I conducted predation experiments with artificial prey to determine how potential signaling constraints (specifically size and season) shape predation risk, and consequently the expression of ontogenetic color change in Papilio larvae. Seasonally, both predation and background greenness declined significantly from July to September, though there was little evidence that these patterns impacted the effectiveness of either color strategy. Caterpillar size and color strongly affected the attack rate of avian predators: attacks increased with prey size regardless of color, and eyespotted prey were attacked more than masquerading prey overall. These results may reflect a key size-mediated tradeoff between conspicuousness and intimidation in eyespotted prey, and raise questions about how interwoven aspects of behavior and signal environment might maintain the prevalence of large, eyespotted larvae in nature. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Abstract: How and when deimatic behaviours are performed can change during encounters between predators and prey. Some predators attack repeatedly, investigating and manipulating prey, and in response, an individual’s deimatic behaviour may intensify or may diminish in favour of escaping. The presence of a resource can further force a trade-off between displaying and escaping. Here, we examined the intensity of the katydid’s deimatic behaviour, a visual display, the propensity of their escape response under repeated simulated attacks, and how these responses change in the presence of foraging resources. We found that display intensity increased with repeated simulated attacks and that females displayed at a greater intensity than males. The presence of their preferred food plant had no significant effect on display intensity, but reduced escape probability in both sexes. Some katydids were predictable in their display intensity and at the population level we found that strong display intensity is moderately repeatable. Overall, our results suggest that 1) display intensity increases with repeated attacks and might indicate a cost in performing at maximum intensity upon first attack, 2) deploying a deimatic display while feeding can reduce the need to flee a rich foraging patch and 3) some individuals are consistent in their display intensities. Future experiments that aim to determine causal mechanisms such as limitations to perception of predators, sensitisation to stimuli and physiological constraints to display intensity will provide necessary insight into how deimatic displays function. Significance statement: Though often regarded as success or failure, interactions between predators and prey during the attack phase of a predation event are complex, especially when predators make repeated investigative attacks in quick succession. Our study shows that in mountain katydids, intensity of deimatic behaviour increases with repeated attacks, perhaps indicating that prey sensitise or that maximal displays during initial attacks carry high costs such as conspicuousness. The intensity of the display does not change with the introduction of a valuable food resource, but the probability of fleeing decreased, suggesting that displaying may reduce the opportunity costs of leaving a patch. We also show that individuals vary in the repeatability of their display, suggesting that deimatic display may be highly adaptable, nuanced and targeted. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Eyespots are taxonomically widespread color patterns consisting of large concentric rings that are commonly assumed to protect prey by influencing the behaviors of predators. Although there is ample experimental evidence supporting an anti-predator function of eyespots in terrestrial animals, whether eyespots have a similar deterring function in aquatic animals remains unclear. Furthermore, studies in terrestrial systems suggest that the protective function of eyespots depends on ambient light conditions where predators encounter them, but this effect has never been tested in aquatic environments. Here, we examine how eyespots influence behavioral responses in an aquatic environment under different visual environments, using laboratory-reared three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as model predators. Specifically, we experimentally examined behavioral responses of sticklebacks toward artificial prey patterns (control vs. eyespots) under two different light environment treatments (low vs. high). We found that eyespots did not postpone attacks from sticklebacks. However, sticklebacks approaching eyespots stopped more frequently than sticklebacks approaching prey items with a control pattern. Sticklebacks were (marginally) slower to attack prey in the low-light treatment, but the light level did not influence stickleback behavioral responses toward eyespots. We conclude that eyespots can modulate some behaviors of an aquatic predator, albeit with a different functional role from that previously demonstrated in terrestrial species. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are known for having an array of antipredator defenses associated with their wing patterns and color, and they have long been considered model organisms for studies on animal mimicry. One of the most fascinating examples of mimicry in the animal kingdom is that of false heads'-structures that resemble cranial attributes. False heads are predominantly found in the butterfly family Lycaenidae, especially the hairstreak subfamily Theclinae where the false head is found at the posterior margin of the hindwing. These heads are believed to deflect predators to less vulnerable regions of their bodies. False heads are accompanied by a variety of behaviors that may enhance survival, such as walking in a circular pattern and moving hindwings along the sagittal plane. At least five different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why butterflies have evolved false heads in response to predation by visual predators, which we name, summarize, illustrate, and discuss. Our review reveals gaps in our understanding of false head evolution, especially because few experimental studies have tested these hypotheses with appropriate predators. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of each hypothesis and propose avenues for future experimentation. In particular, exploring hypotheses using comparative evolutionary and ecological studies will provide greater understanding of the adaptive significance of these anti-predator structures and behaviors. © 2022 Lepidopterists' Society.

AB  - The ability to fly is crucial for migratory insects. Consequently, the accumulation of damage on the wings over time can affect survival, especially for species that travel long distances. We examined the frequency of irreversible wing damage in the migratory butterfly Vanessa cardui to explore the effect of wing structure on wing damage frequency, as well as the mechanisms that might mitigate wing damage. An exceptionally high migration rate driven by high precipitation levels in their larval habitats in the winter of 2018–2019 provided us with an excellent opportunity to collect data on the frequency of naturally occurring wing damage associated with long-distance flights. Digital images of 135 individuals of V. cardui were collected and analyzed in Germany. The results show that the hindwings experienced a greater frequency of damage than the forewings. Moreover, forewings experienced more severe damage on the lateral margin, whereas hindwings experienced more damage on the trailing margin. The frequency of wing margin damage was higher in the painted lady butterfly than in the migrating monarch butterfly and in the butterfly Pontia occidentalis following artificially induced wing collisions. The results of this study could be used in future comparative studies of patterns of wing damage in butterflies and other insects. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether the strategies for coping with wing damage differ between migratory and nonmigratory species. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Colour is an important component of many different defensive strategies, but signal efficacy and detectability will also depend on the size of the coloured structures, and how pattern size interacts with the background. Consequently, size-dependent changes in colouration are common among many different species as juveniles and adults frequently use colour for different purposes in different environmental contexts. A widespread strategy in many species is switching from crypsis to conspicuous aposematic signalling as increasing body size can reduce the efficacy of camouflage, while other antipredator defences may strengthen. Curiously, despite being chemically defended, the gold-striped frog (Lithodytes lineatus, Leptodactylidae) appears to do the opposite, with bright yellow stripes found in smaller individuals, whereas larger frogs exhibit dull brown stripes. Here, we investigated whether size-dependent differences in colour support distinct defensive strategies. We first used visual modelling of potential predators to assess how colour contrast varied among frogs of different sizes. We found that contrast peaked in mid-sized individuals while the largest individuals had the least contrasting patterns. We then used two detection experiments with human participants to evaluate how colour and body size affected overall detectability. These experiments revealed that larger body sizes were easier to detect, but that the colours of smaller frogs were more detectable than those of larger frogs. Taken together our data support the hypothesis that the primary defensive strategy changes from conspicuous aposematism to camouflage with increasing size, implying size-dependent differences in the efficacy of defensive colouration. We discuss our data in relation to theories of size-dependent aposematism and evaluate the evidence for and against a possible size-dependent mimicry complex with sympatric poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). © 2022 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Deimatic behaviour is performed by prey when attacked by predators as part of an antipredator strategy. The behaviour is part of a sequence that consists of several defences, for example they can be preceded by camouflage and followed by a hidden putatively aposematic signal that is only revealed when the deimatic behaviour is performed. When displaying their hidden signal, mountain katydids (Acripeza reticulata) hold their wings vertically, exposing striking red and black stripes with blue spots and oozing an alkaloid-rich chemical defence derived from its Senecio diet. Understanding differences and interactions between deimatism and aposematism has proven problematic, so in this study we isolated the putative aposematic signal of the mountain katydid's antipredator strategy to measure its survival value in the absence of their deimatic behaviour. We manipulated two aspects of the mountain katydid's signal, colour pattern and whole body shape during display. We deployed five kinds of clay models, one negative control and four katydid-like treatments, in 15 grids across part of the mountain katydid's distribution to test the hypothesis that their hidden signal is aposematic. If this hypothesis holds true, we expected that the models, which most closely resembled real katydids would be attacked the least. Instead, we found that models that most closely resembled real katydids were the most likely to be attacked. We suggest several ideas to explain these results, including that the deimatic phase of the katydid's display, the change from a camouflaged state to exposing its hidden signal, may have important protective value. © 2022 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Eye gaze is an important source of information for animals, implicated in communication, cooperation, hunting and antipredator behaviour. Gaze perception and its cognitive underpinnings are much studied in primates, but the specific features that are used to estimate gaze can be difficult to isolate behaviourally. We photographed 13 laboratory-housed tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus [Cebus] apella) to quantify chromatic and achromatic contrasts between their iris, pupil, sclera and skin. We used colour vision models to quantify the degree to which capuchin eye gaze is discriminable to capuchins, their predators and their prey. We found that capuchins, regardless of their colour vision phenotype, as well as their predators, were capable of effectively discriminating capuchin gaze across ecologically relevant distances. Their prey, in contrast, were not capable of discriminating capuchin gaze, even under relatively ideal conditions. These results suggest that specific features of primate eyes can influence gaze perception, both within and across species. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Predation is a powerful selective force shaping many behavioural and morphological traits in prey species. The deflection of predator attacks from vital parts of the prey usually involves the coordinated evolution of prey body shape and colour. Here, we test the deflection effect of hindwing (HW) tails in the swallowtail butterfly Iphiclides podalirius. In this species, HWs display long tails associated with a conspicuous colour pattern. By surveying the wings within a wild population of I. podalirius, we observed that wing damage was much more frequent on the tails. We then used a standardized behavioural assay employing dummy butterflies with real I. podalirius wings to study the location of attacks by great tits Parus major. Wing tails and conspicuous coloration of the HWs were struck more often than the rest of the body by birds. Finally, we characterized the mechanical properties of fresh wings and found that the tail vein was more fragile than the others, suggesting facilitated escape ability of butterflies attacked at this location. Our results clearly support the deflective effect of HW tails and suggest that predation is an important selective driver of the evolution of wing tails and colour pattern in butterflies. ©

AB  - We describe a new subspecies of day gecko, Phelsuma dorsivittata paradoxa ssp. n. (Squamata: Gekkonidae) from Nosy Be Island and the Sambirano region in northwestern Madagascar. Due to its colouration and small size, Phelsuma d. paradoxa shares at first glance more similarities with P. parva or P. quadriocellata than with P. d. dorsivittata. Yet, phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded DNA sequences unambiguously shows that P. d. paradoxa is relat-ed to the allopatrically distributed P. d. dorsivittata. Due to the substantial and constant morphological divergence and the geographic separation between the two taxa we concluded that assigning them an initial status of subspecies is adequate, although they are not reciprocally monophyletic in mitochondrial DNA. Subsequently we discuss possible scenarios for eyespot convergence and mitochondrial paraphyly within P. dorsivittata. Furthermore, the molecular data presented here confirm the separate position of P. lineata punctulata within the P. dorsivittata complex. In order to resolve the paraphyly of the Phelsuma lineata complex, we here elevate this taxon to species rank, as Phelsuma punctulata Mertens, 1970. © 2022, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Herpetologie, Und Terrarienkunde.

AB  - The war of attrition in game theory is a model of a stand-off situation between two opponents where the winner is determined by its persistence. We model a stand-off between a predator and a prey when the prey is hiding and the predator is waiting for the prey to come out from its refuge, or when the two are locked in a situation of mutual threat of injury or even death. The stand-off is resolved when the predator gives up or when the prey tries to escape. Instead of using the asymmetric war of attrition, we embed the stand-off as an integral part of the predator–prey model of Rosenzweig and MacArthur derived from first principles. We apply this model to study the coevolution of the giving-up rates of the prey and the predator, using the adaptive dynamics approach. We find that the long term evolutionary process leads to three qualitatively different scenarios: the predator gives up immediately, while the prey never gives up; the predator never gives up, while the prey adopts any giving-up rate greater than or equal to a given positive threshold value; the predator goes extinct. We observe that some results are the same as for the asymmetric war of attrition, but others are quite different. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Abstract: The variability of morphological traits (the shape and size of the forewing and the location, number, and diameter of eyespots in the submarginal band of the wing pattern) was studied and analyzed in two species of Satyridae, Aphantopus hyperantus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Erebia ligea (Linnaeus, 1758), occurring sympatrically in Sverdlovsk Province, the Urals. It was originally supposed that micropopulations of the univoltine generalist species A. hyperantus would be weakly isolated and phenotypically homogeneous, since their habitats were positioned a small distance apart (about 10 km) within the same forested area and connected by a network of roads and glades serving as potential dispersal corridors; in contrast, micropopulations of the bicyclic specialist species E. ligea would be more strongly isolated and, accordingly, would have a higher level of phenotypic differentiation. The variability of morphological traits was analyzed by phenetic methods and also by traditional and geometric morphometrics. In both species, significant differences between micropopulations were found in the wing shape and size, as well as in the location and stability of eyespots in the wing pattern. As expected, temporal and spatial isolation of the micropopulations has led to differentiation in E. ligea. At the same time, the initial hypothesis of homogeneity of the A. hyperantus population in the studied territory was not confirmed. The latter case demonstrates that spatial isolation may be sufficient for differentiation in a species that is significantly sedentary and does not fully use the existing dispersal corridors. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Anurans show a wide variety of anti-predator mechanisms, and the species of the Neotropical clade Leiuperinae display several of them. Most species of Edalorhina, Physalaemus and Pleurodema show eyespots, hidden bright colours, macroglands in a inguinal/lumbar position, defensive behaviours and/or chemical defence. We conducted a histological analysis of dorsal and lumbar skin and revised the colour patterns, defensive behaviours and glandular secretions to study the diversity and evolution of anti-predator mechanisms associated with macroglands. We describe 17 characters and optimize these in a phylogenetic hypothesis of Leiuperinae. In the most recent common ancestor of Edalorhina + Engystomops + Physalaemus + Pleurodema, a particular type of serous gland (the main component of macroglands) evolved in the lumbar skin, along with the absence of the Eberth-Katschenko layer. A defensive behaviour observed in leiuperines with macroglands includes four displays ('crouching down' behaviour, rear elevation, body inflation and eye protection), all present in the same ancestor. The two elements associated with aposematism (hidden bright colours and eyespots) evolved independently in several species. Our results provide phylogenetic evidence for the startle-first hypothesis, which suggests that behavioural displays arise as sudden movements in camouflaged individuals to avoid predatory attacks, before the origin of bright coloration. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - Studies on ecological communities often address patterns of species distribution and abundance, but few consider uncertainty in counts of both species and individuals when computing diversity measures. We evaluated the extent to which imperfect detection may influence patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in ecological communities. We estimated the true abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies sampled in canopy and understory strata in a subtropical forest. We compared the diversity values calculated by observed and estimated abundance data through the hidden diversity framework. This framework evaluates the deviation of observed diversity when compared with diversities derived from estimated true abundances and whether such deviation represents a bias or a noise in the observed diversity pattern. The hidden diversity values differed between strata for all diversity measures, except for functional richness. The taxonomic measure was the only one where we observed an inversion of the most diverse stratum when imperfect detection was included. Regarding phylogenetic and functional measures, the strata showed distinct responses to imperfect detection, despite the tendency to overestimate observed diversity. While the understory showed noise for the phylogenetic measure, since the observed pattern was maintained, the canopy had biased diversity for the functional metric. This bias occurred since no significant differences were found between strata for observed diversity, but rather for estimated diversity, with the canopy being more clustered. We demonstrate that ignore imperfect detection may lead to unrealistic estimates of diversity and hence to erroneous interpretations of patterns and processes that structure biological communities. For fruit-feeding butterflies, according to their phylogenetic position or functional traits, the undetected individuals triggered different responses in the relationship of the diversity measures to the environmental factor. This highlights the importance to evaluate and include the uncertainty in species detectability before calculating biodiversity measures to describe communities. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments can provide tight environment-phenotype matching. However, the prerequisite is a reliable environmental cue(s) that enables organisms to use current environmental information to induce the development of a phenotype with high fitness in a forthcoming environment. Here, we quantify predictability in the timing of precipitation and temperature change to examine how this is associated with seasonal polyphenism in tropical Mycalesina butterflies. Seasonal precipitation in the tropics typically results in distinct selective environments, the wet and dry seasons, and changes in temperature can be a major environmental cue. We sampled communities of Mycalesina butterflies from two seasonal locations and one aseasonal location. Quantifying environmental predictability using wavelet analysis and Colwell's indices confirmed a strong periodicity of precipitation over a 12-month period at both seasonal locations compared to the aseasonal one. However, temperature seasonality and periodicity differed between the two seasonal locations. We further show that: (a) most females from both seasonal locations synchronize their reproduction with the seasons by breeding in the wet season but arresting reproduction in the dry season. In contrast, all species breed throughout the year in the aseasonal location and (b) species from the seasonal locations, but not those from the aseasonal location, exhibited polyphenism in wing pattern traits (eyespot size). We conclude that seasonal precipitation and its predictability are primary factors shaping the evolution of polyphenism in Mycalesina butterflies, and populations or species secondarily evolve local adaptations for cue use that depend on the local variation in the environment. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Adaptations for predator defense are often complex traits with integrated display components spanning multiple signaling modalities. For antipredator coloration like deimatic or startle coloration, behavioral variation controlling dynamic color displays is an important but poorly understood component of the predator defense in most taxa. We studied antipredator behavior in North American ringneck snakes (Diadophis punctatus), which possess a brightly colored (red to yellow) ventral surface of the body and the tail compared to the mostly gray dorsal coloration. We sought to (a) characterize intraspecific variation in antipredator behaviors in ringneck snakes and (b) test which stimuli can induce antipredator displays. First, we assessed antipredator displays in the field and during routine handling during data collection by comparing categorical classifications of all displayed behavior across 25 individuals. Second, we performed experimental assays with tactile and visual stimuli to determine the cues that can elicit an antipredator display in ringneck snakes. We found that antipredator displays include ventral displays and tail-coiling and that these components were induced by tactile cues in the field and the lab, but not visual cues. Our work is the first to show that a snake species with bright ventral coloration uses this behavior in response to tactile cues from a potential predator, but only in response to relatively strong stimuli (i.e., handling). This experimental evidence that tactile stimuli can induce a behavior revealing bright ventral coloration highlights the importance of correlated evolution of antipredator coloration and behavior. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - There are fewer eyespots on the forewings versus hindwings of nymphalids but the reasons for this uneven distribution remain unclear. One possibility is that, in many butterflies, the hindwing covers part of the ventral forewing at rest and there are fewer forewing sectors to display eyespots (covered eyespots are not continuously visible and are less likely to be under positive selection). A second explanation is that having fewer forewing eyespots confers a selective advantage against predators. We analysed wing overlap at rest in 275 nymphalid species with eyespots and found that many have exposed forewing sectors without eyespots: i.e. wing overlap does not constrain the forewing from having the same number or more eyespots than the hindwing. We performed two predation experiments with mantids to compare the relative fitness of and attack damage patterns on two forms of Bicyclus anynana butterflies, both with seven hindwing eyespots, but with two (in wild-type) or four (in Spotty) ventral forewing eyespots. Spotty experienced more intense predation on the forewings, were shorter-lived and laid fewer eggs. These results suggest that predation pressure limits forewing eyespot number in B. anynana. This may occur if attacks on forewing eyespots have more detrimental consequences for flight than attacks on hindwing eyespots. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Bycatch of seabirds in gillnet fisheries is a global conservation issue with an estimated 400 000 seabirds killed each year. To date, no underwater deterrents trialled have consistently reduced seabird bycatch across operational fisheries. Using a combination of insights from land-based strategies, seabirds' diving behaviours and their cognitive abilities, we developed a floating device exploring the effect of large eyespots and looming movement to prevent vulnerable seabirds from diving into gillnets. Here, we tested whether this novel above-water device called 'Looming eyes buoy' (LEB) would consistently deter vulnerable seaducks from a focal area. We counted the number of birds present in areas with and without LEBs in a controlled experimental setting. We show that long-tailed duck Clangula hyemalis abundance declined by approximately 20-30% within a 50 m radius of the LEB and that the presence of LEBs was the most important variable explaining this decline. We found no evidence for a memory effect on long-tailed ducks but found some habituation to the LEB within the time frame of the project (62 days). While further research is needed, our preliminary trials indicate that above-water visual devices could potentially contribute to reduce seabird bycatch if appropriately deployed in coordination with other management measures. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In general, butterfly ventral hind wing eyespots are considered to play a role in predator-prey interactions. These eyespots are prominent wing pattern elements in Brassolini butterflies, and they vary in size, position, and number across taxa. Female Caligo Hübner, 1819 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) appear to use the large eyespots of lekking males as a mate-locating cue, but female Opsiphanes Doubleday, 1849 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) do not because males patrol to find mates. These behaviors led us to predict that male Caligo should have larger eyespots than females, but eyespot size would not differ between sexes in Opsiphanes. Our analyses supported these predictions. As displacement of the eyespots to the center of the wing might make them more conspicuous, we asked if eyespot position and size covaried across the Brassolini phylogeny. While we found a positive association between position and size, the relationship of these two variables contained significant phylogenetic signal. Two Brassolini species show strong sexual dimorphism where females converge on the color pattern of sympatric species of Caligo. Their ventral hind wing eyespots are much larger than those of close relatives, approximating those of Caligo, and further reinforcing the importance of ventral hind wing eyespots as a visual signal in this group of butterflies. Importantly, our results suggest that, in addition to antipredation defense, ventral hind wing eyespots can function in mating activities, and consequently they might be evolving under both natural and sexual selection in Caligo butterflies. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Evolution via natural selection has continually shaped the coloration of numerous organisms. One coloration of particular importance is the eyespot: a phylogenetically widespread, conspicuous marking that has been shown to effectively reduce predation, often through its resemblance to the eye. Although widely studied, most research has been experimental in nature. We approach eyespots using a comparative phylogenetic framework that is global in scope. Herein, we identify the potential drivers of eyespot evolution in coral reef fishes; essentially the rules that govern their appearance in this group of organisms. We surveyed 2664 reef fish species (42% of all described reef fish species) and found that eyespots are present in approximately one in every 10 species. Most eyespots occur in closely related species and have been present in some families for over 50 million years. Focusing on damselfishes (family: Pomacentridae) as a study group, we reveal that eyespots are rare in planktivorous species, which is likely driven by the predation risk associated with their feeding location. Using a heatmapping technique, we also show that the location of eyespots is fundamentally different in active fishes that swim above the benthos vs. cryptobenthic fishes that rest on the benthos. These location differences may reflect different functions of eyespots among reef fish species. © 2021 The Authors. Evolution © 2021 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - The strategies underlying different forms of protective coloration are well understood but little attention has been paid to the ecological, life-history and behavioural circumstances under which they evolve. While some comparative studies have investigated the ecological correlates of aposematism, and background matching, the latter particularly in mammals, few have examined the ecological correlates of other types of protective coloration. Here, we first outline which types of defensive coloration strategies may be exhibited by the same individual; concluding that many protective coloration mechanisms can be employed simultaneously, particularly in conjunction with background matching. Second, we review the ecological predictions that have been made for each sort of protective coloration mechanism before systematically surveying phylogenetically controlled comparative studies linking ecological and social variables to antipredator defences that involve coloration. We find that some a priori predictions based on small-scale empirical studies and logical arguments are indeed supported by comparative data, especially in relation to how illumination affects both background matching and self-shadow concealment through countershading; how body size is associated with countershading, motion dazzle, flash coloration and aposematism, although only in selected taxa; how immobility may promote background matching in ambush predators; and how mobility may facilitate motion dazzle. Examination of nearly 120 comparative tests reveals that many focus on ecological variables that have little to do with predictions derived from antipredator defence theory, and that broad-scale ecological studies of defence strategies that incorporate phylogenetics are still very much in their infancy. We close by making recommendations for future evolutionary ecological research. © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society

AB  - The Brown Vine Snake, Oxybelis aeneus, was until recently considered a single species, distributed from southern Arizona through the Neotropics into southeastern Brazil. However, newly conducted research restructured the species with a substantial taxonomic revision, recognizing five additional taxa (i.e. O. koehleri, O. microphthalmus, O. potosiensis, O. rutherfordi, O. vittatus) in this species complex. This revision focused on populations in North America, Central America, and northern South America while neglecting the southern portion of its distribution. Here, we examine the taxonomic history of the complex and use it along with specimen data to resurrect O. acuminatus from southeastern Brazil. Finally, we describe a new species from the Peruvian Amazon based on morphological characters. This work increases the species diversity of the O. aeneus complex to eight, and we expect further increases in biodiversity discoveries with continued exploration of the New World vine snakes. © 2021 Pensoft Publishers.

AB  - Palatinarkema prokopi gen. et sp. nov., the third German representative of the late Carboniferous-early Permian archaeorthopteran clade Cnemidolestidae is described and figured. It is compared to the other known genera. We discuss putative aspects of the paleoecology of these stick-insect-like “orthopteroids”, based on their body and leg structures, plus the presence of a high disparity of color patterns in their forewings, suggesting an important diversity of biology and habitats for these insects. Their elongate bodies and legs show some similarities with the extant but distantly related stick insects. Cnemidolestids possibly expressed cryptic behaviours among the vegetation, using disruptive colors but also ovale eye-like spots, as in the extant insects. © 2021 A. Nel and M.J. Poschmann.

AB  - Eyespots evolved independently in many taxa as anti-predator signals. There remains debate regarding whether eyespots function as diversion targets, predator mimics, conspicuous startling signals, deceptive detection, or a combination. Although eye patterns and gaze modify human behaviour, anti-predator eyespots do not occur naturally in contemporary mammals. Here we show that eyespots painted on cattle rumps were associated with reduced attacks by ambush carnivores (lions and leopards). Cattle painted with eyespots were significantly more likely to survive than were cross-marked and unmarked cattle, despite all treatment groups being similarly exposed to predation risk. While higher survival of eyespot-painted cattle supports the detection hypothesis, increased survival of cross-marked cattle suggests an effect of novel and conspicuous marks more generally. To our knowledge, this is the first time eyespots have been shown to deter large mammalian predators. Applying artificial marks to high-value livestock may therefore represent a cost-effective tool to reduce livestock predation. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Animal colouration is often a trade-off between background matching for camouflage from predators, and conspicuousness for communication with con- or heterospecifics. Stomatopods are marine crustaceans known to use colour signals during courtship and contests, while their overall body colouration may provide camouflage. However, we have little understanding of how stomatopods perceive these signals in their environment or whether overall body coloration does provide camouflage from predators. Neogonodactylus oerstedii assess meral spot colour during contests, and meral spot colour varies depending on local habitat. By calculating quantum catch for N. oerstedii’s 12 photoreceptors associated with chromatic vision, we found that variation in meral spot total reflectance does not function to increase signal contrast in the local habitat. Neogonodactylus oerstedii also show between-habitat variation in dorsal body colouration. We used visual models to predict a trichromatic fish predator’s perception of these colour variations. Our results suggest that sandy and green stomatopods are camouflaged from a typical fish predator in rubble fields and seagrass beds, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate signal contrast and camouflage in a stomatopod. These results provide new insight into the function and evolution of colouration in a species with a complex visual system. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Development can bias the independent evolution of traits sharing ontogenetic pathways, making certain evolutionary changes less likely. The eyespots commonly found on butterfly wings each have concentric rings of differing colors, and these serially repeated pattern elements have been a focus for evo–devo research. In the butterfly family Nymphalidae, eyespots have been shown to function in startling or deflecting predators and to be involved in sexual selection. Previous work on a model species of Mycalesina butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, has provided insights into the developmental control of the size and color composition of individual eyespots. Experimental evolution has also shown that the relative size of a pair of eyespots on the same wing surface is highly flexible, whereas they are resistant to diverging in color composition, presumably due to the underlying shared developmental process. This fixed color composition has been considered as a prime example of developmental bias with significant consequences for wing pattern evolution. Here, we test this proposal by surveying eyespots across the whole subtribe of Mycalesina butterflies and demonstrate that developmental bias shapes evolutionary diversification except in the genus Heteropsis which has gained independent control of eyespot color composition. Experimental manipulations of pupal wings reveal that the bias has been released through a novel regional response of the wing tissue to a conserved patterning signal. Our study demonstrates that development can bias the evolutionary independence of traits, but it also shows how bias can be released through developmental innovations, thus, allowing rapid morphological change, facilitating evolutionary diversification. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A number of strategies that divert attacks of visually guided predators, such as birds, have evolved multiple times in animals. Detritus web decorations built by certain orb-web spider species are thought to deflect avian predator attacks away from spiders and towards their web decorations. Still, empirical evidence for this function and its adaptive significance is lacking. The orb-web spider, Cyclosa monticola, adorns its web using a linear detritus decoration consisting of moults, egg sacs, prey remains and leaf litters. In the present study, we investigated whether detritus decorations constructed by C. monticola spiders divert attacks of avian predators away from spiders. We first employed colour modelling to compare spider bodies and detritus decoration colouration from the perspective of domestic chicks and blue tits. We then experimentally tested the deflection hypothesis in the laboratory using naïve chicks as predators. We put the chicks in a cage containing a web either with (S+) or without (S−) a spider and either with (D+) or without (D−) detritus decoration (a total of four types of webs: S+D+, S+D−, S−D+ and S−D−) under both natural habitat background and white background. We found that the colour of C. monticola spiders is indistinguishable from that of their detritus decorations for both chicks and blue tits with both backgrounds. Laboratory predation experiments showed that with both backgrounds, chicks attacked the spiders much less frequently when their decorations were present on the webs (S+D+; natural habitat: 20%, white background: 30%) than when their decorations were absent (S+D−; natural habitat: 95%, white background: 85%), resulting in greater spider survival advantage. We also found that the rate of attack of spiders and their decorations was not random; the decorations were more likely to be attacked than spiders, regardless of the ratio of surface area of decorations to spider bodies when both spiders and decorations were presented (S+D+). Therefore, our results support a deflection, rather than concealment hypothesis for web decorations. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the extended phenotypes beyond the animal bodies, can divert avian predator attacks, therefore, may improve the fitness of animals.

AB  - Antipredatory displays that incorporate hidden contrasting coloration are found in a variety of different animals. These displays are seen in organisms that have drab coloration at rest, but when disturbed reveal conspicuous coloration. Examples include the bright abdomens of mountain katydids and the colorful underwings of hawk moths. Such hidden displays can function as secondary defenses, enabling evasion of a pursuant predator. To begin to understand why some species have these displays while others do not, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate factors associated with the evolution of hidden contrasting coloration in leaf-footed bugs. First, we investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with body size because these displays are considered to be more effective in larger organisms. We then investigated whether hidden contrasting coloration was associated with an alternative antipredatory defense, in this case rapid autotomy. We found that leaf-footed bugs with hidden contrasting coloration tended to autotomize more slowly, but this result was not statistically significant. We also found that the presence of a body size association was dependent upon the form of the hidden color display. Leaf-footed bugs that reveal red/orange coloration were the same size, on average, as species without a hidden color display. However, species that reveal white patches on a black background were significantly larger than species without a hidden color display. These results highlight the diversity of forms that hidden contrasting color signal can take, upon which selection may act differently. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Numerous organisms display conspicuous eyespots. These eye-like patterns have been shown to effectively reduce predation by either deflecting strikes away from nonvital organs or by intimidating potential predators. While investigated extensively in terrestrial systems, determining what factors shape eyespot form in colorful coral reef fishes remains less well known. Using a broadscale approach we ask: How does the size of the eyespot relate to the actual eye, and at what size during ontogeny are eyespots acquired or lost? We utilized publicly available images to generate a dataset of 167 eyespot-bearing reef fish species. We measured multiple features relating to the size of the fish, its eye, and the size of its eyespot. In reef fishes, the area of the eyespot closely matches that of the real eye; however, the eyespots “pupil” is nearly four times larger than the real pupil. Eyespots appear at about 20 mm standard length. However, there is a marked decrease in the presence of eyespots in fishes above 48 mm standard length; a size which is tightly correlated with significant decreases in documented mortality rates. Above 75–85 mm, the cost of eyespots appears to outweigh their benefit. Our results identify a “size window” for eyespots in coral reef fishes, which suggests that eyespot use is strictly body size-dependent within this group. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Butterflies are among the most colourful organisms in the world and colour plays a central role in many of their life-history strategies. However, the efficacy of coloration strategies in these and other animals could be affected by sudden environmental changes, including anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Here we investigate the effect of forest disturbance gradients on the colours of fruit-feeding butterflies in the Amazon Rainforest. The disturbance gradients tested represented habitat-size (continuous primary forests versus forest fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha) and succession gradients (continuous primary forests, 30 year old secondary forests, and three year old early successional forests). Using digital image analysis, we obtained intrinsic measures of butterfly colour patches corresponding to hue, saturation, brightness, in addition to measures of the contrast among patches and of the overall wing-colour diversity corresponding to 220 individuals, belonging to 60 species. Our results showed that butterflies in the secondary forest and continuous primary forest are more colourful than those found in early succession and fragments of forests. Individuals occurring in forests of early succession showed higher average values of hue and saturation, but lower brightness. Accompanying changes in colour composition, wing-colour diversity among species was lower in human-disturbed habitats, such as those of early forest succession and secondary forest. Forest fragments have smaller effects on butterfly colour composition, indicating that well-structured forest habitats can house butterfly assemblages with more diverse phenotypic features and colours. We show how high deforestation rates in recent years is linked with negative changes in functional coloration strategies (e.g. camouflage, warning colours), something that has to date been poorly explored or demonstrated for butterflies. Specifically, human interference has apparently placed butterflies under strong selection for lower diversity in their colours and range of defensive strategies. Those species that are most colourful are the first to be locally extinguished, likely due to removal of native vegetation and increased exposure to predators, and more broadly owing to inhospitable environmental conditions. This illustrates an accelerated loss of local fauna and a “discolouration” of the Amazonian butterflies due to anthropogenic impacts. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Understanding the adaptive function of conspicuous coloration has been a major focus of evolutionary biology for much of the last century. Although considerable progress has been made in explaining how conspicuous coloration can be used in functions as diverse as sexual and social signaling, startling predators, and advertising toxicity [1], there remain a multitude of species that display conspicuous coloration that cannot be explained by existing theory. Here we detail a new “matador-like” divertive antipredator strategy based on conspicuous coloration in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Guppies encountering predatory fish rapidly enhance the conspicuousness of their eyes by blackening their irises. By pitting biomimetic robotic guppies against real predatory fish, we show this conspicuous eye coloration diverts attacks away from the guppies’ center of mass to their head. To determine the function of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior, we developed a method for simulating escape probabilities when live prey interact with ballistic attacking predators, and find this diversion effect significantly benefits black-eyed guppies because they evade capture by rapidly pivoting away from the predator once it has committed to its attack. Remarkably, this antipredator strategy reverses the commonly observed negative scaling relationship between prey size and evasive ability, with larger fish benefiting most from diverting predators. Taken together, our results introduce a new antipredator divertive strategy that may be widely used by conspicuously colored prey that rely on agility to escape their predators. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Combining biomimetic robots and predation simulations, Heathcote et al. detail a new “matador-like” antipredator strategy in guppies. By blackening their eyes, guppies divert predator lunges to their head, which they evade via a split-second maneuver. This strategy may allow increased body sizes by ameliorating the reduced agility of larger prey. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Eyespots are wing color pattern elements repeatedly observed in many butterflies, whose developmental genetics has been extensively documented. Nevertheless, the evolutionary forces shaping their diversification across species still remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the evolution of eyespots in the 30 species of the neotropical genus Morpho. Morpho butterflies display a series of eyespots located on the ventral side of their wings, highly variable among species, ranging from large, conspicuous structures to vestigial spots. Applying geometric morphometrics to a large sample (N = 910) spanning all Morpho species and both sexes, we assess eyespot number, position, size, and shape. We detect a divergence in eyespot position between understory and canopy species, with an L-shaped configuration in canopy species and a line pattern in understory species, where the eyespots tend to fuse and form a stripe in white and pale species. This effect is stronger than expected based on a Brownian motion model of phylogenetic divergence, suggesting an adaptation to the microhabitat and an influence of the wing color on the evolution of pattern elements. Remarkably, this shift in color pattern is strongly correlated with a shift in wing shape. However, using a thin-plate spline interpolation, we show that the shape change is insufficient to explain the evolution of eyespot position as a developmental side effect of wing shape evolution, also pointing at an adaptive effect. Finally, we find a significant negative correlation between eyespot relative size and the within-species variation in eyespot number, position, size, and shape, suggesting a relaxed or apostatic selection on small eyespots (rare phenotypes being favored as they are less likely to be remembered and thus detected by predators). We hypothesize that contrasted ecology may explain the observed differences between species: large and phenotypically stable eyespots might act as attack deflectors, small, variable faded eyespots might rather enhance crypsis, and pale species stripe pattern might disrupt the outline of the wing. © Copyright © 2020 Debat, Chazot, Jarosson, Blandin and Llaurens.

AB  - Long noted by naturalists, leaf mimicry provides some of the most impressive examples of camouflage through masquerade. Many species of leaf-mimicking Lepidoptera also sport wing markings that closely resemble irregularly shaped holes caused by decay or insect damage. Despite proposals that such markings can either enhance resemblance to damaged leaves or act to disrupt surface appearance through false depth cues, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to establish exactly how these markings function, or even whether they confer a survival benefit to prey. Here, in two field experiments using artificial butterfly-like targets, we show that false hole markings provide significant survival benefits against avian predation. Furthermore, in a computer-based visual search experiment, we demonstrate that detection of such targets by humans is impeded in a similar fashion. Equally contrasting light marks do not have the same effect; indeed, they lead to increased detection. We conclude that the mechanism is the disruption of the otherwise homogeneous wing surface (surface disruptive camouflage) and that, by resembling the holes sometimes found in real leaves, the disruptive benefits are not offset by conspicuousness costs. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - When faced with a predator, some animals engage in a deimatic display to startle the predator momentarily, resulting in a pause or retreat, thereby increasing their chance of escape. Frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) are characterised by a large, pronounced frill that extends from the base of the head to beyond the neck and, when displayed, can be up to six times the width of the head. We used behavioural assays with a model avian predator to demonstrate that their display conforms to deimatic display theory. First, juveniles and adults deployed the frill in encounters with a model predator. Second, the display revealed three colour patches (white and red-orange patches on the frill; yellow mouth palate) that facilitate a transition from a cryptic to a conspicuous state as perceived by a raptor visual system. Third, the display was performed with movements that amplified its effect. The frill area was larger in males than in females, which suggests that the frill might also be co-opted for male-male contests. If future research confirms a role of the frill in male agonistic interactions, frillneck lizards will be a rare case in which a structure has a dual function in a deimatic display and a sexually selected signal. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - This book presents a readable account of butterfly behaviour, based on field observations, great photographs and the latest research. The main focus is on courtship and mating - including perching, searching and territorial behaviour - but to understand these subjects it is necessary to explain how mates are chosen and this requires sections on wing colours and patterns. A chapter on butterfly vision is also essential in terms of how butterflies see the world and each other. There have been exciting discoveries in all of these fields in recent years, including: Butterfly vision (butterfly photoreceptors), wing patterns (molecular biology), wing colouration (structural colours and nano-architecture), mating strategies and female choice (ecology and behaviour). © Raymond J.C.

AB  - Gene duplication provides a major source of new genes for evolutionary novelty and ecological adaptation. However, the maintenance of duplicated genes and their relevance to adaptive evolution has long been debated. Insect trehalase (Treh) plays key roles in energy metabolism, growth, and stress recovery. Here, we show that the duplication of Treh in Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is linked with their adaptation to various environmental stresses. Generally, two Treh genes are present in insects: Treh1 and Treh2. We report three distinct forms of Treh in lepidopteran insects, where Treh1 was duplicated into two gene clusters (Treh1a and Treh1b). These gene clusters differ in gene expression patterns, enzymatic properties, and subcellular localizations, suggesting that the enzymes probably underwent sub- and/or neofunctionalization in the lepidopteran insects. Interestingly, selective pressure analysis provided significant evidence of positive selection on duplicate Treh1b gene in lepidopteran insect lineages. Most positively selected sites were located in the alpha-helical region, and several sites were close to the trehalose binding and catalytic sites. Subcellular adaptation of duplicate Treh1b driven by positive selection appears to have occurred as a result of selected changes in specific sequences, allowing for rapid reprogramming of duplicated Treh during evolution. Our results suggest that gene duplication of Treh and subsequent functional diversification could increase the survival rate of lepidopteran insects through various regulations of intracellular trehalose levels, facilitating their adaptation to diverse habitats. This study provides evidence regarding the mechanism by which gene family expansion can contribute to species adaptation through gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Environmental gradients consist of sequential changes in the physical and structural characteristics of a region. These allow us to follow species responses and tolerances under different habitat conditions. Among them, forest fragmentation and succession comprise the most common examples of forest gradients, where organismal responses require distinct morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. However, environmental changes can impose ecological and evolutionary constraints that act on species traits, as well as on local species assemblies through their phylogenetic history. In this study, we evaluated the differences in species distribution and composition on fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages along forest fragmentation and succession gradients. We combine functional and phylogenetic methods for determining butterfly assemblages, and inferred species resistance and resilience according to habitat changes in tropical forests. We used a database of 471 fruit-feeding butterflies of 60 species sampled from different environments in the central Amazon rainforest. A total of 13 functional traits were measured, and a phylogenetic tree was obtained for the sampled species. The trait–environment relationship was analyzed along both forest fragmentation and succession gradients, controlling for phylogenetic signal on species distribution and functional composition when necessary. Several traits presented phylogenetic signal, and phylogeny was also driving butterfly species distribution along the successional gradient. After controlling for phylogeny, individual characteristics related to flight speed (thoracic weight) and anti-predatory strategies (camouflage) increased in early-successional forests, with large butterflies (body length) prevailing in primary forests. No clear functional and phylogenetic pattern was identified for the fragmentation gradient. Our results are consistent with the idea that butterflies may be employing distinct functional strategies to attenuate habitat change effects. Larger butterflies, with lower dispersal ability, are preferentially susceptible to local extinctions in the early-successional environments, mainly when forested habitat and its resources become spatially restricted. In addition, several anti-predatory strategies related to conspicuous colors may be losing their functionality in open areas, where not being distinctive against the background becomes the primary defense against predation. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Many fishes, both freshwater or marine, have colour vision that may outperform humans. As a result, to understand the behavioural tasks that vision enables; including mate choice, feeding, agonistic behaviour and camouflage, we need to see the world through a fish's eye. This includes quantifying the variable light environment underwater and its various influences on vision. As well as rapid loss of light with depth, light attenuation underwater limits visual interaction to metres at most and in many instances, less than a metre. We also need to characterize visual sensitivities, fish colours and behaviours relative to both these factors. An increasingly large set of techniques over the past few years, including improved photography, submersible spectrophotometers and genetic sequencing, have taken us from intelligent guesswork to something closer to sensible hypotheses. This contribution to the special edition on the Ecology of Fish Senses under a shifting environment first reviews our knowledge of fish colour vision and visual ecology, past, present and very recent, and then goes on to examine how climate change may impinge on fish visual capability. The review is limited to mostly colour vision and to mostly reef fishes. This ignores a large body of work, both from other marine environments and freshwater systems, but the reef contains examples of many of the challenges to vision from the aquatic environment. It is also a concentrate of life, perhaps the most specious and complex on earth, suffering now catastrophically from the consequences of our lack of action on climate change. A clear course of action to prevent destruction of this habitat is the need to spend more time in it, in the study of it and sharing it with those not fortunate enough to see coral reefs first-hand.

AB  - In warm climates, lizards may be important as predators of butterflies and thus exert selection pressure on butterfly colour patterns, including eyespots. However, this has received little attention. Two studies reported no evidence that butterfly eyespots deflect lizard attacks, while possible intimidating effects of butterfly eyespots on lizards have not been investigated. We exposed common evening brown butterflies (Melanitis leda) with a wide range of eyespot sizes (dry season forms with very small and faint eyespots, intermediate phenotypes with small eyespots, and wet season forms with large or very large eyespots) to house geckos, and recorded the location and shape of wing surface loss. We supplemented these data with direct observations of attacks of house geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus) and bronze skinks (Eutropis macularia) on common evening brown butterflies. We found that about three quarters of symmetrical wing surface loss, and about half of the non-symmetrical wing surface loss was rounded like the mouth of a gecko. Symmetrical as well as non-symmetrical wing surface loss was significantly more common in hindwings. We surmise that rounded wing surface loss and a bias in symmetrical wing surface loss to hindwings can be taken as evidence for failed lizard attacks. Rounded wing surface loss was more common in butterflies with small eyespots than in those with very small eyespots or with large eyespots. This suggests that small eyespots can deflect lizard attacks away from the head towards the wing margins, and that large eyespots can thwart lizard attacks. In four cases, skinks appeared to explore rather than attack butterfly eyespots. In contrast to earlier studies, our data provide evidence that butterfly eyespots can be an effective defence against lizards, and thus that predation by lizards can select for eyespots in butterflies. © 2019 Lepidopterists' Society.

AB  - Bycatch is a cause of mortality among marine mammals, sea turtles, fish and birds. For some species this mortality may be sufficient to cause population declines. The Baltic Sea is a global ‘hotspot’ for bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries and is globally important for wintering sea ducks, but no technical solution has been found yet to reduce bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the Baltic. Here, we report on trials conducted in the Baltic Sea to test whether two different gillnet modifications with visual stimuli can effectively reduce bird bycatch while maintaining volume of fish caught. We conducted paired trials of two types of visual stimuli attached to nets: 1)high contrast monochrome net panels and 2)net lights (constant green and flashing white LED lights). We measured the amount of fish and birds caught in standard nets and those modified with the visual stimuli. Neither of the two most commonly caught species, Long- tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis)and Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca), were deterred from lethal encounters with nets by either black-and-white panels or by steady green or flashing white net lights. Long-tailed Ducks were caught in larger numbers in nets equipped with flashing white net lights than in unmodified nets at the same location. Catch rates of commercial fish were not affected by net lights or net panels placed within the nets. Hence, while the deterrents that we tested successfully maintained fish catch, they failed to reduce bird bycatch and are therefore ineffective. We discuss likely avenues for future investigation of bycatch mitigation methods for gillnet fisheries, including species and location response to net lights, managed fishery closures, above-water distraction of birds and gear switching. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Colorful feathers have long been assumed to be conspicuous to predators, and hence likely to incur costs due to enhanced predation risk. However, many mammals that prey on birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors, rather than the three and four photoreceptors characteristic of humans and most birds, respectively. Here, we use a combination of multispectral imaging, reflectance spectroscopy, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators from multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus), as well as red and yellow parrot feathers. We also model the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by birds against green vegetation, most of the feathers studied are estimated to have color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. On the other hand, for dichromat mammalian predators, visual contrasts for these feathers were only weakly detectable and often below detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We also show that for dichromat mammal vision models, the peacock’s train has below-detection threshold color and brightness contrasts and visual textures that match various foliage backgrounds. These findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue to those studied here being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of common mammalian predators of adult birds. Given that birds perform many conspicuous motions and behaviors, this study suggests that mammalian predators are more likely to use other sensory modalities (e.g., motion detection, hearing, and olfaction), rather than color vision, to detect avian prey. This suggests new directions for future behavioral studies and emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the sensory ecology of predators in the evolution of animal coloration. © 2019 Kane et al.

AB  - Color patterns provide easy access to phenotypic diversity and allow the questioning of the adaptive value of traits or the constraints acting on phenotypic evolution. Reef fish offer a unique opportunity to address such questions because they are ecologically and phylogenetically diverse and have the largest variety of pigment cell types known in vertebrates. In addition to recent development of their genetic resources, reef fish also constitute experimental models that allow the discrimination of ecological, developmental, and evolutionary processes at work. Here, we emphasize how the study of color patterns in reef fish can be integrated in an Eco/Evo/Devo (ecological evolutionary developmental) perspective and we illustrate that such an approach can bring new insights on the evolution of complex phenotypes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mimicry is very common for insects, displayed in various stages of eggs, nymphs, larvae, pupae or adults. Since eye-to-eye has a powerful impact on vertebrates, eyespots become an important anti-predation strategy for diurnal insects and other animals. In today's ecosystems, eyespots are still one of important self-defense methods for insects, especially for extant Lepidoptera. There are many documented examples of camouflage by various fossil insects of Odonata, Orthoptera, Homoptera, Neuroptera and Mecoptera from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota and the Middle Jurassic Yanliao Biota in the Northeastern China. Some fossil insects have dark spots and markings with various sizes irregularly distributed on their wings. A typical mimicry system comprises three parties: mimic, model and dupe. To ensure that mimicry occurs, all three parties should, to some extent, co-exist in the same living ecosystem at the same time. © 2019 JohnWiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that some eyespots of prey divert the strikes of predators, increasing the likelihood of prey escape. However, little is known about what makes eyespots effective divertive (deflective) prey marks. The size of eyespots varies much both between and even within taxa. Yet, whether size is important for the divertive function of eyespots is unknown. Furthermore, eyespots have often been described as highly contrasting, but the effects of contrast on the divertive function of eyespots has never been tested experimentally. Using artificial prey and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model for predator cognition and behavior, we tested the importance of size as well as internal contrast for the divertive effect of eyespots. We independently increased the internal contrast and size of eyespots and found that both increased the divertive effect. The effect of size was significant over all 4 subsequent prey presentations, whereas the effect of contrast decreased after the initial presentations. These results suggest that the size and contrast of divertive marks are probably shaped by selection imposed by predation. We also discuss the involvement of predation in the seasonal and ontogenic plasticity of eyespots found in some taxa. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - It has been suggested that structural ultraviolet (UV) patches on the wings of butterflies play a role in sexual selection. UV patches may be condition-dependent signals of mate quality. In the current study, we investigated associations between the morphological properties of two male wing patterns (one signalling and one non-signalling trait) and between these patterns and various environmental variables in seven species of the genus Gonepteryx (G. rhamni, G. nepalensis, G. maxima, G. amintha, G. aspasia, G. niphonica and G. cleopatra). We collected UV photographs of a total of 320 male specimens and analysed them using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that the shape of UV patches (a signalling trait) is more asymmetric than the wing venation (a non-signalling trait). In both examined traits, however, relationship between the environment and fluctuating asymmetry is significant only in a minority of species. Our results thus do not support the hypothesis that fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable indicator of an individual’s quality, in other words, that UV patches are condition-dependent trait. Examination of correlations between the two investigated shapes and the environment yielded similar results, and while the shape of UV patterns tended to be more strongly associated with the environment than the venation patterns, the correlation reached a level of significance only in a minority of cases. Due to the ambiguity of our findings, we cannot corroborate the hypothesis that UV patches act as biological signals of male quality in Gonepteryx butterflies, which is the case in various other related butterfly species. Finally, we found that UV patches discriminate among various Gonepteryx species better than the venation patterns do, which indicates that UV patches play a role in species recognition. It also suggests that UV patterns could be a useful taxonomic trait. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - During animal contests over resources, opponents often signal their fighting ability in an attempt to avoid escalating to physical attack. A reliable signal is beneficial to receivers because it allows them to avoid injuries from engaging in contests they are unlikely to win. However, a signaler could benefit from deceiving an opponent by signaling greater fighting ability or greater aggressive intent than the signaler possesses. Therefore, the reliability of agonistic signals has long intrigued researchers. We investigated whether a colored patch, the meral spot, signals weapon performance in the stomatopod Neogonodactylus oerstedii. During fights over possession of refuges, stomatopods can injure or even kill opponents with their ultrafast strike. We found that darker meral spots correlate with higher strike impulse, which reflects the total force integrated over time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stomatopods that strike more often with both appendages have darker meral spots and that the first hit in a two-appendage strike has a greater mean strike impulse than that of a single-appendage strike. This indicates that stomatopods with darker meral spots tend to invest more energy in each strike. Our results provide evidence that stomatopods use total reflectance as an honest signal of weapon performance or aggressive intent. This improves our understanding of the evolution of agonistic signals. © 2018 The University of Chicago.

AB  - While the most obvious use of coloration as an antipredatory defense is in camouflage, here we focus on other uses. Many chemically defended prey advertise these defenses with bright color signals (such as the yellow-and-black striped pattern of many wasps). Such aposematic signals aid predators in learning to avoid attacking such defended species. Mimicry occurs when two species share the same aposematic signal, and the signal similarity may benefit one or both species. Coloration may also influence the predator’s point of attack on a prey’s body, or ‘startle’ a predator into aborting an attack. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Flying insects frequently experience wing damage during their life. Such irreversible alterations of wing shape affect flight performance and ultimately fitness. Insects have been shown to compensate for wing damage through various behavioural adjustments, but the importance of damage location over the wings has scarcely been studied. Using natural variation in wing damage, we tested how the loss of different wing parts affects flight performance. We quantified flight performance in two species of large butterflies, Morpho helenor and Morpho achilles, caught in the wild and displaying large variation in the extent and location of wing damage. We artificially generated more severe wing damage in our sample to contrast natural versus higher magnitude wing loss. Wing shape alteration across our sample was quantified using geometric morphometrics to test the effect of different damage distributions on flight performance. Our results show that impaired flight performance clearly depends on damage location over the wings, pointing to a relative importance of different wing parts for flight. A deteriorated forewing leading edge most critically affected flight performance, specifically decreasing flight speed and the proportion of gliding flight. In contrast, the most frequent natural damage, deteriorated wing margin, had no detectable effect on flight behaviour. Damage located on the hindwings – although having a limited effect on flight – was associated with reduced flight height, suggesting that the forewings and hindwings play different roles in butterfly flight. By contrasting harmless and deleterious consequences of various types of wing damage, our study highlights different selective regimes acting on morphological variations of butterfly wings. © 2019.

AB  - Butterflies often use their dorsal and ventral wing color patterns for distinct signaling functions. Color patterns on hidden dorsal wing surfaces are often used in sexual signaling, while exposed ventral patterns are often used to ward off predator attacks. At rest, however, part of the ventral forewings are often hidden by the hindwings, allowing individuals to also use the patterns on this wing surface for sexual signaling. Here, we test this hypothesis in Bicyclus anynana (Butler, Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) butterflies by first determining the degree of sexual dimorphism in ventral forewing patterns, focusing on the eyespots, from both wet and dry season forms, and then testing the role of the larger ventral forewing eyespots of dry season females in male mate choice. We also test male investment in reproduction. We show that ventral forewing UV-reflective eyespot centers, in addition to dorsal forewing eyespot centers previously examined in this species, play a role in sexual signaling as males preferentially mated with females with their ventral eyespot centers intact instead of blocked with black paint. This male preference, however, did not translate into a detectable higher reproductive investment via a single mating toward ornamented females. This study provides an example of how ventral forewing patterns, often hidden by hindwings, are used in sexual communication, in this case by females to attract males. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Butterfly wing ocelli (spots) are argued to have adaptive functions (anti-predator, mate enhancement). However, little attention has been given to differences between individual spots, sexes and populations. Hipparchia semele is a lateral basker, rarely opening its wings when settled other than during courtship. This provides a potential for uncoupling the functions of ventral and dorsal ocelli. Data from 725 specimens belonging to 12 North Wales populations are used to examine the consistency in wing spots in relationship to wing expanse, sexes and biotopes. Given that predators tend to prefer heavier, larger and slower prey, spot size should increase at a faster rate than wing expanse and should be larger in females. Spot size should also reflect sex differences in behaviour, resource use and vulnerability to predators, in addition to sexual selection. Given that females expose the dorsal wings during courtship, the forewing dorsal wing spots should be larger than the forewing ventral wing spots, and the forewing anal spot should act as a more prominent signal than the apical spot compared with males. These observations are supported by this study. The results are discussed in relationship to strategies (crypsis and active defence) to combat predation and for sexual selection. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Understanding how morphological structures are built is essential for appreciating the morphological complexity and divergence of organisms. One representative case of morphological structures is the camouflage and mimicry of butterfly wing patterns. Some previous studies have questioned whether camouflage and mimicry are truly structures, considering that they rely on coloration. Nevertheless, our recent study revealed that the leaf pattern of Kallima inachus butterfly wings evolved through the combination of changes in several pigment components in a block-wise manner; it remains unclear whether such block-wise structures are common in other cases of camouflage and mimicry in butterflies and how they come about. Previous studies focused solely on a set of homologous components, termed the nymphalid ground plan. In the present study, we extended the scope of the description of components by including not only the nymphalid ground plan but also other common components (i.e., ripple patterns, dependent patterns, and color fields). This extension allowed us to analyze the combinatorial building logic of structures and examine multicomponent structures of camouflage and mimicry in butterfly wing patterns. We investigated various patterns of camouflage and mimicry (e.g., masquerade, crypsis, Müllerian mimicry, Batesian mimicry) in nine species and decomposed them into an assembly of multiple components. These structural component analyses suggested that camouflage and mimicry in butterfly wing patterns are built up by combining multiple types of components. We also investigated associations between components and the kinds of camouflage and mimicry. Several components are statistically more often used to produce specific types of camouflage or mimicry. Thus, our work provides empirical evidence that camouflage and mimicry patterns of butterfly wings are mosaic structures, opening up a new avenue of studying camouflage, and mimicry from a structural perspective. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A characteristic feature of the giant owl butterfly, i.e. Caligo memnon, is its big wing eyespot. This feature could serve as deceiving functionality for the butterfly against predators. As evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) image on black part of eyespot, the scales on wing eyespot contain nanostructured ridges and cross-ribs. Applying direct measurement, statistical method, and Fourier analysis, the authors evidence that these nanostructures display order-disorder in their shape and position. The autocorrelation of SEM image provides average values of characteristic periods of the order-disorder nanostructures together with an estimation of corresponding correlation lengths. Linecuts obtained from the Fourier transform of SEM image were also analysed with the Hosemann function to extract similar information. These analyses indicate that the nanostructured order-disorder may contribute to blackness on wing eyespot. The authors thus conclude that the blackness on wing eyespot of C. memnon could be attributed to contributions from both the nanostructured order-disorder and melanin pigment. © 2018 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Research on evolutionary forces determining optimal body sizes has primarily relied on experimental evaluation of respective selective pressures. Accounting for among-species variation through application of phylogenetic comparative methods is a complementary although little used approach. It enables the direct association of body size values with particular environments. Using phylogenetically explicit comparative analyses, we show that small body size is associated with diurnal (rather than nocturnal) activity of adults among temperate species of the moth family Geometridae. The association of an exclusively adult trait with species-specific body size suggests that optimal body sizes are at least partly determined by the costs being a large adult, as opposed to the more frequently considered costs of attaining large size. It appears likely that size-selective predation by insectivorous birds is the primary factor responsible for selection against large body size in day-flying moths. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Prey transmit sensory illusions to redirect predatory strikes, creating a discrepancy between what a predator perceives and reality. We use the acoustic arms race between bats and moths to investigate the evolution and function of a sensory illusion. The spinning hindwing tails of silk moths (Saturniidae) divert bat attack by reflecting sonar to create a misleading echoic target. We characterized geometric morphometrics of moth hindwings across silk moths, mapped these traits onto a new, robust phylogeny, and found that elaborated hindwing structures have converged on four adaptive shape peaks. To test the mechanism underlying these anti-bat traits, we pit bats against three species of silk moths with experimentally altered hindwings that created a representative gradient of ancestral and extant hindwing shapes. High-speed videography of battles reveals that moths with longer hindwings and tails more successfully divert bat attack. We postulate that sensory illusions are widespread and are underappreciated drivers of diversity across systems. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Both constitutive and inducible antipredator strategies are ubiquitous in nature and serve to maximize fitness under a predation threat. Inducible strategies may be favored over constitutive defenses depending on their relative cost and benefit and temporal variability in predator presence. In African temporary ponds, annual killifish of the genus Nothobranchius are variably exposed to predators, depending on whether larger fish invade their habitat from nearby rivers during floods. Nonetheless, potential plastic responses to predation risk are poorly known. Here, we studied whether Nothobranchius furzeri individuals adjust their life history in response to a predation threat. For this, we monitored key life history traits in response to cues that signal the presence of predatory pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). While growth rate, adult body size, age at maturation, and initial fecundity were not affected, peak and total fecundity were higher in the predation risk treatment. This contrasts with known life history strategies of killifish from permanent waters, which tend to reduce reproduction in the presence of predators. Although our results show that N. furzeri individuals are able to detect predators and respond to their presence by modulating their reproductive output, these responses only become evident after a few clutches have been deposited. Overall our findings suggest that, in the presence of a predation risk, it can be beneficial to increase the production of life stages that can persist until the predation risk has faded. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The bivoltine European map butterfly (Araschnia levana) displays seasonal polyphenism characterized by the formation of two remarkably distinct dorsal wing phenotypes: The spring generation (A. levana levana) is predominantly orange with black spots and develops from diapause pupae, whereas the summer generation (A. levana prorsa) has black, white, and orange bands and develops from subitaneous pupae. The choice between spring or summer imagoes is regulated by the photoperiod during larval and prepupal development, but polyphenism in the larvae has not been investigated before. Recently, it has been found that the prepupae of A. levana display differences in immunity-related gene expression, so we tested whether larvae destined to become spring (short-day) or summer (long-day) morphs also display differences in innate immunity. We measured larval survival following the injection of a bacterial entomopathogen (Pseudomonas entomophila), the antimicrobial activity in their hemolymph and the induced expression of selected genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Larvae of the short-day generation died significantly later, exhibited higher antibacterial activity in the hemolymph, and displayed higher induced expression levels of AMPs than those of the long-day generation. Our study expands the seasonal polyphenism of A. levana beyond the morphologically distinct spring and summer imagoes to include immunological larval polyphenism that reveals the photoperiodic modulation of immunity. This may reflect life-history traits that manifest as trade-offs between immunity and fecundity. © 2018 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mortality through predation is often selective, particularly at life-history bottlenecks. While many studies have looked at the importance for survival of specific prey characteristics in isolation, few have looked at a broad array of attributes and how they relate to survival in a realistic context. Our study measures 18 morphological, performance and behavioural traits of a juvenile damselfish that have been hypothesized as important for prey survival, and examines how they relate to survival in the field immediately after settlement. These attributes included size, relative false eye-spot size, fast-start escape response kinematics, thigmotaxis, laterality, and space use and activity in the field. Using conditional inference trees, we identify the most important drivers out of a reduced suite of 13 characters. Fast-start response latency, boldness, feeding rates and two measures of activity were found to significantly contribute to survival. Morphological variables and most laboratory measures of performance appeared to contribute little to survival. Results suggest selection works on a suite of characters associated with boldness. Bold and active fish are those that will be best able to learn using public information, but because of the relative naiveté of newly metamorphosed fishes, speed to react to a strike from an unknown predator is of critical importance. Findings substantiate the ecomorphological paradigm by suggesting that selection on behaviour modifies the correlations of morphological and performance variables with survival probabilities, since behaviour modifies performance capabilities by making them specific to context.

AB  - Deflection occurs in predator-prey interactions where prey possess traits that influence the position of the predator's initial contact with the prey's body in a way that enhances the prey's probability of survival when attacked. As an anti-predatory defence occurring late in the sequence of an attack, deflection is an understudied but fascinating strategy that involves a range of unusual adaptations in diverse prey species. Deflective traits have been postulated to be important to the defensive strategies of a range of organisms, but although evidence for their existence is variable among groups, we argue that previous research neglects some promising taxa. As a defence, deflection will probably play a crucial role in the behavioural ecology and evolution of both prey species and their predators; as such, it warrants greater interest from zoologists. Here, we first summarize what is known about deflection from the current literature. We next offer predictions about the co-evolutionary possibilities surrounding deflection, based on the benefits and costs experienced by prey and their predators. Finally, we outline the most interesting outstanding avenues for future research in the field of deflection and make new suggestions as to how they could be explored usefully. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB  - Light is arguably the most important abiotic factor for living organisms. Organisms evolved under specific lighting conditions and their behavior, physiology, and ecology are inexorably linked to light. Understanding light effects on biology could not be more important as present anthropogenic effects are greatly changing the light environments in which animals exist. The two biggest anthropogenic contributors changing light environments are: (1) anthropogenic lighting at night (i.e., light pollution); and (2) deforestation and the built environment. I highlight light importance for butterfly behavior, physiology, and ecology and stress the importance of including light as a conservation factor for conserving butterfly biodiversity. This review focuses on four parts: (1) Introducing the nature and extent of light. (2) Visual and non-visual light reception in butterflies. (3) Implications of unnatural lighting for butterflies across several different behavioral and ecological contexts. (4). Future directions for quantifying the threat of unnatural lighting on butterflies and simple approaches to mitigate unnatural light impacts on butterflies. I urge future research to include light as a factor and end with the hopeful thought that controlling many unnatural light conditions is simply done by flipping a switch. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - With their large brains, elaborate sense organs and complex behaviour, cephalopods are among the world's most highly evolved invertebrates. This second edition summarises the wealth of exciting new research data stemming from over five hundred papers published since the first volume appeared. It adopts a comparative approach to causation, function, development and evolution as it explores cephalopod behaviour in natural habitats and the laboratory. Extensive colour and black-and-white photography illustrates various aspects of cephalopod behaviour to complement the scientific analysis. Covering the major octopus, squid and cuttlefish species, as well as the shelled Nautilus, this is an essential resource for undergraduate and advanced students of animal behaviour, as well as researchers new to cephalopods, in fields such as neuroscience and conservation biology. By highlighting the gaps in current knowledge, the text looks to inform and to stimulate further study of these enigmatic and beautiful animals. © Roger T. Hanlon and John B. Messenger 2018.

AB  - Edges are salient visual cues created by abrupt changes in luminance and color and are crucial in perceptual tasks such as motion detection and object recognition. Disruptively colored animals exploit edge detection mechanisms to obscure their body outline and/ or to conceal themselves against their background. Conversely, aposematic species may use contrasting patterns with well-defined edges to create highly salient, memorable warning signals. In this study, we investigated how the amount of internal pattern edge, colored area, pattern type, or shape repetition of warning signals influenced avoidance learning in the triggerfish, Rhinecanthus aculeatus. Using 6 different warning signals, we found that fish learnt to avoid aposematic signals faster when they featured more internal pattern edge. We found little evidence that the amount of colored area or pattern type affected learning rates. An optimal amount of pattern edge within a warning signal may therefore improve how warning signals are learnt. These findings offer important insights into the evolution of prey warning signal evolution and predator psychology. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Behavior studies now span a variety of sub-disciplines, including behavioral ecology, neuroscience, cognitive psychology and evolutionary developmental biology. While the fields' rapid growth has led to startling new insights into animal behavior, it has brought increasingly fragmented approaches to the subject. Integrating ideas and findings from a range of disciplines, this book provides a common framework for understanding diverse issues in behavior studies. The framework is derived from classical ethology, incorporating concepts and data from research in experimental psychology, neurophysiology and evolutionary biology. Hogan outlines the origin and development of major ideas and issues in the field, drawing on examples throughout to highlight connections across sub-disciplines. Demonstrating how results in one area can directly inform work in others, the book ultimately proposes concepts to facilitate new discussions that will open the way for improved dialog between researchers across behavior studies. © Jerry A.

AB  - Background: One hypothesis surrounding the origin of novel traits is that they originate from the co-option of pre-existing genes or larger gene regulatory networks into novel developmental contexts. Insights into a trait's evolutionary origins can, thus, be gained via identification of the genes underlying trait development, and exploring whether those genes also function in other developmental contexts. Here we investigate the set of genes associated with the development of eyespot color patterns, a trait that originated once within the Nymphalid family of butterflies. Although several genes associated with eyespot development have been identified, the eyespot gene regulatory network remains largely unknown. Results: In this study, next-generation sequencing and transcriptome analyses were used to identify a large set of genes associated with eyespot development of Bicyclus anynana butterflies, at 3-6 h after pupation, prior to the differentiation of the color rings. Eyespot-associated genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of homologous micro-dissected wing tissues that either develop or do not develop eyespots in wild-type and a mutant line of butterflies, Spotty, with extra eyespots. Overall, 186 genes were significantly up and down-regulated in wing tissues that develop eyespots compared to wing tissues that do not. Many of the differentially expressed genes have yet to be annotated. New signaling pathways, including the Toll, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and/or Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways are associated for the first time with eyespot development. In addition, several genes involved in wound healing and calcium signaling were also found to be associated with eyespots. Conclusions: Overall, this study provides the identity of many new genes and signaling pathways associated with eyespots, and suggests that the ancient wound healing gene regulatory network may have been co-opted to cells at the center of the pattern to aid in eyespot origins. New transcription factors that may be providing different identities to distinct wing sectors, and genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the eyespots were also identified. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Eyespots of some prey are known to deter predators, but the reason for this response has not yet been established, and thus the taxonomically widespread occurrence of this color pattern has remained an evolutionary conundrum. Two alternative hypotheses propose that (1) the eyelike appearance of the pattern falsely indicates the presence of the predator’s own enemy or (2) predators are hardwired to be cautious toward conspicuous prey. Earlier research has pertained mainly to eyespots in butterflies. Here we tested the hypothesis that eyespots resemble eyes by utilizing the lateral position of eyes in fishes. This allowed us to produce eyelike displays that did not have the round appearance of eyespots. Our study indicates that eye mimicry is an important factor evoking hesitation in predators. Moreover, we present direct evidence that this is because predators associate eyelike displays with the threat posed by their own enemies. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Eyespot patterns of nymphalid butterflies are an example of a novel trait yet, the developmental origin of eyespots is still not well understood. Several genes have been associated with eyespot development but few have been tested for function. One of these genes is the signaling ligand, wingless, which is expressed in the eyespot centers during early pupation and may function in eyespot signaling and color ring differentiation. Here we tested the function of wingless in wing and eyespot development by down-regulating it in transgenic Bicyclus anynana butterflies via RNAi driven by an inducible heat-shock promoter. Heat-shocks applied during larval and early pupal development led to significant decreases in wingless mRNA levels and to decreases in eyespot size and wing size in adult butterflies. We conclude that wingless is a positive regulator of eyespot and wing development in B. anynana butterflies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Based on the most recent nymphalid phylogeny, the Satyrinae can be tentatively organized into the species-rich tribe Satyrini plus a clade that includes the Morphini, Brassolini, Haeterini, Elymniini, Melanitini, Dirini, Zetherini, and Amathusiini. Members of the latter eight tribes have the largest body sizes within Satyrinae and also show extraordinary wing pattern variation. Representatives of these tribes are illustrated herein, and pattern elements of the nymphalid ground plan are identified. Five themes are briefly discussed in light of their pattern diversification: (1) central symmetry system dislocations, (2) variation in ventral hind wing ocelli, (3) the color band between elements f and g, (4) sexual dimorphism and mimicry, and (5) transparency. Within an ecological and evolutionary standpoint, selected genera are provided as examples to explore wing patterns involved in male mating displays, camouflage, and mimicry. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The brachelytrous galerucine genus Shairella Chûjô is reviewed based on examination of 240 specimens. Five new species are described: S. cheni sp. nov., S. chungi sp. nov., S. guoi sp. nov., S. motienensis sp. nov., and S. tsoui sp. nov. The diversity and distribution of most of Shairella species are reflected on one major host plant-Clinopodium laxiflorum var. taiwanianum. Smaller compound eyes relative to otherwise similar galerucines are characteristic for Shairella and may be related to nocturnal behavior. The occurrence of a subapical white band on the antenna and its possible function is discussed. © 2017 Magnolia Press.

AB  - Predator mimicry occurs when prey resemble their predator to gain protection. We explored the relative importance of the morphological and locomotor signals that spider-mimicking moths use to deceive their jumping spider predators. Two hypotheses explain why animals use multicomponent signals for communication: the ‘back-up signal’ hypothesis which suggests that multiple traits increase accuracy, and the ‘multiple message’ hypothesis which suggests that the different traits serve different purposes or target different signal receivers. We conducted predation tests using the putative spider-mimicking moths Brenthia coronigera (visual and locomotor mimicry) and Choreutis hyligenes (only locomotor mimicry) and a control moth species displaying no mimicry. We found that B. coronigera used multicomponent signals, i.e. pattern, display posture and jumping behaviour, to deceive its jumping spider predators, and thus experienced lower predation rates and more time for escaping. Spiders suffered a decreased predation rate when they encountered B. coronigera, relative to the other two moth species. Spiders displayed leg-waving behaviour (which is used in courtship and territorial display) to both live and lure B. coronigera, suggesting that the spiders considered the moths to be another jumping spider. When the eyespots of B. coronigera were erased, the predation rate increased. In addition, the latency of first attacks was significantly longer in live B. coronigera moths than in lures fixed in the display posture. This suggests that the eyespots, the ‘peacock-like’ display position and the jumping movement all add to the similarity with jumping spiders. Our results support the ‘back-up signal’ hypothesis: that multiple signals can deceive the predators better. Our experimental paradigm enabled us to explore the recognition ability of predators, and gave insight into the ways evolution shapes the mimicry system. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - Background: Most animal eyes feature an opaque pigmented eyecup to assure that light can enter from one direction only. We challenge this dogma by describing a previously unknown form of eyeshine resulting from light that enters the eye through the top of the head and optic nerve, eventually emanating through the pupil as a narrow beam: the Optic-Nerve-Transmitted (ONT) eyeshine. We characterize ONT eyeshine in the triplefin blenny Tripterygion delaisi (Tripterygiidae) in comparison to three other teleost species, using behavioural and anatomical observations, spectrophotometry, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging. The study's aim is to identify the factors that determine ONT eyeshine occurrence and intensity, and whether these are specifically adapted for that purpose. Results: ONT eyeshine intensity benefits from locally reduced head pigmentation, a thin skull, the gap between eyes and forebrain, the potential light-guiding properties of the optic nerve, and, most importantly, a short distance between the head surface and the optic nerves. Conclusions: The generality of these factors and the lack of specifically adapted features implies that ONT eyeshine is widespread among small fish species. Nevertheless, its intensity varies considerably, depending on the specific combination and varying expression of common anatomical features. We discuss whether ONT eyeshine might affect visual performance, and speculate about possible functions such as predator detection, camouflage, and intraspecific communication. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The selection pressure from echolocating bats has driven the development of a diverse range of anti-bat strategies in insects. For instance, several studies have proposed that the wings of some moths absorb a large portion of the sound energy contained in a bat's ultrasonic cry; as a result, the bat receives a dampened echo, and the moth becomes invisible to the bat. To test the hypothesis that greater exposure to bat predation drives the development of higher ultrasound absorbance, we used a small reverberation chamber to measure the ultrasound absorbance of the wings of nocturnal (Bombycoidea: Saturniidae) and diurnal moths (Chalcosiinae: Zygaenoidea: Zygaenidae). The absorption factor of the nocturnal saturniids peaks significantly higher than the absorption factor of the diurnal chalcosiines. However, the wings of the chalcosiines absorb more ultrasound than the wings of some diurnal butterflies. Following a phylogenetic analysis on the character state of diurnality/ nocturnality in the Zygaenidae, we propose that diurnality in the Chalcosiinae is plesiomorphic (retained); hence, the absorbance of their wings is probably not a vestigial trait from an ancestral, nocturnal form but an adaptation to bat activity that overlaps their own. On a within-species level, females of the saturniids Argema mittrei and Samia cynthia ricini have significantly higher absorption factors than the males. In the female S. c. ricini, the higher absorption factor corresponds to a detection distance by bats that is at best 20-30% shorter than that of the male.

AB  - The Psychology of the Car explores automotive cultures through the lens of psychology with the goal of achieving a low-carbon transport future. Worldwide there are now more than one billion cars, and their number grows continuously. Yet there is growing evidence that humanity needs to reach 'peak cars' as increased air pollution, noise, accidents, and climate change support a decline in car usage. While many governments agree, the car remains attractive, and endeavors to change transport systems have faced fierce resistance. Based on insights from a wide range of transport behaviors, The Psychology of the Car shows the "why? of automotive cultures, providing new perspectives essential for understanding its attractiveness and for defining a more desirable transport future. The Psychology of the Car illustrates the growth of global car use over time and its effect on urban transport systems and the global environment. It looks at the adoption of the car into lifestyles, the "mobilities turn,? and how the car impacts collective and personal identities. The book examines car drivers themselves; their personalities, preferences, and personality disorders relevant to driving. The book looks at the role power, control, dominance, speed, and gender play, as well as the interrelationship between personal freedom and law enforcement. The book explores risk-taking behaviors as accidental death is a central element of car driving. The book addresses how interventions can be successful as well as which interventions are unlikely to work, and concludes with how a more sustainable transport future can be created based on emerging transport trends. Features deep analyses of individual and collective psychologies of car affection, moving beyond sociology-based interpretations of automobile culture. Illustrates concepts using popular culture examples that expose ideas about automobility. Shows how fewer, smaller and more environmentally friendly cars, as well as low-carbon transport modes, are more socially attractive. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The genus is separable from its closely related genera by the simultaneous occurrence in males of pectinate antenna, extremely reduced, lobate hindwings, and the tuft of elongate scales on the tip of the abdomen. The systematic position of the new genus within the tribe Syntomini is discussed on the basis of morphological characters. A key for the identification of the genera of African Thyretina bearing a pointed abdominal tuft is also provided.

AB  - Organisms frequently gain advantages when they engage in signalling with individuals of other species. Here, we provide a functionally structured framework of the great variety of interspecific visual signals seen in nature, and then describe the different signalling mechanisms that have evolved in response to each of these functional requirements. We propose that interspecific visual signalling can be divided into six major functional categories: anti-predator, food acquisition, anti-parasite, host acquisition, reproductive and agonistic signalling, with each function enabled by several distinct mechanisms.We support our classification by reviewing the ecological and behavioural drivers of interspecific signalling in animals and plants, principally focusing on comparative studies that address large-scale patterns of diversity. Collating diverse examples of interspecific signalling into an organized set of functional and mechanistic categories places anachronistic behavioural and morphological labels in fresh context, clarifies terminology and redirects research effort towards understanding environmental influences driving interspecific signalling in nature.

AB  - While plant mimicry by animals to make them cryptic from both prey and predators has received significant attention, the reverse situation, i.e. animal mimicry by plants as defense from herbivores, has been paid dramatically less. Here, in an essay intended to both stimulate and intrigue, I describe the various proposed types of defensive animal mimicry by plants, discuss the few published experimental tests of this hypothesis, and propose some future directions of research of defensive animal mimicry by plants. Animal mimicry by plants as defense from herbivores comprises two general types: Direct animal mimicry, and mimicry of cues about animal action. The direct type includes bee, wasp, caterpillar, ant, aphid, beetle, butterfly, eye, and snake mimicry. The animal cue mimicry includes tunneling, chewing damage, spider web or arthropod silk, animal dung-shaped plants, and carrion and dung odors. These defenses include Batesian mimicry, masquerade, a mixture of Batesian mimicry and masquerade, and probably also perceptual exploitation. As an overlooked phenomenon, this area of evolutionary ecology has good potential for interesting finds. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - The wings of insects are composed of membranes supported by interconnected veins. Within these veins are epithelial cells, nerves and tracheae, and their maintenance requires the flow of hemolymph. For this purpose, insects employ accessory pulsatile organs (auxiliary hearts) that circulate hemolymph throughout the wings. Here, we used correlative approaches to determine the functional mechanics of hemolymph circulation in the wings of themalariamosquito Anopheles gambiae. Examination of sectioned tissues and intravital videos showed that the wing heart is located underneath the scutellum and is separate from the dorsal vessel. It is composed of a single pulsatile diaphragm (indicating that it is unpaired) that contracts at 3 Hz and circulates hemolymph throughout both wings. The wing heart contracts significantly faster than the dorsal vessel, and there is no correlation between the contractions of these two pulsatile organs. The wing heart functions by aspirating hemolymph out of the posterior wing veins, which forces hemolymph into the wings via anterior veins. By tracking the movement of fluorescent microspheres, we show that the flow diameter of the wing circulatory circuit is less than 1 ?m, and we present a spatial map detailing the flow of hemolymph across all the wing veins, including the costa, sub-costa, ambient costa, radius, media, cubitus anterior, anal vein and crossveins. We also quantified the movement of hemolymph within the radius and within the ambient costa, and show that hemolymph velocity and maximum acceleration are higher when hemolymph is exiting the wing. © 2016 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Through dishonest signals or actions, individuals often misinform others to their own benefit. We review recent literature to explore the evolutionary and ecological conditions for deception to be more likely to evolve and be maintained. We identify four conditions: (1) high misinformation potential through perceptual constraints of perceiver; (2) costs and benefits of responding to deception; (3) asymmetric power relationships between individuals and (4) exploitation of common goods. We discuss behavioural and physiological mechanisms that form a deception continuum from secrecy to overt signals. Deceptive tactics usually succeed by being rare and are often evolving under co-evolutionary arms races, sometimes leading to the evolution of polymorphism. The degree of deception can also vary depending on the environmental conditions. Finally, we suggest a conceptual framework for studying deception and highlight important questions for future studies. © 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society

AB  - Individuals of many species are considered to rely on a single type of external appearance to escape predation but there are many notable exceptions. To develop an ecological framework to explain why some individuals employ different colour patterns as part of their defensive repertoire, we collate examples of colour change that are associated with living in different environments and microhabitats, examples of age-related colour change, colour defences tailored to different predators, and startle displays, where hidden conspicuous colour patterns are suddenly revealed. The over-arching commonality to all these examples is that the use of more than one defense-related external appearance is associated with a spatial or temporal change in predation risk. For example, coarse scale temporal changes in an animal’s background frequently select for gradual colour changes, while fine-scale spatial heterogeneity selects for more rapid colour changes and we provide a graphical framework for this. Irrespective of the mechanisms underlying colour change, using more than one colour defence appears driven by variation in predation risk rather than by idiosyncratic abilities to alter external appearances as is commonly believed, although physiological and energetic factors will play some role. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - It has long been postulated that the elongated hindwing tails of many saturniid moths have evolved to create false sonar targets to divert the attack of echolocation-guided bat predators. However, rigorous echo-acoustic evidence to support this hypothesis has been lacking. In this study, fluttering luna moths (Actias luna), a species with elongated hindwing tails, were ensonified with frequency modulated chirp signals from all angles of orientation and across the wingbeat cycle. High-speed stereo videography was combined with pulse compression sonar processing to characterize the echo information available to foraging bats. Contrary to previous suggestions, the results show that the tail echoes are weak and do not dominate the sonar returns, compared to the largelanar wings and the moth body. However, the distinctive twisted morphology of the tails create persistent echoes across all angles of orientation, which may induce erroneous sonar target localization and disrupt accurate tracking by echolocating bats. These findings thus suggest a refinement of the false target hypothesis to emphasize sonar localization errors induced by the twisted tails, and highlight the importance of physics-based approaches to study the sensory information involved in the evolutionary arms race between moths and their bat predators. © 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - This study investigated the spatial distribution of an Amazonian fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage by linking species taxonomic and functional approaches. We hypothesized that: 1) vegetation richness (i.e., resources) and abundance of insectivorous birds (i.e., predators) should drive changes in butterfly taxonomic composition, 2) larval diet breadth should decrease with increase of plant species richness, 3) small-sized adults should be favored by higher abundance of birds, and 4) communities with eyespot markings should be able to exploit areas with higher predation pressure. Fruit-feeding butterflies were sampled with bait traps and insect nets across 25 km 2 of an Amazonian ombrophilous forest in Brazil. We measured larval diet breadth, adult body size, and wing marking of all butterflies. Our results showed that plant species richness explained most of the variation in butterfly taxonomic turnover. Also, community average diet breadth decreased with increase of plant species richness, which supports our expectations. In contrast, community average body size increased with the abundance of birds, refuting our hypothesis. We detected no influence of environmental gradients on the occurrence of species with eyespot markings. The association between butterfly taxonomic and functional composition points to a mediator role of the functional traits in the environmental filtering of butterflies. The incorporation of the functional approach into the analyses allowed for the detection of relationships that were not observed using a strictly taxonomic perspective and provided an extra insight into comprehending the potential adaptive strategies of butterflies. © 2015 The Authors 2015.

AB  - Birds are able to recognize and learn to avoid attacking unpalatable, chemically defended butterflies after unpleasant experiences with them. It has also been suggested that birds learn to avoid prey that are efficient at escaping. This, however, remains poorly documented. Here, we argue that butterflies may utilize a variety of escape tactics against insectivorous birds and review evidence that birds avoid attacking butterflies that are hard to catch. We suggest that signaling difficulty of capture to predators is a widespread phenomenon in butterflies, and this ability may not be limited to palatable butterflies. The possibility that both palatable and unpalatable species signal difficulty of capture has not been fully explored, but helps explain the existence of aposematic coloration and escape mimicry in butterflies lacking defensive chemicals. This possibility may also change the role that putative Müllerian and Batesian mimics play in a variety of classical mimicry rings, thus opening new perspectives in the evolution of mimicry in butterflies. © 2016, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that exposure to cues of intentional agents in the form of eyes can increase prosocial behavior. However, previous research mostly used 2-dimensional depictions as experimental stimuli. Thus far no study has examined the influence of the spatial properties of agency cues on this prosocial effect. To investigate the role of dimensionality of agency cues on fairness, 345 participants engaged in a decisionmaking task in a naturalistic setting. The experimental treatment included a 3-dimensional pseudo-realistic model of a human head and a 2-dimensional picture of the same object. The control stimuli consisted of a real plant and its 2-D image. Our results partly support the findings of previous studies that cues of intentional agents increase prosocial behavior. However, this effect was only found for the 3-D cues, suggesting that dimensionality is a critical variable in triggering these effects in a real-world settings. Our research sheds light on a hitherto unexplored aspect of the effects of environmental cues and their morphological properties on decision-making. © 2016 Krátký et al.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots are known to function in predator deflection and predator intimidation, but it is still unclear what factors cause eyespots to serve one function over the other. Both functions have been demonstrated in different species that varied in eyespot size, eyespot number and wing size, leaving the contribution of each of these factors to butterfly survival unclear. Here, we study how each of these factors contributes to eyespot function by using paper butterfly models, where each factor is varied in turn, and exposing these models to predation in the field. We find that the presence of multiple, small eyespots results in high predation, whereas single large eyespots (larger than 6 mm in diameter) results in low predation. These data indicate that single large eyespots intimidate predators, whereas multiple small eyespots produce a conspicuous, but non-intimidating signal to predators. We propose that eyespots may gain an intimidation function by increasing in size. Our measurements of eyespot size in 255 nymphalid butterfly species show that large eyespots are relatively rare and occur predominantly on ventral wing surfaces. By mapping eyespot size on the phylogeny of the family Nymphalidae, we show that these large eyespots, with a potential intimidation function, are dispersed throughout multiple nymphalid lineages, indicating that phylogeny is not a strong predictor of eyespot size. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Coloration of animals often includes spectacular markings that supposedly decrease predation risk. Many vertebrates have eye stripes that have been suggested to conceal the noticeable shape of the eye from predators. Another salient mark in a wide range of taxa that sometimes co-occurs with an eye stripe is the eyespot. Some eyespots divert strikes of attacking predators, but whether the eyelike appearance is essential for the divertive effect is not known. Although numerous species of fish provide iconic examples of spectacular coloration, experimental studies on the protective function of coloration against fish predators are scarce. We investigated the divertive potential of prey marks, using artificial prey and three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, as a model for predator perception and behaviour. A significant proportion of attacking fish directed their strike towards an eyespot, but when compared to a square-shaped mark, the bias was not significantly stronger. Importantly, a stripe running through the eyelike mark strongly influenced the attacking fish. When presented simultaneously, the fish directed their strikes towards an intact eyelike shape and away from an eyelike shape disrupted by a stripe. Our results demonstrate that marks of different shapes differ in their divertive potential, and this may contribute to the wide occurrence of eyespots in prey. Importantly, they also show that a stripe can effectively decrease the salience of an eyelike pattern, which provides the first experimental evidence for the adaptive benefit for eye stripes. Moreover, the joint effect of the eyespot and the disruptive eye stripe indicates that prey marks with different functions can form adaptive constellations to manipulate the attack behaviour of predators. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Alike the little mouse of the Gruffalo’s tale, many harmless preys use intimidating deceptive signals as anti-predator strategies. For example, several caterpillars display eyespots and face-like colour patterns that are thought to mimic the face of snakes as deterrents to insectivorous birds. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the hypothesis that these defensive strategies exploit adaptive cognitive biases of birds, which make them much more likely to confound caterpillars with snakes than vice versa. By focusing on the information- processing mechanisms of decision-making, the model assumes that, during prey assessment, the bird accumulates noisy evidence supporting either the snake-escape or the caterpillar-attack motor responses, which compete against each other for execution. Competition terminates when the evidence for either one of the responses reaches a critical threshold. This model predicts a strong asymmetry and a strong negative correlation between the prey- and the predator-decision thresholds, which increase with the increasing risk of snake predation and assessment uncertainty. The threshold asymmetry causes an asymmetric distribution of false-negative and false-positive errors in the snake–caterpillar decision plane, which makes birds much more likely to be deceived by the intimidating signals of snake-mimicking caterpillars than by the alluring signals of caterpillar-mimicking snakes. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Behavioural lateralization - the preferential use of one side of the body or either of the bilateral organs or limbs - has been well documented in many species, in a number of contexts. While the benefits reported are numerous, existing latent variability in the degree of lateralization within and across populations, species and taxa indicates that existing costs may modulate its expression. Few studies have reported changes in the degree of lateralization at the individual level, in response to long-term changes in environmental conditions, but not in response to short-term changes in environmental conditions. Predation is highly variable both temporally and spatially and hence is a good candidate for testing lateralization effects based on short-term changes in environmental conditions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the degree of behavioural lateralization changes following short-term exposure to different levels of risk. We tested whether wild-caught juvenile damselfish exposed to a high or low background level of risk for 4 days would subsequently differ in their turning bias, a trait that has been linked to predator escape behaviour in fishes. We found that 4 days is enough to induce a difference in the absolute lateralization scores of the fish, with high-risk fish being more strongly lateralized than low-risk fish. Practically, this difference stemmed from decreasing lateralization scores for newly recruiting coral reef fishes that were kept in low-risk environments, with the concurrent maintenance of higher lateralization scores for fish maintained under high-risk conditions. Fish from the high-risk background had higher survival than those from the low-risk background upon release into mesocosms containing reef predators. Our study highlights how early exposure to differential predation risk affects the degree of behavioural lateralization. Given the profound effects of lateralization on many aspects of an animal's life from its ability to discriminate conspecifics to how it forages and interacts during agonistic interactions, predation risk may be a key driver of animal development. © 2015 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions. © 2015 Manesi et al.

AB  - Unsolved Problem The development of eyespots on the wing surface of butterflies of the family Nympalidae is one of the most studied examples of biological pattern formation.However, little is known about the mechanism that determines the number and precise locations of eyespots on the wing. Eyespots develop around signaling centers, called foci, that are located equidistant from wing veins along the midline of a wing cell (an area bounded by veins). A fundamental question that remains unsolved is, why a certain wing cell develops an eyespot, while other wing cells do not. Key Idea and Model We illustrate that the key to understanding focus point selection may be in the venation system of the wing disc. Our main hypothesis is that changes in morphogen concentration along the proximal boundary veins of wing cells govern focus point selection. Based on previous studies, we focus on a spatially two-dimensional reaction-diffusion system model posed in the interior of each wing cell that describes the formation of focus points. Using finite element based numerical simulations, we demonstrate that variation in the proximal boundary condition is sufficient to robustly select whether an eyespot focus point forms in otherwise identical wing cells. We also illustrate that this behavior is robust to small perturbations in the parameters and geometry and moderate levels of noise. Hence, we suggest that an anterior-posterior pattern of morphogen concentration along the proximal vein may be the main determinant of the distribution of focus points on the wing surface. In order to complete our model, we propose a two stage reaction-diffusion system model, in which an one-dimensional surface reaction-diffusion system, posed on the proximal vein, generates the morphogen concentrations that act as non-homogeneous Dirichlet (i.e., fixed) boundary conditions for the two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model posed in the wing cells. The two-stage model appears capable of generating focus point distributions observed in nature. Result We therefore conclude that changes in the proximal boundary conditions are sufficient to explain the empirically observed distribution of eyespot focus points on the entire wing surface. The model predicts, subject to experimental verification, that the source strength of the activator at the proximal boundary should be lower in wing cells in which focus points form than in those that lack focus points. The model suggests that the number and locations of eyespot foci on the wing disc could be largely controlled by two kinds of gradients along two different directions, that is, the first one is the gradient in spatially varying parameters such as the reaction rate along the anterior-posterior direction on the proximal boundary of the wing cells, and the second one is the gradient in source values of the activator along the veins in the proximal-distal direction of the wing cell. © 2015 Sekimura et al.

AB  - Ocelli are serially repeated colour patterns on the wings of many butterflies. Eyespots are elaborate ocelli that function in predator avoidance and deterrence as well as in mate choice. A phylogenetic approach was used to study ocelli and eyespot evolution in Vanessa butterflies, a genus exhibiting diverse phenotypes among these serial homologs. Forty-four morphological characters based on eyespot number, arrangement, shape and the number of elements in each eyespot were defined and scored. Ocelli from eight wing cells on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the forewing and hindwing were evaluated. The evolution of these characters was traced over a phylogeny of Vanessa based on 7750 DNA base pairs from 10 genes. Our reconstruction predicts that the ancestral Vanessa had 5 serially arranged ocelli on all four wing surfaces. The ancestral state on the dorsal forewing and ventral hindwing was ocelli arranged in two heterogeneous groups. On the dorsal hindwing, the ancestral state was either homogenous or ocelli arranged in two heterogeneous groups. On the ventral forewing, we determined that the ancestral state was organized into three heterogeneous groups. In Vanessa, almost all ocelli are individuated and capable of independent evolution relative to other colour patterns except for the ocelli in cells -1 and 0 on the dorsal and ventral forewings, which appear to be constrained to evolve in parallel. The genus Vanessa is a good model system for the study of serial homology and the interaction of selective forces with developmental architecture to produce diversity in butterfly colour patterns. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Nocturnal animals frequently possess seemingly conspicuous colour patterns that can function in a variety of ways (e.g. prey attraction, camouflage, predator avoidance, etc.). The use of colour patterns in intraspecific signalling, especially reproductive activities, in nocturnal animals has received relatively little attention. This study tested for a dual function of colour in the nocturnal fishing spider, Dolomedes raptor (Araneae: Pisauridae), whose males develop dimorphic white stripes at sexual maturation. We tested for a role in foraging as well as mate assessment. First, quantifications of the natural variation of male stripes indicated a correlation between stripe area and male body size and weight. Subsequent diet experiments confirmed that the area of a male's white stripes are body size-dependent and thus could potentially convey information to choosey females about male quality. Field experiments used dummies resembling D.raptor in appearance to test a prey attraction function of the white stripes. We found that dummies with the white stripes present attracted significantly more prey than those without stripes. Finally, we used males with manipulated phenotypes in laboratory mating trials and found that males with intact white stripes were significantly more likely to be accepted by females than those with the white stripes eliminated. Together, our results document a nutrient-dependent trait that functions not only in strengthening foraging success, but also in a mating context, increasing male mating success. We suggest that the role of these male white stripes in reproduction has been facilitated by their function in foraging. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Circular markings, called eyespots, on the wings of Lepidoptera have been shown to be protective against predators. We tested the 'conspicuousness-hypothesis' and 'eye mimicry-hypothesis' by examining how 'sparkle' and colour pattern of eyespots deter predators. The rationale was to test the deterring effect of shape and colour pattern of the eyespots' elements that are assumed to mimic lens eyes, namely iris, pupil, and sparkle by simultaneous exposure of lepidopteran dummies with equally conspicuous eyespots that differed in their similarity to lens eyes. The results provide evidence that circular and crescent-shaped 'sparkles' were more deterring than rectangular-shaped 'sparkles'. The 'sparkle's' UV-reflection had no effect on the deterrence. Our results support recent findings on the deterrent effect of the eyespot's 'sparkle' and show that colour is less important for deterrence. The characteristic colour pattern of eyespots and illusion of three-dimensionality created by the 'sparkle' might contribute to the deterrent effect. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.

AB  - Many prey species exhibit defensive traits to decrease their chances of predation. Conspicuous eye-spots, concentric rings of contrasting colours, are one type of defensive trait that some species exhibit to deter predators. We examined the function of eye-spots in Lepidoptera to determine whether they are effective at deterring predators because they resemble eyes (‘eye mimicry hypothesis’) or are highly salient (‘conspicuous signal hypothesis’). We recorded the gaze behaviour of men and women as they viewed natural images of butterflies and moths as well as images in which the eye-spots of these insects were modified. The eye-spots were modified by removing them, scrambling their colours, or replacing them with elliptical or triangular shapes that had either dark or light centres. Participants were generally more likely to look at, spend more time looking at and be faster to first fixate the eyespots of butterflies and moths that were natural compared with ones that were modified, including the elliptical eyespots with dark centres that most resembled eyes as well as the scrambled eye-spots that had the same contrast as the natural eye-spots. Participants were most likely to look at eye-spots that were numerous, had a large surface area and were located close to the insects’ heads. Participants’ pupils were larger when viewing eye-spots compared with the rest of the insects’ body, suggesting a greater arousal when viewing eye-spots. Our results provide some support for the conspicuous signal hypothesis (and minimal support for the eye mimicry hypothesis) and suggest that eye-spots may be effective at deterring predators because they are highly conspicuous signals that draw attention. ©2015 The Authors.

AB  - Many caterpillars have conspicuous eye-like markings, called eyespots. Despite recent work demonstrating the efficacy of eyespots in deterring predator attack, a fundamental question remains: Given their protective benefits, why have eyespots not evolved in more caterpillars? Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars, we show that eyespots are associated with large body size. This relationship could arise because (i) large prey are innately conspicuous; (ii) large prey are more profitable, and thus face stronger selection to evolve such defenses; and/or (iii) eyespots are more effective on large-bodied prey. To evaluate these hypotheses, we exposed small and large caterpillar models with and without eyespots in a 2 x 2 factorial design to avian predators in the field. Overall, eyespots increased prey mortality, but the effect was particularly marked in small prey, and eyespots decreased mortality of large prey in some microhabitats. We then exposed artificial prey to naïve domestic chicks in a laboratory setting following a 2 x 3 design (small or large size x no, small, or large eyespots). Predators attacked small prey with eyespots more quickly, but were more wary of large caterpillars with large eyespots than those without eyespots or with small eyespots. Taken together, these data suggest that eyespots are effective deterrents only when both prey and eyespots are large, and that innate aversion toward eyespots is conditional. We conclude that the distribution of eyespots in nature likely results from selection against eyespots in small caterpillars and selection for eyespots in large caterpillars (at least in some microhabitats). © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Many insects possess conspicuous external circular ring markings that resemble the eye of a vertebrate. These 'eyespots' typically function to startle or otherwise deter predators, but few studies have examined how eyespots have evolved. We study the evolution of the posterior larval eyespot in the charismatic New World hawkmoth genus Eumorpha. While Eumorpha has a range of posterior larval eyespot shapes and sizes, little is known of how this trait has evolved because phylogenetic relationships of Eumorpha remain largely unknown. In this study, we included 62 individuals from 23 of 26 described Eumorpha species, and sequenced four genes (CAD, EF-1α, Wingless and COI), totaling 3773 base pairs. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods produced largely congruent trees with well-supported relationships. Our analyses reveal that Eumorpha probably had an ancestor with a posterior larval eyespot and that the eyespot was subsequently lost in at least three lineages. Eumorpha appears to have originated in Central and South America and expanded its distribution to North America. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Selection can facilitate diversification by inducing character displacement in mate choice traits that reduce the probability of maladaptive mating between lineages. Although reproductive character displacement (RCD) has been demonstrated in two-taxa case studies, the frequency of this process in nature is still debated. Moreover, studies have focused primarily on visual and acoustic traits, despite the fact that chemical communication is probably the most common means of species recognition. Here, we showed in a large, mostly sympatric, butterfly genus, a strong pattern of recurrent RCD for predicted male sex pheromone composition, but not for visual mate choice traits. Our results suggest that RCD is not anecdotal, and that selection for divergence in male sex pheromone composition contributed to reproductive isolation within the Bicyclus genus. We propose that selection may target olfactory mate choice traits as a more common sensory modality to ensure reproductive isolation among diverging lineages than previously envisaged. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Adaptations to divert the attacks of visually guided predators have evolved repeatedly in animals. Using high-speed infrared videography, we show that luna moths (Actias luna) generate an acoustic diversion with spinning hindwing tails to deflect echolocating bat attacks away from their body and toward these non-essential appendages. We pit luna moths against big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and demonstrate a survival advantage of ∼47% for moths with tails versus those that had their tails removed. The benefit of hindwing tails is equivalent to the advantage conferred to moths by bat-detecting ears. Moth tails lured bat attacks to these wing regions during 55% of interactions between bats and intact luna moths. We analyzed flight kinematics of moths with and without hindwing tails and suggest that tails have a minimal role in flight performance. Using a robust phylogeny, we find that long spatulate tails have independently evolved four times in saturniid moths, further supporting the selective advantage of this anti-bat strategy. Diversionary tactics are perhaps more common than appreciated in predator-prey interactions. Our finding suggests that focusing on the sensory ecologies of key predators will reveal such countermeasures in prey.

AB  - Aposematic colouration deters visually oriented predators because conspicuous signals are easier to detect and associate with unpalatability. Consequently, brightly coloured prey that are novel are predicted to be preyed on more than those with bright but typical colours. Here we evaluated whether predatory bias is associated with the colour differences observed at two different localities for a large, conspicuously coloured and poisonous Amazonian frog, Adelphobates galactonotus. At each locality predation experiments were carried out using frog models of two naturally occurring colours of the study species (blue and orange) and a control (brown). We found no evidence that novel colours were more vulnerable to predation than local colours. These results do not therefore support our hypothesis that predatory bias explains the geographic variation of colour in A. galactonotus. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.

AB  - Bodies are often made of repeated units, or serial homologs, that develop using the same core gene regulatory network. Local inputs and modifications to this network allow serial homologs to evolve different morphologies, but currently we do not understand which modifications allow these repeated traits to evolve different levels of phenotypic plasticity. Here we describe variation in phenotypic plasticity across serial homologous eyespots of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, hypothesized to be under selection for similar or different functions in the wet and dry seasonal forms. Specifically, we document the presence of eyespot size and scale brightness plasticity in hindwing eyespots hypothesized to vary in function across seasons, and reduced size plasticity and absence of brightness plasticity in forewing eyespots hypothesized to have the same function across seasons. By exploring the molecular and physiological causes of this variation in plasticity across fore and hindwing serial homologs we discover that: 1) temperature experienced during the wandering stages of larval development alters titers of an ecdysteroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in the hemolymph of wet and dry seasonal forms at that stage; 2) the 20E receptor (EcR) is differentially expressed in the forewing and hindwing eyespot centers of both seasonal forms during this critical developmental stage; and 3) manipulations of EcR signaling disproportionately affected hindwing eyespots relative to forewing eyespots. We propose that differential EcR expression across forewing and hindwing eyespots at a critical stage of development explains the variation in levels of phenotypic plasticity across these serial homologues. This finding provides a novel signaling pathway, 20E, and a novel molecular candidate, EcR, for the regulation of levels of phenotypic plasticity across body parts or serial homologs. © 2015 Monteiro et al.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots on butterflywings have been shown to deter predators. This has been traditionally explained by mimicry of vertebrate eyes, but recently the classic eye-mimicry hypothesis has been challenged. It is proposed that the conspicuousness of the eyespot, not mimicry, is what causes aversion due to sensory biases, neophobia or sensory overloads.We conducted an experiment todirectly testwhether the eye-mimicry or the conspicuousness hypothesis better explain eyespot efficacy.We used great tits (Parusmajor) asmodel predator, and tested their reaction towards animated images on a computer display. Birds were tested against images of butterflies without eyespots, with natural-looking eyespots, and manipulated spots with the same contrast but reduced resemblance to an eye, as well as images of predators (owls) with and without eyes. We found that mimetic eyespots were as effective as true eyes of owls and more efficient in eliciting an aversive response than modified, less mimetic but equally contrasting eyespots. We conclude that the eye-mimicry hypothesis explains our results better than the conspicuousness hypothesis and is thus likely to be an important mechanism behind the evolution of butterfly eyespots. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Background: Many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution. Work over the last decade has shown that a major function of eyespots is their ability to reduce predation by being intimidating to attacking predators. Two competing hypotheses seek to explain the cause of intimidation, one suggesting 'eye-mimicry' and the other their 'conspicuousness' as the reason. There is an on-going debate about which of these better explains the effectiveness of eyespots against predation. We undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots. We conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking Junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded. Results: We first established that birds avoided models with a pair of eyespots. However, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness. Non-eye-like, fan shaped patterns derived from eyespots were found to be just as effective as eye-like circular patterns. Furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work. However, across all experiments, models with a pair of patterns, symmetric or asymmetric, eyelike or non-eye-like, suffered from fewer attacks compared with other models. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in prey-predator signalling. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution. © 2015 Mukherjee and Kodandaramaiah; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - This article reviews the latest developments in our understanding of the origin, development, and evolution of nymphalid butterfly eyespots. Recent contributions to this field include insights into the evolutionary and developmental origin of eyespots and their ancestral deployment on the wing, the evolution of eyespot number and eyespot sexual dimorphism, and the identification of genes affecting eyespot development and black pigmentation. I also compare features of old and more recently proposed models of eyespot development and propose a schematic for the genetic regulatory architecture of eyespots. Using this schematic I propose two hypotheses for why we observe limits to morphological diversity across these serially homologous traits. © 2015 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some eyespots are thought to deflect attack away from the vulnerable body, yet there is limited empirical evidence for this function and its adaptive advantage. Here, we demonstrate the conspicuous ventral hindwing eyespots found on Bicyclus anynana butterflies protect against invertebrate predators, specifically praying mantids. Wet season (WS) butterflies with larger, brighter eyespots were easier for mantids to detect, but more difficult to capture compared to dry season (DS) butterflies with small, dull eyespots. Mantids attacked the wing eyespots of WS butterflies more frequently resulting in greater butterfly survival and reproductive success. With a reciprocal eyespot transplant, we demonstrated the fitness benefits of eyespots were independent of butterfly behaviour. Regardless of whether the butterfly was WS or DS, large marginal eyespots pasted on the hindwings increased butterfly survival and successful oviposition during predation encounters. In previous studies, DS B. anynana experienced delayed detection by vertebrate predators, but both forms suffered low survival once detected. Our results suggest predator abundance, identity and phenology may all be important selective forces for B. anynana. Thus, reciprocal selection between invertebrate and vertebrate predators across seasons may contribute to the evolution of the B. anynana polyphenism. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - This paper exposes some considerations on images' agentivity and its links with biology and evolution. Trying to find out which kind of images are able to make people do things without involving any cognitive process, brings us to wonder about the role of natural instinct in our way of communicate. A biosemiotic point of view become thus very important to understand the way of working and the source of agentivity in images. If traditional tools fails to investigate properly a message without a content, biology give us an answer. An answer that we need to understand how and why some images cause a certain reaction in us.

AB  - Many insects exhibit secondary defence mechanisms upon contact with a predator, such as defensive sound production or regurgitation of gut contents. In the tettigoniid Poecilimon ornatus, both males and females are capable of sound production and of regurgitation. However, wing stridulatory structures for intraspecific acoustic communication evolved independently in males and females, and may result in different defence sounds. Here we investigate in P. ornatus whether secondary defence behaviours, in particular defence sounds, show sex-specific differences. The male defence sound differs significantly from the male calling song in that it has a longer syllable duration and a higher number of impulses per syllable. In females, the defence sound syllables are also significantly longer than the syllables of their response song to the male calling song. In addition, the acoustic disturbance stridulation differs notably between females and males as both sexes exhibit different temporal patterns of the defence sound. Furthermore, males use defence sounds more often than females. The higher proportion of male disturbance stridulation is consistent with a male-biased predation risk during calling and phonotactic behaviour. The temporal structures of the female and male defence sounds support a deimatic function of the startling sound in both females and males, rather than an adaptation for a particular temporal pattern. Independently of the clear differences in sound defence, no difference in regurgitation of gut content occurs between the sexes. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In a series of papers, Bence Nanay has recently put forward and defended a new theory of function, which he calls the ‘Modal Theory of Function’. In this article, I critically address this theory and argue that it fails to fulfill some key desiderata that a satisfactory theory of function must comply with. As a result, I conclude that, whatever property Nanay’s notion of function refers to, it is not the property having the function that is standardly attributed in science. © 2014 by the Philosophy of Science Association.

AB  - It has long been believed that the paired circular markings ("eyespots") of Lepidoptera larvae, combined with their defensive postures (where the larvae swell their anterior body segments) protect them from potential predators. These traits could inhibit attacks by enhancing the similarity of the prey item to the predator's own natural enemies (notably snakes), but alternatively, they may simply exploit the predator's wariness of novel and/or conspicuous objects. To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey. In the first experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either without eyespots or with eyespots positioned in 1 of 2 locations on their bodies: anteriorly or centrally. In the second experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either lacking the thickening associated with the defensive posture, or with models in which a thickened section was placed centrally or anteriorly. In both cases, the chicks were significantly more wary of prey with anteriorly positioned defensive traits than either prey without these traits or prey with centrally positioned traits. Because prey with central eyespots and central thickening were equally novel and conspicuousness to those with these traits positioned in a more head-like anterior position, we infer that predator wariness was primarily influenced by the similarity of the prey to their potential natural enemies. These results support the idea that both caterpillar eyespots, and the defensive posture examined here, deter predators not simply because they are conspicuous, but because they enhance caterpillars' resemblance to potentially dangerous vertebrates. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

AB  - In modern biology, the appearance of organisms is largely understood as an adaptation serving the survival function. Here we advance a biosemiotic perspective inspired by the works of Adolf Portmann and Jakob von Uexküll. From this perspective, the visual dimension of every living being can be understood as a representation of the evolutionary experience of a species. In the study of animal displays, biosemiotics focuses on the qualitative perspective in both the logic behind the emergence of such signs as well as their perception and interpretation by perceiving animals. In this study, we claim that convergence of the animal surface patterns that stem developmentally from different ontogenetic precursors should be taken as evidence for congruence in biological meaning. As a specific example, the article discusses the development, perception, and evolution of semantic organs such as eyespots on butterfly wings and vertebrate eyes. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The diversity of anti-predator adaptations in the natural world has long been an active area of research in evolutionary and behavioural biology. A common visually-obvious feature found on prey are 'eyespots', being approximately circular markings often with concentric rings and conspicuous colours. These are found on a range of animals, especially adult and larval Lepidoptera and fish. One of the most widespread functions of eyespots seems to be to intimidate or startle predators: delaying, preventing or halting an attack. However, while the fact that they can influence predators in this way is uncontroversial, the mechanism(s) behind why they are effective is debated. Traditionally, they have been assumed to work by mimicking the eyes of the predator's own enemies, and much research in this field is conducted under the implicit or explicit assumption that this theory is correct. However, eyespots might work simply by being highly salient stimuli that promote sensory overload, biases, or neophobic reactions in predators. A range of recent studies has aimed to test these alternatives. Here, we critically evaluate this work and what it tells us about the mechanisms underlying eyespot function. We conclude that although eye mimicry is plausible, there remains a lack of evidence to support it and most observations are at least equally consistent with alternative mechanisms. Finally, we also discuss how the debate can be resolved. © 2014 Current Zoology.

AB  - Deceptive antipredator defense mechanisms fall into three categories: depriving predators of knowledge of prey's presence, providing cues that deceive predators about prey handling, and dishonest signaling. Deceptive defenses in terrestrial vertebrates include aspects of crypsis such as background matching and countershading, visual and acoustic Batesian mimicry, active defenses that make animals seem more difficult to handle such as increase in apparent size and threats, feigning injury and death, distractive behaviours, and aspects of flight. After reviewing these defenses, I attempt a preliminary evaluation of which aspects of antipredator deception are most widespread in amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. © 2014 Current Zoology.

AB  - Junonia evarete Cramer is a fast-flying butterfly that perches on the ground with wings opened exhibiting four eyespots close to wing borders. These eyespots presumably function either to intimidate predators, like insectivorous birds, or to deflect bird attacks to less vital parts of the body. We assessed the form, frequency, and location of beak marks on the wings of wild butterflies in central Brazil during two not consecutive years. We found that almost 50% of males and 80% of females bore signals of predator attacks (wing tears), most of them consisting of partially or totally V-shaped forms apparently produced by birds. Males were significantly less attacked and showed a lower proportion of attacks on eyespots than females, suggesting they are better to escape bird attacks. In contrast, females were heavily attacked on eyespots. Eyespot tears in females were higher (and significant different) than expected by chance, indicating that birds do attempt to reach the eyespots when striking on these butterflies. Other comparisons involving the proportion of tears directed or not directed to eyespots in males and females are presented and discussed. © 2013 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Beak marks on butterfly wings have been used as an indicator of predation pressure. The relationship between butterflies and their predators in the field was examined to evaluate the beak mark rate as an indicator of predation pressure. Transect censuses were conducted to measure the beak mark rate on butterflies from May to November, 2010, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. A total of 1216 butterflies of 42 species from five families were observed during the study period. The beak mark rate in the Papilionidae was significantly higher than those of all other families. Analysis of the monthly fluctuations in the beak mark rate and relative abundance of predators revealed that the higher beak mark rates observed for two butterfly families (Papilionidae and Nymphalidae) were significantly and positively related to predation pressure, while no significant relationship was found for other families (Lycaenidae, Pieridae and Hesperiidae). Beak marks in larger butterflies (Papilionidae and Nymphalidae) can be used as an indicator to evaluate the relative intensity of predation pressure in the field. © 2014 The Entomological Society of Japan.

AB  - In 1909, Abbott Thayer suggested that the study of animal coloration lies in the domain of artists because it deals with optical illusions. He proposed, for example, that prey color patterns may obliterate the animal's outline to make the wearer appear invisible to its predators. Despite a long history of research on the neuropsychology of visual illusions in humans, the question of whether they can occur in other animals has remained largely neglected. In this review, we first examine whether the visual effects generated by an animal's shape, coloration, movement, social environment, or direct manipulation of the environment might distort the receiver's perspective to form an illusion. We also consider how illusions fit into the wider conceptual framework of sensory perception and receiver psychology, in order to understand the potential significance of these (and other) visual effects in animal communication. Secondly, we consider traits that manipulate visual processing tasks to intimidate or mislead the viewer. In the third part of the review, we consider the more extreme cases of sensory manipulation, in which individuals or their traits disrupt, overstimulate, or inactivate receivers' sensory systems. Although illusions present just one form of sensory manipulation, we suggest that they are likely to be more common than previously suspected. Furthermore, we expect that research in this area of sensory processing will provide significant insights into the cognitive psychology of animal communication. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Aposematism involves predators learning conspicuous signals of defended prey. However, prey species utilize a wide range of chemical (or physical) defenses, which are not likely to be equally aversive to all predators. Aposematism may therefore only be effective against a physiologically sensitive subset of potential predators, and this can only be identified through behavioral testing. We studied the emerging model organism Tectocoris diophthalmus (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), an aposematically colored but weakly defended shieldback stinkbug, to test the efficacy of its defenses against a suite of predator types. We predicted the bugs' defenses would be ineffectual against both experienced and naïve birds but aversive to predaceous insects. Surprisingly, the opposite pattern was found. Both habituated wild passerines and naïve chickens avoided the bugs, the chickens after only one or two encounters. To avian predators, T. diophthalmus is aposematic. However, praying mantids showed no repellency, aversion, or toxicity associated with adult or juvenile bugs after multiple trials. Comparison with prior studies on mantids using bugs with chemically similar but more concentrated defenses underscores the importance of dose in addition to chemical identity in the efficacy of chemical defenses. Our results also emphasize the importance of behavioral testing with multiple ecologically relevant predators to understand selective pressures shaping aposematic signals and chemical defenses. We tested the defenses of the aposematically colored hibiscus harlequin bug against multiple predatory taxa. We predicted based on the literature that arthropods would be repelled while defenses would not be effective against birds. Experiment showed the opposite pattern, wherein birds learned avoidance and predaceous arthropod were unaffected. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Eyespots are conspicuous circular features found on the wings of several lepidopteran insects. Two prominent hypotheses have been put forth explaining their function in an antipredatory role. The deflection hypothesis posits that eyespots enhance survival in direct physical encounters with predators by deflecting attacks away from vital parts of the body, whereas the intimidation hypothesis posits that eyespots are advantageous by scaring away a potential predator before an attack. In the light of these two hypotheses, we investigated the evolution of eyespot size and its interaction with position and number within a phylogenetic context in a group of butterflies belonging to the genus Junonia. We found that larger eyespots tend to be found individually, rather than in serial dispositions. Larger size and conspicuousness make intimidating eyespots more effective, and thus, we suggest that our results support an intimidation function in some species of Junonia with solitary eyespots. Our results also show that smaller eyespots in Junonia are located closer to the wing margin, thus supporting predictions of the deflection hypothesis. The interplay between size, position, and arrangement of eyespots in relation to antipredation and possibly sexual selection, promises to be an interesting field of research in the future. Similarly, further comparative work on the evolution of absolute eyespot size in natural populations of other butterfly groups is needed. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - People are more cooperative when explicitly observed, and simply exposing people to images of eyes or faces has been shown to increase cooperation of various types and in various contexts, albeit with notable, if controversial, exceptions. This 'eyes effect' is important both for its potential real-world applications and for its implications regarding the role of reputation in the evolution and maintenance of human cooperation. Based on the general principle that organisms eventually cease responding to uninformative stimuli, we predicted that the eyes effect would be eliminated by prolonged exposure. A novel experiment confirmed that participants exposed briefly to an eye-like image gave more money in an economic game than those in a longer exposure condition and those in a control condition. There was no generosity difference between the long exposure and control conditions. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 25 eyes effects experiments confirmed that the effect emerges reliably after short exposures to eye images, but not after long exposures. An understanding of the limits of false cues on behaviour helps resolve empirical discrepancies regarding the eyes effect and exonerates the importance of reputation even in anonymous, one-shot interactions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - How did human societies scale up from small, tight-knit groups of hunter-gatherers to the large, anonymous, cooperative societies of today--even though anonymity is the enemy of cooperation? How did organized religions with "Big Gods"--the great monotheistic and polytheistic faiths--spread to colonize most minds in the world? In Big Gods, Ara Norenzayan makes the surprising and provocative argument that these fundamental puzzles about the origins of civilization are one and the same, and answer each other. Once human minds could conceive of supernatural beings, Norenzayan argues, the stage was set for rapid cultural and historical changes that eventually led to large societies with Big Gods--powerful, omniscient, interventionist deities concerned with regulating the moral behavior of humans. How? As the saying goes, "watched people are nice people." It follows that people play nice when they think Big Gods are watching them, even when no one else is. Yet at the same time that sincere faith in Big Gods unleashed unprecedented cooperation within ever-expanding groups, it also introduced a new source of potential conflict between competing groups. In some parts of the world, such as northern Europe, secular institutions have precipitated religion's decline by usurping its community-building functions. These societies with atheist majorities--some of the most cooperative, peaceful, and prosperous in the world--climbed religion's ladder, and then kicked it away. So while Big Gods answers fundamental questions about the origins and spread of world religions, it also helps us understand another, more recent social transition--the rise of cooperative societies without belief in gods. © 2013 by Princeton University Press.

AB  - Deception is ubiquitous in plant and animal kingdoms and is widely thought to provide selective advantages to the individual and evolutionary success to the species. Mimicry, a form of deception whereby an individual imitates their model to advantage by closely resembling their behavior or appearance, is particularly well documented and represented by the peripheral eyespots seen on the wings of many butterfly species. The significance of butterfly eyespots has been convincingly demonstrated to serve as an anti-predatory function either by imitation of a predator's own dangerous enemies (intimidation hypothesis) or by deflecting predator strikes toward less-vital parts of the body (deflection hypothesis). A convincing and compelling explanation in butterflies, the functional role of eyespots as anti-predatory devices has become a widely held and firmly entrenched belief that has been freely adopted into other systems. Here we comment on a recent paper that demonstrates a vastly different role for eyespots, that of intra-specific male-male competition, and make the point that even long-held beliefs need to be tested and challenged under different contexts if we are not to be deceived ourselves. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Eyespots (colour patterns consisting of concentric rings) are found in a wide range of animal taxa and are often assumed to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have found strong evidence for an intimidating effect of eyespots against passerine birds. Some eyespots have been suggested to increase prey survival by diverting attacks towards less vital body parts or a direction that would facilitate escape. While eyespots in aquatic environments are widespread, their function is extremely understudied. Therefore, we investigated the protective function of eyespots against attacking fish. We used artificial prey and predator-naive three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as predators to test both the diversion (deflection) and the intimidation hypothesis. Interestingly, our results showed that eyespots smaller than the fish' own eye very effectively draw the attacks of the fish towards them. Furthermore, our experiment also showed that this was not due to the conspicuousness of the eyespot, because attack latency did not differ between prey items with and without eyespots. We found little support for an intimidating effect by larger eyespots. Even though also other markings might misdirect attacks, we can conclude that the misdirecting function may have played an important role in the evolution of eyespots in aquatic environments. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - The animal world is full of brilliant colours and striking patterns that serve to hide individuals or attract the attention of others. False eyespots are pervasive across a variety of animal taxa and are among nature's most conspicuous markings. Understanding the adaptive significance of eyespots has long fascinated evolutionary ecologists. Here we show for the first time that the size of eyespots is plastic and increases upon exposure to predators. Associated with the growth of eyespots there is a corresponding reduction in growth of eyes in juvenile Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrusamboinensis. These morphological changes likely direct attacks away from the head region. Exposure to predators also induced changes in prey behaviour and morphology. Such changes could prevent or deter attacks and increase burst speed, aiding in escape. Damselfish exposed to predators had drastically higher survival suffering only 10% mortality while controls suffered 60% mortality 72 h after release.

AB  - We describe the final instars of two tropical Sphingidae caterpillars - Eumorpha phorbas and Eumorpha labruscae - from Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica, whose anal horn has become a posterior eyespot structure capable of rapid palpitation. When approached or harassed, the caterpillars palpitate this eyespot and produce the effect of a blinking vertebrate eye. We propose that this "blinking" is an extension of eye mimicry or at least draws attention to the eyespot, functioning to startle or intimidate would-be predators. As snakes lack eyelids and do not blink, this suggests that the blinking eye represents a more generalized (or possibly mammalian) eye. Eyespot "blinking" is probably controlled by the same musculature used to wave the anal horn in earlier instars. The extent to which this eyespot is perceived as a blinking eye, and the degree of protection from the caterpillars' suite of potential predators, remain to be discovered. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Small eyespots on butterflies have long been thought to deflect attacks, and birds are the presumptive drivers selecting for these patterns; however, evidence of this function is still ambiguous. Marginal eyespots typically consist of a UV-reflective white pupil, surrounded by one black and one yellowish ring. We have recently shown that Cyanistes caeruleus (blue tits) attack such eyespots, but only under low light intensities with accentuated UV levels: the increased salience of the eyespots relative to the rest of the butterfly probably explains this result. Possibly the background against which the butterfly is concealed may deceive birds to make similar errors. We therefore presented speckled wood butterflies decorated with eyespots (or controls without eyespots) to C. caeruleus against two backgrounds: oak and birch bark. Our results show that: (1) eyespots, independent of background, were effective in deflecting attacks; (2) the time elapsed between a bird landing and the attack was interactively dependent on the background and whether the butterfly bore an eyespot; and (3) the speed at which a butterfly was attacked predicted the outcome, with faster birds being more prone to errors than slower birds. This underscores a speed-accuracy trade-off in the predators, and that background plays a role in the defensive qualities of marginal eyespots. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Myrmecophily is widespread in lycaenid butterflies, in which ants receive food resources and, in turn, protect caterpillars against natural enemies. This interaction ranges from obligate myrmecophily, in which immatures are invariably associated with ants and are dependent on ants for survival, and facultative myrmecophily, in which larvae are not dependent on ants for survival, but the presence of the latter may increase larvae survival. Lycaenids also include non-myrmecophilous butterflies, which do not have positive associations with ants and have developed strategies to avoid being attacked or preyed upon by them. In this study, we examined the relationship between the lycaenid Michaelus ira and two ant species associated with Distictella elongata (Bignoniaceae). This plant has extrafloral nectaries and is patrolled by Camponotus crassus and Ectatomma tuberculatum. Morphological analyses revealed that M. ira larvae have ant organs, such as dorsal nectary organs and perforated cupolas, structures associated with myrmecophily. We performed larval exposure experiments in the field, predicting that, in the absence of myrmecophily, the butterfly larva would present strategies to avoid ant attack. Results showed that larvae were attacked by both ant species. To escape ant molestation, larvae lived and fed inside silk-sealed D. elongata flower buds. We concluded that the M. ira bud-sheltering behavior was a defensive strategy against these ant species, while the dorsal nectary organs were apparently nonfunctional. Nonetheless, myrmecophily, in general, cannot be excluded in M. ira since relationships with other ant species may exist. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.

AB  - The hypothesis of satyric mimicry postulates that the colour patterns of an animal may make its identity ambiguous, and this ambiguity interferes with the process of perception in vertebrate predators for a sufficient time to allow the potential prey to take evasive action. It has now been found that eyespots and other designs on the wings of many insect species are often coupled with other wing patterns and designs. These composite images often closely resemble heads and bodies of vertebrates (including birds and reptiles) and of various invertebrates. Such images can be perceived in living insects, although only rarely in set specimens because of displacement of the components. Visual processing by non-mammalian vertebrates generally involves attention to detail, suggesting that, at least initially, and unlike humans, they perceive embedded images on insect wings and bodies and ignore the whole or Gestalt. They are therefore likely to be confused by the ambiguity of the potential prey. It can be calculated that a delay of the order of only tenths of a second in the attack on a stationary insect by a predator could result in failure of capture. It is proposed in the present review that the concept of satyric mimicry be extended to include complex imagery of other organisms. Such iconic images, which often represent toxic or dangerous animals, are particularly common amongst saturniid moths and nymphalid and danaid butterflies (including the Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus). © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Antipredator defenses are ubiquitous and diverse. Ink secretion of sea hares (Aplysia) is an antipredator defense acting through the chemical senses of predators by different mechanisms. The most common mechanism is ink acting as an unpalatable repellent. Less common is ink secretion acting as a decoy (phagomimic) that misdirects predators' attacks. In this study, we tested another possible mechanism - sensory inactivation - in which ink inactivates the predator's reception of food odors associated with would-be prey. We tested this hypothesis using spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, as model predators. Ink secretion is composed of two glandular products, one being opaline, a viscous substance containing concentrations of hundreds of millimolar of total free amino acids. Opaline sticks to antennules, mouthparts and other chemosensory appendages of lobsters, physically blocking access of food odors to the predator's chemosensors, or over-stimulating (short term) and adapting (long term) the chemosensors. We tested the sensory inactivation hypotheses by treating the antennules with opaline and mimics of its physical and/or chemical properties. We compared the effects of these treatments on responses to a food odor for chemoreceptor neurons in isolated antennules, as a measure of effect on chemosensory input, and for antennular motor responses of intact lobsters, as a measure of effect on chemically driven motor behavior. Our results indicate that opaline reduces the output of chemosensors by physically blocking reception of and response to food odors, and this has an impact on motor responses of lobsters. This is the first experimental demonstration of inactivation of peripheral sensors as an antipredatory defense. © 2013. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - The deflection of attack from vital organs to the wing margin is regarded as an important adaptation in hairstreak butterflies. However, this "lose-little-to-save-much" strategy akin to the detachable lizard's tail had never been tested experimentally. The present study tests the "false head" hypothesis by exposing a hairstreak butterfly, Calycopis cecrops, as well as many other Lepidoptera species as controls, to the attacks of the jumping spider, Phidippus pulcherrimus. The results unambiguously indicate that the "false head" is a very efficient strategy in deflecting attacks from the vital centres of the hairstreak butterfly whereas other similar-sized Lepidoptera fall easy prey. Predator fatigue resulting from unsuccessful attacks was also observed, suggesting that jumping spiders can learn to avoid attacking prey they cannot capture, which would increase the efficiency of the "false head" as a defensive mechanism. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A large sample of trapped adult males of' Hyaloplwra euryalus, H. Columbia gloveri, and intergrades from a hybrid zone between these taxa were scored for seven categories of wing damage. A total of 6.1% of 471 adults showed wing damage consistent with bird strikes. Among categories of wing damage, a significantly higher frequency of strikes involved the HW discal spot and the apical eye spot. Patterns of wing damage and behavior of adults when threatened were evaluated in the context of formal models of wing markings as anti-predator mechanisms. Discal spots may act to intimidate predators, while apical eye spots may deflect attacks away from the body. Certain markings are highly conserved and concordant with DNA-based saturniid phylogeny.

AB  - Evo-devo seeks to explain the origins of novelties in terms of genetics. Butterfly eyespots offer a fertile subfield for such investigations. Previous explanations for the origin of eyespots are reviewed, and a new hypothesis is presented. According to this new "Recursion Model," eyespots are ectopic versions of the wing margin. Evidence for this equivalence includes: (1) secretion of the morphogen Wingless, (2) expression of the homeobox gene Distal-less, and (3) specification of outlying contours that take the form of stripes or rings. These three steps constitute a modular program that was initially executed only at the margin. The model proposes that eyespots were created when the program was accidentally rebooted (recursively) at certain points in the wing blade by a fortuitous mutation that occurred at the dawn of the Nymphalid family. Those points are located wherever two interacting genes are expressed. Gene A is expressed midway between adjacent wing veins, while gene B is expressed at a certain distance from the wing margin. The mutation is thought to have installed a new cis-enhancer at the wingless gene locus, which was uniquely responsive to the combination of A and B inputs. Because the postulated enhancer should be easy to pinpoint by transgenic in vivo assays of reporter constructs, this new model is directly testable. If it proves correct, then eyespots would become one of only a few putative cases where a novel feature arose suddenly. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Eyespots on the body of many animals have long been assumed to confer protection against predators, but empirical evidence has recently demonstrated that this may not always be the case and suggested that such markings may also serve other purposes. Clearly, this raises the unresolved question of what functions do these markings have and do they contribute to an individual's evolutionary fitness in the wild. Here, we examined the occurrence of eyespots on the dorsal fin of a coral reef damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), where these markings are typical of the juvenile stage and fade away as the fish approaches sexual maturation to then disappear completely in the vast majority of, but not all, adult individuals. By exploring differences in body shape among age and gender groups, we found that individuals retaining the eyespot into adulthood are all sexually mature males, suggesting that these eyespots may be an adult deceptive signal. Interestingly, the body shape of these individuals resembled more closely that of immature females than mature dominant males. These results suggest that eyespots have multiple roles and their functional significance changes within the lifetime of an animal from being a juvenile advertisement to a deceptive adult signal. Male removal experiments or colour manipulations may be necessary to establish specific functions. © 2013 Gagliano, Depczynski.

AB  - How did the zebra really get its stripes, and the giraffe its long neck? What is the science behind camel humps, leopard spots, and other animal oddities? Such questions have fascinated us for centuries, but the expanding field of evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology) is now providing, for the first time, a wealth of insights and answers. Taking inspiration from Kipling's ‘Just So Stories’, this book weaves emerging insights from evo-devo into a narrative that provides startling explanations for the origin and evolution of traits across the animal kingdom. Held's unique and engaging style makes this narrative both enlightening and entertaining, guiding students and researchers through even complex concepts and encouraging a fuller understanding of the latest developments in the field. The first five chapters cover the first bilaterally symmetric animals, flies, butterflies, snakes, and cheetahs. A final chapter surveys recent results about a menagerie of other animals. © L. I.

AB  - This study describes and compares the diverse dorsal and ventral wing color patterns of Brassolini butterflies. Thirty-three species are illustrated, where pattern elements of the nymphalid ground plan are labeled in color. In general, a larger number of pattern elements can be identified on the ventral than on the dorsal surface of both wings, and the forewing has a larger number of discernible pattern elements than the hind wing. The dorsal elements are broad, diffuse, and more difficult to identify against the typically brown brassoline wing background color. Species with a light colored dorsal background served as a guide for our proposal that fewer pattern elements are present dorsally, particularly on the hind wing. Colorful bands or markings generally present on the dorsal surface seem to be associated with specific pattern elements and have correspondence to the ventral pattern. We refer to these as trailing bands, and they constitute a predominant feature of the brassoline dorsal coloration. We propose a subordinate groundplan for brassolines and interpret some of the ventral pattern variation in light of their phylogeny. Dorsal color pattern variation that leads to sexual dimorphism and mimetic resemblance are also discussed.

AB  - The incredible diversity of colour patterns in coral reef fishes has intrigued biologists for centuries. Yet, despite the many proposed explanations for this diversity in coloration, definitive tests of the role of ecological factors in shaping the evolution of particular colour pattern traits are absent. Patterns such as spots and eyespots (spots surrounded by concentric rings of contrasting colour) have often been assumed to function for predator defence by mimicking predators' enemies' eyes, deflecting attacks or intimidating predators, but the evolutionary processes underlying these functions have never been addressed. Striped body patterns have been suggested to serve for both social communication and predator defence, but the impact of ecological constraints remains unclear. We conducted the first comparative analysis of colour pattern diversity in butterflyfishes (Family: Chaetodontidae), fishes with conspicuous spots, eyespots and wide variation in coloration. Using a dated molecular phylogeny of 95 species (approx. 75% of the family), we tested whether spots and eyespots have evolved characteristics that are consistent with their proposed defensive function and whether the presence of spots and body stripes is linked with species' body length, dietary complexity, habitat diversity or social behaviour. Contrary to our expectations, spots and eyespots appeared relatively recently in butterflyfish evolution and are highly evolutionarily labile, suggesting that they are unlikely to have played an important part in the evolutionary history of the group. Striped body patterns showed correlated evolution with a number of ecological factors including habitat type, sociality and dietary complexity. Our findings question the prevailing view that eyespots are an evolutionary response to predation pressure, providing a valuable counter example to the role of these markings as revealed in other taxa. 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Animal camouflage is a textbook example of natural selection. Despite substantial progress, one historical theory remains controversial: that conspicuous "distractive" markings draw predator attention away from the prey outline, preventing detection. Here, we present evidence from 4 experiments to resolve this controversy. In field experiments, we measured bird predation on artificial cryptic prey that were either unmarked or had distractive markings of various attributes (number, color, and location). Prey with 3 high-contrast distractive markings, and with markings located away from the body outline, suffered reduced survival compared with unmarked controls or prey with low-contrast markings. There was no effect of small single markings with different colors on the survival of targets. In 2 computer-based experiments with human subjects searching for hidden targets, distractive markings of various types (number, size, and location) reduced detection times compared with controls. This effect was greatest for targets that had large or 3 markings. In addition, small and centrally placed markings facilitated faster learning. Therefore, these 2 experimental approaches show that distractive markings are detrimental to camouflage, both facilitating initial detection and increasing the speed of predator learning. Our experiments also suggest that learning of camouflaged prey is dependent on the type of camouflage present. Contrary to current and historical discussion, conspicuous markings are more likely to impair camouflage than enhance it, presenting important implications for the optimization of prey coloration in general. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - Large conspicuous eyespots have evolved in multiple taxa and presumably function to thwart predator attacks. Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to simply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Inachis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted over. Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - To examine the mechanisms and time course of visual search behavior, we rewarded 6 experienced pigeons for locating and pecking at an odd target region randomly embedded in a larger rectangular array of contrasting distractor elements. On two-target test trials, a flanking secondary target region was briefly presented (100, 250, or 500 ms) after display onset with stimulus onset asynchrony values of 0, 50, 100, 175, 250, 375, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 ms. Two types of interference effects were possibly identified with target localization accuracy. One type occurred early in processing, where the secondary target appeared to interfere with search behavior, perhaps involving mechanisms similar to inhibition of return. A second type of interference was isolated that appeared to be time locked to responding and might occur at a postsearch stage of processing. Several possible connections of these effects to established mechanisms in human visual search and attention are suggested. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

AB  - A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90. h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Animals display incredibly diverse color patterns yet little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these phenotypes. However, emerging results are reshaping our view of how the process of phenotypic evolution occurs. Here, we outline recent research from three particularly active areas of investigation: melanin pigmentation in Drosophila, wing patterning in butterflies, and pigment variation in lizards. For each system, we highlight (i) the function and evolution of color variation, (ii) various approaches that have been used to explore the genetic basis of pigment variation, and (iii) conclusions regarding the genetic basis of convergent evolution which have emerged from comparative analyses. Results from these studies indicate that natural variation in pigmentation is a particularly powerful tool to examine the molecular basis of evolution, especially with regard to convergent or parallel evolution. Comparison of these systems also reveals that the molecular basis of convergent evolution is heterogeneous, sometimes involving conserved mechanisms and sometimes not. In the near future, additional work in other emerging systems will substantially expand the scope of available comparisons. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Many species of lepidoptera bear conspicuous circular patterns on their wings, known as eyespots, that are hypothesised to protect their bearers against predatory birds. In this study, we focus on a small but ubiquitous feature occurring naturally in lepidopteran eyespots, namely the so-called 'sparkle'. The 'pupil' in an eyespot is often highlighted by a 'sparkle', which is hypothesised to mimic a natural corneal total light reflection evident as a highlight, twinkle, or sparkle in the vertebrate eye. In a study exploring the presence of such sparkles, we found that 53% of lepidopteran eyespots exceeding 1mm in diameter have a central, pinpoint-like 'sparkle', 12% have a marginal, crescent-shaped 'sparkle', 13% have a semi-circular 'sparkle', and 22% have an intermediate semi-circular to crescent-shaped 'sparkle'. In the lepidopterans' natural resting position, the marginal 'sparkles' are positioned in the upper part of the eyespots''pupil' and thus may create the illusion of a spherical eyeball. The 'sparkles' in lepidopteran eyespots do not only appear white to humans, but also reflect ultraviolet light. White and UV-reflecting 'sparkles' also appear 'white' for UV-sensitive viewers such as birds, and thus may effectively mimic the natural highlight in vertebrate eyes as an area of total light reflection. In field experiments using lepidopteran dummies baited with a mealworm, we show that the 'sparkle' is one of several components of eyespots eliciting a deterrent effect and that eyespots with a 'sparkle' in a natural position have a stronger deterrent effect than those with a 'sparkle' in an unnatural position. These findings support the eye mimicry hypothesis that better vertebrate eye mimicry improves the deterrent effect of eyespots. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Charitable behaviour is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective: why does such behaviour exist despite its costs, and what causes it to evolve and persist? Answering such questions helps us to promote helping and charitable behaviours. In this chapter, I examine various selective pressures that select for cooperative sentiment and how these might be harnessed to promote helping. In particular, I focus on reputation-based theories (indirect reciprocity, punishment, costly signaling) because these are more novel and important for the generalized helping seen in many humans. I discuss how reputation promotes helping, how to take advantage of its effects, the linkage of cooperative acts with reputational pressures, as well as several important limitations that must be addressed before the science of reputation is mature enough to maximize its effectiveness. © Oxford University Press, 2012.

AB  - Background: The origin and modification of novel traits are important aspects of biological diversification. Studies combining concepts and approaches of developmental genetics and evolutionary biology have uncovered many examples of the recruitment, or co-option, of genes conserved across lineages for the formation of novel, lineage-restricted traits. However, little is known about the evolutionary history of the recruitment of those genes, and of the relationship between them -for example, whether the co-option involves whole or parts of existing networks, or whether it occurs by redeployment of individual genes with de novo rewiring. We use a model novel trait, color pattern elements on butterfly wings called eyespots, to explore these questions. Eyespots have greatly diversified under natural and sexual selection, and their formation involves genetic circuitries shared across insects. Results: We investigated the evolutionary history of the recruitment and co-recruitment of four conserved transcription regulators to the larval wing disc region where circular pattern elements develop. The co-localization of Antennapedia, Notch, Distal-less, and Spalt with presumptive (eye)spot organizers was examined in 13 butterfly species, providing the largest comparative dataset available for the system. We found variation between families, between subfamilies, and between tribes. Phylogenetic reconstructions by parsimony and maximum likelihood methods revealed an unambiguous evolutionary history only for Antennapedia, with a resolved single origin of eyespot-associated expression, and many homoplastic events for Notch, Distal-less, and Spalt. The flexibility in the (co-)recruitment of the targeted genes includes cases where different gene combinations are associated with morphologically similar eyespots, as well as cases where identical protein combinations are associated with very different phenotypes. Conclusions: The evolutionary history of gene (co-)recruitment is consistent with both divergence from a recruited putative ancestral network, and with independent co-option of individual genes. The diversity in the combinations of genes expressed in association with eyespot formation does not parallel diversity in characteristics of the adult phenotype. We discuss these results in the context of inferring homology. Our study underscores the importance of widening the representation of phylogenetic, morphological, and genetic diversity in order to establish general principles about the mechanisms behind the evolution of novel traits. © 2012 Shirai et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Numerous butterflies have circular patterns called eyespots on their wings. Explanations for their functional value have until recently remained hypothetical. However, several studies in the last few years have supported long-standing hypotheses, and the current paper reviews these recent advances. Large and conspicuous eyespots are thought to be effective by being intimidating to predators and thus reducing predation. This hypothesis has received strong support in different studies. It has been shown that eyespots are intimidating because of their conspicuousness, but experimental support for the idea that eyespots are effective by mimicking vertebrate eyes is at the moment lacking. Studies have also tested the deflection hypothesis, where smaller marginal eyespots are thought to deflect attacks away from the body of the prey, increasing chances of survival with a torn wing. Despite previous negative results, recent work has shown that eyespots can indeed deflect attacks toward themselves under specific conditions. Furthermore, data show that dorsal eyespots are used by males and females as signals during courtship. How the diversity in ventral eyespot patterning has evolved remains a mystery. Future directions and further challenges in understanding the adaptive value of eyespots are discussed. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - Predation experiments have shown that the large eyespots (concentric rings of contrasting colors) found on the wings of several lepidopteran species intimidate passerine predators. According to the eye mimicry hypotheses, the intimidation is caused by predators associating the eyespots with the presence (of the eyes) of their own enemy. The conspicuousness hypothesis suggests, instead, that it is simply the conspicuousness of eyespot patterns that is intimidating, possibly due to a sensory bias. We studied how the number of eyespots, 2 or 4, influences intimidation. We predicted that if eye mimicry is important, the maximum response would be reached with a pair of eyespots. On the other hand, if conspicuousness is important, then more than 2 eyespots should result in an even stronger response. The peacock butterfly, Inachis io, has 4 large eyespots on its wings. We presented naïve insectivorous birds (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca) 2 different prey items made from wings of dead peacock butterflies and a mealworm between the wings. One group of birds received prey that had no or only 2 eyespots visible and the other group received prey that had no or all 4 eyespots visible. Eyespots clearly increased hesitation before attacks. Because the birds were naïve, this difference in response to the eyespots was innate. Importantly, there was no difference in attack latency between 2 and 4 eyespots. We conclude that it is unlikely that conspicuousness as such has selected for eyespots in the peacock butterfly. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - The history of life is a history of evolutionary innovations, qualitatively new phenotypic traits that endow their bearers with new, often game-changing abilities. We know many individual examples of innovations and their natural history, but we know little about the fundamental principles of phenotypic variability that permit new phenotypes to arise. Most phenotypic innovations result from changes in three classes of systems: metabolic networks, regulatory circuits, and macromolecules. I here highlight two important features that these classes of systems share. The first is the ubiquity of vast genotype networks - connected sets of genotypes with the same phenotype. The second is the great phenotypic diversity of small neighborhoods around different genotypes in genotype space. I here explain that both features are essential for the phenotypic variability that can bring forth qualitatively new phenotypes. Both features emerge from a common cause, the robustness of phenotypes to perturbations, whose origins are linked to life in changing environments. © 2011.

AB  - Eyespots (patterns of roughly concentric rings) are often thought to have an anti-predator function. Previous experiments have lent support for the intimidation hypothesis by demonstrating a deterring effect of eyespots, but so far there is little evidence for the deflective effect (direction of attacks toward less vital body parts). We studied predators' responses towards large and small eyespots and towards prey with no, one, or a pair of eyespots and if this response is influenced by whether or not prey blend into background. In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators. In experiment 1, we found evidence for the deflective effect of small but not large eyespots, independent of whether the prey was presented on a concealing or exposing background. In experiment 2, we found that predators avoided the prey with a pair of small eyespots more than the prey without eyespots, but interestingly, we only found this deterring effect on the concealing background. There was no difference in attacks between the prey with one large and two small or one large and no eyespots. We conclude that deflective function may select for eyespots, and background may influence the deterring function of eyespots. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Many studies have examined defensive strategies of adult lepidopterans against bird predation. However, detailed field observations that describe how lepidopterans are hunted by wild birds are quite limited. I observed foraging behavior of wild tree sparrows on adult lepidopterans from May to June 2006 at Mt Yoshida, Kyoto, Japan. A total of 253 foraging attempts on at least 14 species of lepidopterans were observed. The tree sparrows attacked both resting and flying lepidopterans. When a tree sparrow approached a resting lepidopteran, the lepidopteran frequently flew to escape predation. The number of feeding attempts for resting and flying lepidopterans was 215 and 38, respectively. This result indicates that resting lepidopterans are the main target of predation by the tree sparrow. It is therefore considered that reducing the risk of detection is important for lepidopterans to avoid predation by the tree sparrow. Coloration as crypsis is probably effective in this respect. © 2011 The Entomological Society of Japan.

AB  - Documentation of predator attacks in nature is important for understanding how specific antipredator defences have evolved, but previous accounts have been mostly anecdotal. Therefore, we monitored predation on two closely related butterfly species, Aglais urticae and Inachis io, during winter hibernation. Butterflies were placed singly close to the floor on walls in dark, seminatural hibernation sites (e.g. unheated outhouses). We used motion-initiated infrared-sensitive cameras to record predator attacks on the butterflies. The antipredator attributes of the two species have two characteristics: during rest the butterflies reduce predators' attention by mimicking leaves but they can suddenly change their guise by repeatedly flicking their wings. The wing flicking also produces hissing sounds and ultrasonic clicks and, furthermore, I. io, but not A. urticae, have large eyespots on the dorsal wing surface. The two butterfly species suffer from mouse predation during the winter and mice have been suggested as potential targets for the butterflies' sound production. Results showed that (1) mice (Apodemus spp.) were important predators on butterflies, (2) I. io often survived attacks by wing-flicking behaviour, and (3) both species moved to less accessible positions after interactions with mice and other small mammalian predators, but I. io more often so. The successful predator evasion in darkness by I. io suggests a multimodal defence; in addition to the large eyespots, which intimidate birds, we suggest that the hissing and/or click sounds produced during wing flicking may have evolved as defence against rodent attacks. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Most recent tests of the theory of disruptive coloration have focussed on the disguise of the body's outline (e.g. Merilaita 1998; Cuthill et al. 2005; Schaefer & Stobbe 2006; Stevens et al. 2006b; Fraser et al. 2007). When placed at the body's edge, the high-contrast colour boundaries that are characteristic of disruptive patterning create false contours of higher stimulus intensity than those of the real outline (Stevens & Cuthill 2006; Stevens et al. 2006a). In this way, the probability of object recognition through boundary shape is diminished. However, the pioneers of the theory of disruptive coloration, Abbott Thayer (1909) and Hugh Cott (1940), also emphasised the importance of concealing other characteristic, and thus potentially revealing, body parts, such as eyes and limbs. Cott (1940) devoted a whole chapter of his influential textbook to this topic, arguing that the successful disguise of such features could be achieved through what he termed ‘coincident disruptive coloration’ (Figure 3.1). © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - Patches of black-and-white fur or skin are the subject of this chapter but they seem an unlikely form of camouflage. Conspicuous pelage conjures up aposematism or intraspecific communication (Wallace 1889) but we cannot take this for granted because three forms of camouflage may involve conspicuous coloration. These are disruptive coloration that relies on contrasting colours (Cott 1940; Cuthill & Szekely 2009; Stevens & Merilaita 2009), high-contrast markings that may draw the attention of the viewer, impeding detection or recognition of prey (Dimitrova et al. 2009), and background matching in environments that have dark shadows, or white snow and ice (Thayer 1909). Furthermore, aposematic colour patterns can be conspicuous nearby but cryptic at a distance (Marshall 2000; Tullberg et al. 2005; Gomez & Thery 2007). Unfortunately, there have been very few attempts to document or test theories about black-and-white coloration in mammals. Here I categorise all terrestrial mammals into ten different groupings, and marine mammals into three, based principally on the placement and pattern of black-and-white patches of fur or skin. Then I use natural history and principles of animal coloration to suggest why certain species have evolved conspicuous coloration. Many of the great Victorian and twentieth-century naturalists debated issues of animal coloration in just such a way (Caro et al. 2008a, b). The novelty of my review is that it is comprehensive (although not completely exhaustive) but it faces some problems. First, I may have misclassified species because conspicuous coloration apparent in photographs or descriptions may not be conspicuous under natural conditions (see Wallace 1889; Poulton 1890; Thayer 1909; Hingston 1933). © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - The African butterfly Bicyclus anynana is an emerging model in evo-devo and eco-evo-devo. Much has been learned about the development, genetics, and evolution of wing eyespot patterns and about how seasonal polyphenism in this species provides an adaptive response to the wet-dry environments it inhabits. Recent work is also examining the role of male secondary sexual traits, the wing scent brushes, and associated sex pheromones in mate choice and sexual selection. However, B. anynana is but one member of a spectacular radiation amounting to some 250 extant species in the subtribe Mycalesina in the Old World tropics. Therefore, it is appropriate timing to consider whether the experimental work on a single species can help in analyzing pattern and process in the spectacular expansion of this whole clade of mycalesine butterflies. The most recent molecular phylogenetics (Kodandaramaiah et al. 2010) underpins the occurrence of several parallel geographical radiations on the African mainland, on Madagascar, and in Asia. Expansions of the mycalesine butterflies into more seasonal environments may have occurred in tandem with those of their larval host plants, the grasses, around 25 million years ago. This article examines how the findings from multidisciplinary work on B. anynana could be the basis for a comparative approach to unravel the processes of adaptation and speciation that have yielded patterns of occupancy of trait space in the mycalesines. The parallel nature of radiations in at leastthree geographical regions provides exceptional power for such an analysis. I argue that research on B. anynana has provided an invaluable backbone for such an endeavor by revealing candidate suites of traits involved in adaptation to new ecological opportunities and in the evolution of reproductive isolation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Humans' proneness to see faces even in inanimate structures such as cars has long been noticed, yet empirical evidence is scarce. To examine this tendency of anthropomorphism, participants were asked to compare specific features (such as the eyes) of a face and a car front presented next to each other. Eye movement patterns indicated on which visual information participants relied to solve the task and clearly revealed the perception offacial features in cars, such as headlights as eyes or grille as nose. Most importantly, a predominance of headlights was found in attracting and guiding people's gaze irrespective of the feature they were asked to compare - equivalent to the role of the eyes during face perception. This response to abstract configurations is interpreted as an adaptive bias of the respective inherent mechanism for face perception and is evolutionarily reasonable with regard to a »better safe than sorry« strategy.

AB  - Background: Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions-in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities. © 2010 Olofsson et al.

AB  - Face perception serves as the basis for much of human social exchange. Diverse information can be extracted about an individual from a single glance at their face, including their identity, emotional state, and direction of attention. Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments reveal a complex network of specialized areas in the human brain supporting these face-reading skills. Here we consider the evolutionary roots of human face perception by exploring the manner in which different animal species view and respond to faces. We focus on behavioral experiments collected from both primates and nonprimates, assessing the types of information that animals are able to extract from the faces of their conspecifics, human experimenters, and natural predators. These experiments reveal that faces are an important category of visual stimuli for animals in all major vertebrate taxa, possibly reflecting the early emergence of neural specialization for faces in vertebrate evolution. At the same time, some aspects of facial perception are only evident in primates and a few other social mammals, and may therefore have evolved to suit the needs of complex social communication. Because the human brain likely utilizes both primitive and recently evolved neural specializations for the processing of faces, comparative studies may hold the key to understanding how these parallel circuits emerged during human evolution. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The striking diversity in insect colouration, colour pattern and visual appearance (shape, size, texture or movement) has evolved in response to the needs of communication, both with conspecifics and visually guided predators. The question ‘how are insects viewed by their predators?’ hides a complex set of evolutionary processes, which we review here. In addition to a high taxonomic diversity, insectivorous species substantially differ in their visual performance, the mechanisms and flexibility of their predation behaviour, and how they use visual cues for prey detection, recognition, attack and capture. The large variety of predators' visual systems necessitates a thorough measurement of insect colouration (namely spectrometry and photography) ideally coupled to vision modelling to reconstruct colours as likely perceived by predators. In response to visual selection by predators, insects have evolved different strategies to decrease predation risk, such as camouflage—through disruptive colouration, background matching, countershading, masquerade or motion camouflage—or warning colouration in relation to toxicity. The interplay between insects and predators influences the dynamics of insect populations, an aspect of particular interest in the case of populations showing a colour polymorphism. In a critical review of all these aspects, we identify the visual cues most important for predation, the perceptual processes probably operating in predators, the methodological aspects to improve and the future directions for research. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Animal life, now and over the past half billion years, is incredibly diverse. Describing and understanding the evolution of this diversity of body plans - from vertebrates such as humans and fish to the numerous invertebrate groups including sponges, insects, molluscs, and the many groups of worms - is a major goal of evolutionary biology. This book adopts a modern, integrated approach to describe how current molecular genetic techniques and disciplines as diverse as palaeontology, embryology, and genomics have been combined, resulting in a dramatic renaissance in the study of animal evolution. The last decade has seen growing interest in evolutionary biology fuelled by a wealth of data from molecular biology. Modern phylogenies integrating evidence from molecules, embryological data, and morphology of living and fossil taxa provide a wide consensus of the major branching patterns of the tree of life; moreover, the links between phenotype and genotype are increasingly well understood. This has resulted in a reliable tree of relationships that has been widely accepted and has spawned numerous new and exciting questions that require a reassessment of the origins and radiation of animal life. The focus of this volume is at the level of major animal groups, the morphological innovations that define them, and the mechanisms of change to their embryology that have resulted in their evolution. Current research themes and future prospects are highlighted including phylogeny reconstruction, comparative developmental biology, the value of different sources of data and the importance of fossils, homology assessment, character evolution, phylogeny of major groups of animals, and genome evolution. These topics are integrated in the light of a 'new animal phylogeny', to provide fresh insights into the patterns and processes of animal evolution. © The Royal Society 2008: Chapters 12, 13, 14. © Oxford University Press 2009: All other chapters.

AB  - Butterfly eyespots have been the focus of a number of developmental and evolutionary studies. However, a phylogenetic component has rarely been explicitly incorporated in these studies. In this study, I utilize a phylogeny to trace the evolution of eyespot number and position on the wing in a group of nymphalid butterflies, the subtribe Junoniini. These butterflies have two kinds of eyespot arrangements which I refer to as Serial and Individual. In the Serial arrangement, eyespots are placed in a series on compartments 1-6 (counting from the anterior wing margin). In the Individual arrangement, eyespots are isolated on specific compartments, ranging from 1 to 4 in number. This can be divided into four subtypes based on the number and positions of eyespots. I map the evolution of these five arrangements over a phylogeny of Junoniini reconstructed with ca. 3000 base pairs of sequence data from three genes. The results show that almost all arrangements have evolved at least twice, with multiple shifts between them by addition and deletion of eyespots. I propose a model involving genetic or developmental coupling between eyespots in specific compartments to explain these shifts. I discuss their evolution in light of existing knowledge about their development. I also discuss potential explanations for functional significance of the eyespot patterns found in the group. Differential selection for and against eyespots, both at different times over the phylogeny and in different regions, have driven the evolution of eyespot arrangements. The study throws open many questions about the adaptive significance of eyespots and the developmental underpinnings of the various arrangements. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) colorations have garnered extensive theoretical and empirical treatment in recent years, although the majority of studies have concerned themselves with avian taxa. However, many lizards have acute visual systems with retinal photoreceptors that are sensitive to UV wavelengths, and also display UV-reflecting colour patches. In the present study, we used UV photography and full-spectrum reflectance spectrophotometry to describe intra- and intersexual colour variation in adult ocellated lizards Lacerta (Timon) lepida and to obtain evidence of UV-based ornamentation. We also investigated whether any colour traits correlate with morphological traits potentially related to individual quality. The results obtained show that the prominent eyespots and blue outer ventral scales (OVS) that ocellated lizards have on their flanks reflect strongly in the UV range and are best described as UV/blue in coloration. The eyespots of males are larger and cover a larger surface area than those of females. However, these differences can be entirely accounted for by sex differences in body size, with males being generally larger than females. We also found differences in the shape of reflectance curves from males and females, with the eyespots and blue OVS of males being more UV-shifted than those of females. Other body regions have extremely low UV reflectance and are not sexually dichromatic. Eyespot size and the total surface area covered by eyespots increases with body size in males but not in females, suggesting that they may be signalling an intrinsic individual characteristic such as body size or male fighting ability. We also discuss the alternative and non-exclusive hypothesis that eyespots may function in lizards of both sexes as protective markings against predators. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Experiments in humans have shown that changes in emotional (affective) state cause adaptive changes in the processing of incoming information, termed "cognitive bias". For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with "pessimistic" judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling "threat call" (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds' behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We characterized sperm precedence in monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), using a series of experiments in which we manipulated male mating histories to vary spermatophore size and the number of sperm transferred. Several factors affected the outcome of sperm competition. There was a pattern of second-male sperm precedence, but second-male precedence was rarely complete, and several other factors had significant effects on paternity patterns. Larger males outcompeted smaller males when they were not matched for size. Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) genotype affected the outcome of sperm competition under very hot conditions. When sperm from the same pair of males competed in different females, males fared better when they transferred more sperm. These results demonstrate that sperm precedence within a species can be affected by many factors, including the circumstances under which it is measured.

AB  - It has long been recognized that many hoverfly species (Diptera: Syrphidae) mimic the morphological appearance of defended Hymenoptera, such as wasps and bees. However, it has also been repeatedly suggested that some mimetic hoverflies respond with sounds on attack that resemble the warning or startle sounds of their hymenopteran models. In this study, we set out to quantitatively compare the spectral characteristics of the sounds produced by a range of nonmimetic flies, wasps, bumblebees, honeybees, and their hoverfly mimics when they were artificially attacked. The sounds made by wasps and honeybees after simulated attacks were statistically distinguishable from their hoverfly mimics. Bumblebee models of their hoverfly mimics share some similarities in the sound they produce on attack, but they were no closer acoustically to their model than a range of other hoverfly species that morphologically resemble other models. All the mimetic hoverflies tested in this study tended to sound similar to one another, regardless of the model they resemble morphologically. Overall, we found little evidence that mimetic hoverflies sound like their hymenopteran models on attack, and we question whether acoustic mimicry has evolved in this complex.

AB  - Prey animals can survive a predatory encounter if they communicate unprofitability to an approaching predator. Otherwise undefended prey often use conspicuous deimatic (frightening) displays to intimidate closely approaching predators into delaying or aborting an attack. The 'startle' displays of several insect groups are the best-known example: comprising a sudden size increase coupled with a conspicuous 'eyespot' pattern, these displays can effectively deter highly dangerous avian predators, although they are often unsuccessful. Cephalopods perform remarkably similar visual displays that are presumed to function in the same way, although evidence for this is lacking. Unlike large insects, cephalopods possess rapid escape responses, and seem unlikely to benefit from predator hesitation. Moreover, field and laboratory-based observations with cuttlefish suggest that what has previously been labelled the Deimatic Display may be directed towards small teleosts that pose little or no direct predation risk. In staged encounters between cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, and large predatory fish (sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax and smooth hound Mustelus mustelus), naïve cuttlefish did not perform their Deimatic Display towards large predators, even when spatially constrained and unable to flee. Cuttlefish also discriminated between large predators, selectively using a different visual signal (previously termed the Flamboyant Display) towards the more dangerous teleost fish. These results strongly suggest that, although superficially similar, cephalopod deimatic displays are functionally different to insect displays: large brains and keen senses allow cuttlefish to discriminate between species, and selectively signal to small and only indirectly threatening teleost intruders, rather than highly dangerous predators. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Ricklefs and O'Rourke compared the diversity of appearance (aspect diversity) in samples of moths attracted to ultraviolet lights in Colorado, Arizona, and Panama. The more speciesrich Panamanian assemblage of moths exhibited proportionately greater diversity of color and form, which supported stronger frequency-dependent selection by predators to diversify the strategies that moths adopt to achieve crypsis in an ecological space composed of resting backgrounds. Comparable analyses of 15 additional samples obtained from Ecuador to Canada fail to support Ricklefs and O'Rourke's original result. In the present analysis, two measures of the volume of aspect space were unrelated to the number of species per sample and did not differ between temperate and tropical localities. Either frequency-dependent (apostatic) selection is not a powerful force in diversifying moth appearance, or it does not vary with latitude, or potential resting backgrounds and cryptic strategies are similarly constrained in temperate and tropical regions. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Even if an animal matches its surroundings perfectly in colour and texture, any mismatch between the spatial phase of its pattern and that of the background, or shadow created by its three-dimensional relief, is potentially revealing. Nevertheless, for camouflage to be fully broken, the shape must be recognizable. Disruptive coloration acts against object recognition by the use of high-contrast internal colour boundaries to break up shape and form. As well as the general outline, characteristic features such as eyes and limbs must also be concealed; this can be achieved by having the colour patterns on different, but adjacent, body parts aligned to match each other (i.e. in phase). Such 'coincident disruptive coloration' ensures that there is no phase disjunction where body parts meet, and causes different sections of the body to blend perceptually. We tested this theory using field experiments with predation by wild birds on artificial moth-like targets, whose wings and (edible pastry) bodies had colour patterns that were variously coincident or not. We also carried out an experiment with humans searching for analogous targets on a computer screen. Both experiments show that coincident disruptive coloration is an effective mechanism for concealing an otherwise revealing body form. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - Here I survey, collate and synthesize contrasting coloration in 5000 species of terrestrial mammals focusing on black and white pelage. After briefly reviewing alternative functional hypotheses for coloration in mammals, I examine nine colour patterns and combinations on different areas of the body and for each mammalian taxon to try to identify the most likely evolutionary drivers of contrasting coloration. Aposematism and perhaps conspecific signalling are the most consistent explanations for black and white pelage in mammals; background matching may explain white pelage. Evidence for contrasting coloration is being involved in crypsis through pattern blending, disruptive coloration or serving other functions, such as signalling dominance, lures, reducing eye glare or in temperature regulation has barely moved beyond anecdotal stages of investigation. Sexual dichromatism is limited in this taxon and its basis is unclear. Astonishingly, the functional significance of pelage coloration in most large charismatic black and white mammals that were new to science 150 years ago still remains a mystery. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - While the most obvious use of coloration as an antipredatory defense is in camouflage, here we focus on other uses. Many chemically defended prey advertise these defenses with bright color signals (such as the yellow-and-black striped pattern of many wasps). Such aposematic signals aid predators in learning to avoid attacking such defended species. Mimicry occurs when two species share the same aposematic signal, and the signal similarity may benefit one or both species. Coloration may also influence the predator's point of attack on a prey's body, or 'startle' a predator into aborting an attack. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the challenges for a modern integrative biology is to more fully understand why assemblages of related species occupy morphospace in the way they do. An integration of analyses of both form and function is required to achieve this goal. The burgeoning understanding of development in emerging model species is providing evolutionary biologists with the potential to explore contributions to the evolution of patterns in morphospace by the processes involved in making variation in forms as well as those resulting from their performance in natural environments. Such an approach is illustrated here by drawing on work on butterfly eyespot patterns and scaling relationships. Relevant studies are being performed in some other groups of animals (see Brakefield 2006), and progress is also being made in plants (see Langlade et al. 2005; Niklas, ch. 3 in this volume). Patterns in morphospace have always fascinated biologists, especially when they are known to reflect adaptive radiation among new ecological niches. In such examples, while there can be no doubt that natural selection plays a major role in shaping the evolution of morphological diversity and disparity, it is by no means clear how much the processes involved in generating variation in the phenotype to be screened by the natural selection also contribute. Thus, the extent to which evolution by natural selection of adaptations to local environments is compromised or biased by the genetical and developmental origins of phenotypic variation remains an open issue. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

AB  - Many animals are marked with conspicuous circular features often called 'eyespots', which intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. It has long been assumed that eyespots work by mimicking the eyes of larger animals, but recent experiments have indicated that conspicuousness and contrast is important in eyespot function, and not eye mimicry. We undertake two further experiments to distinguish between the conspicuousness and mimicry hypotheses, by using artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field. In experiment 1, we test if eyespot effectiveness depends on the marking shape (bar or circle) and arrangement (eye-like and non- eye-like positions). We find no difference between shapes or arrangement; all spots were equally effective in scaring birds. In experiment 2, we test if the often yellow and black colors of eyespots mimic the eyes of birds of prey. We find no effect of shape, and no advantage to yellow and black spots over non-eye-like but equally conspicuous colors. The consistent finding is that eyespot function lies in being a conspicuous signal to predators, and not necessarily due to eye mimicry. © 2009 Current Zoology.

AB  - Historically, morphological variation has been used to classify many species (and subspecies) of Lepidoptera. However, some of this variation may be unsuitable for inferring the recent evolutionary history of populations. Genetic data provide an alternative. We examine the morphological and genetic variation within and between British subspecies of Coenonympha tullia (Müller 1764) to test the hypothesis that neutral genetic variation corresponds to morphological variation. We find that most morphological and genetic variation occurs within populations and that those populations designated as subspecies based on morphological characters are not necessarily most closely related for mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA (amplified fragment length polymorphisms and allozymes). Thus, the notion that wing spot variation reflects population isolation and therefore genetic differentiation does not hold. The present study highlights the need for genetic data where taxonomy may be based on environmentally plastic or locally adapted characters because such characters will not reflect the true population genetic history. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 97, 314-327. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Adult life spans of insects are part of supposedly adaptive life-history syndromes, which involve a variety of reproductive strategies with regard to mating, egg maturation and egg laying. Contingencies of life span with many other morphological, behavioural, and ecological traits are to be expected. We used a data-mining approach, incorporating controls for phylogeny, to uncover broad patterns of trait contingencies in a literature-derived data set of adult life spans for 350 butterfly species. We found that adult feeding habit has strong links with life spans, with pollen-feeders living longer than fruit feeders, which in turn live longer than nectar feeders. Furthermore, traits reducing susceptibility to predators (i.e. aposematism, eye-spots) are associated with longer life. Mud-puddling behaviour as a means of gaining access to minerals, and possibly nitrogen, was generally associated with a short life. We also found strong impacts of the region of occurrence of species (i.e. whether they were tropical or temperate taxa), but received conflicting results depending on whether we analysed field data (longer life in the tropics) or data from caged individuals (shorter life in the tropics). Adult longevity was associated with the growth form of larval host plants (higher on lianas as opposed to herbs, shrubs, or trees), whereas other larval host plant traits did not have strong links with species' life spans. We discuss the hypothetical evolutionary mechanisms explaining those patterns and suggest predictions that could be tested in further research. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Color patterns in fish are often multicomponent signals, composed of pigment-based and structural color patches that can be used to communicate within species, in both inter- and intrasexual interactions, and between species. In this review, we discuss some of the roles played by pigment-based elements of color pattern. We begin by discussing general forms of coloration, classifying them by appearance (e.g., cryptic vs. conspicuous) and apparent function (e.g., conspicuous coloration and mating displays, stripes and cooperation, and bars and aggression). We then briefly discuss the roles pigments play in the perception of these color patterns via their presence in the eye. In the last section, we look at the relative importance of carotenoid versus melanic coloration in situations where honest signals to potential rivals and potential mates might be required. In this survey, we have highlighted some recent research, especially studies that consider both the physiological and behavioral processes underlying the evolution and expression of pigment-based color patterns in fish. The nature of pigmented color patterns depends not just on the dynamics of pattern development and physiological regulation, but also on the behavioral roles played by these patterns, both now and in the past. As such, advances in particular fields of study on pigment patterns (physiology, developmental biology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, etc.) will increasingly depend on insights from other fields. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Animals utilise various strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including camouflage, warning colours and mimicry, and many of these protective signals promote avoidance behaviour in predators. For example, various species possess paired circular 'eyespots', which startle or intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. However, little is known of how the efficacy of such signals relates to the context in which they are found, and no studies have tested the relative effectiveness of anti-predator signals when on otherwise camouflaged and conspicuous prey. We find that the protective value of conspicuous wing spots, placed on artificial moth-like targets presented to wild birds in the field, is strongly affected by the attributes of the prey 'animal' on which they are found. Wing spots reduced predation when on conspicuous prey but were rendered ineffective when on otherwise camouflaged targets, indeed they increased the risk of predation compared to non-marked camouflaged controls. These results demonstrate how different anti-predator strategies may interact, and that protective signals can switch from being beneficial to costly under different contexts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The color patterns on the wings of butterflies have been an important model system in evolutionary developmental biology. A recent computational model tested genetic regulatory hierarchies hypothesized to underlie the formation of butterfly eyespot foci [Evans, T.M., Marcus, J.M., 2006. A simulation study of the genetic regulatory hierarchy for butterfly eyespot focus determination. Evol. Dev. 8, 273-283]. The computational model demonstrated that one proposed hierarchy was incapable of reproducing the known patterns of gene expression associated with eyespot focus determination in wild-type butterflies, but that two slightly modified alternative hierarchies were capable of reproducing all of the known gene expressions patterns. Here we extend the computational models previously implemented in Delphi 2.0 to two mutants derived from the squinting bush brown butterfly (Bicyclus anynana). These two mutants, comet and Cyclops, have aberrantly shaped eyespot foci that are produced by different mechanisms. The comet mutation appears to produce a modified interaction between the wing margin and the eyespot focus that results in a series of comet-shaped eyespot foci. The Cyclops mutation causes the failure of wing vein formation between two adjacent wing-cells and the fusion of two adjacent eyespot foci to form a single large elongated focus in their place. The computational approach to modeling pattern formation in these mutants allows us to make predictions about patterns of gene expression, which are largely unstudied in butterfly mutants. It also suggests a critical experiment that will allow us to distinguish between two hypothesized genetic regulatory hierarchies that may underlie all butterfly eyespot foci. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Eyespots have long been thought to confer protection against predators, but empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these markings and their survival value in the wild is limited. Using a mark-recapture experiment, I examined the functional significance of the eyespot on the dorsal fin of a juvenile tropical fish to its survival on coral reefs. None of the juveniles recaptured 1 month after settlement showed evidence of bite marks on the posterior region of the bodies to suggest a deflective function of their eyespot. When I compared the survivors with recruits from the same settlement cohort, I detected no change in the frequency distribution of eyespot size, suggesting no selective pressure operating on this trait. I compared these survivors with conspecifics from the same cohort collected at settlement and then outgrown in the absence of predators under 3 food regimes and 2 levels of intraspecific competition. I found that the eyespots of wild juveniles were larger overall than those of conspecifics maintained in a predator-free environment. The results of this study indicate that larger eyespots per se do not confer a survival advantage in the wild, suggesting that eyespots of this species may not have the long-assumed antipredatory function but play a role in interactions with adult conspecifics. I suggest that juveniles maintain eyespots even when predators or adult conspecifics are absent because they can be afforded at very low costs and may still be beneficial to their bearer under specific ecological conditions. © The Author 2008.

AB  - Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals. © The Author 2008.

AB  - Serial homology is widespread in organismal design, but the origin and individuation of these repeated structures appears to differ with the different types of serial homologues, and remains an intriguing and exciting topic of research. Here I focus on the evolution of the serially repeated eyespots that decorate the margin of the wings of nymphalid butterflies. In this system, unresolved questions relate to the evolutionary steps that lead to the appearance of these serial homologues and how their separate identities evolved. I present and discuss two alternative hypotheses. The first proposes that eyespots first appeared as a row of undifferentiated repeated modules, one per wing compartment, that later become individuated. This individuation allowed eyespots to appear and disappear from specific wing compartments and also allowed eyespots to acquire different morphologies. The second hypothesis proposes that eyespots first appeared as individuated single units, or groups of units, that over evolutionary time were co-opted into new compartments on the wing. I discuss the merits of each of these alternate hypotheses by finding analogies to other systems and propose research avenues for addressing these issues in the future. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Organisms are inherently modular, yet modules also evolve in response to selection for functional integration or functional specialization of traits. For serially repeated homologous traits, there is a clear expectation that selection on the function of individual traits will reduce the integration between traits and subdivide a single ancestral module. The eyespots on butterfly wings are one example of serially repeated morphological traits that share a common developmental mechanism but are subject to natural and sexual selection for divergent functions. Here, I test two hypotheses about the organization of the eyespot pattern into independent dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior modules, using a graphical modeling technique to examine patterns of eyespot covariation among and within wing surfaces in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Although there is a hierarchical and complex pattern of integration among eyespots, the results show a surprising mismatch between patterns of eyespot integration and the developmental and evolutionary eyespot units identified in previous empirical studies. These results are discussed in light of the relationships between developmental, functional, and evolutionary modules, and they suggest that developmental sources of independent trait variation are often masked by developmental sources of trait integration. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo will make crucial contributions over the coming years to exploring the occupancy of morphospace. Why do species show the patterns of diversity and disparity they do, and to what extent do such patterns reflect the ways in which phenotypic variation is generated as well as the processes of natural selection? Evo-devo in appropriate study systems is providing the means to explore fully how phenotypic variation is generated by the processes intrinsic to individuals, especially those of development. Substantial progress will be made in understanding the occupancy of morphospace if the results of this type of evo-devo can then be combined with analyses of how this same variation is influenced by natural selection and other extrinsic processes to result in the patterns of evolution. Use can also be made here of recent advances in developing appropriate null models for testing adaptive versus neutral or random-walk explanations of evolution (Pie and Weitz 2005). In combination, this type of broad evo-devo and evolutionary biology can begin to unravel how evolvability, the capacity to evolve at the genetical and developmental levels, contributes to shaping the evolution of patterns of diversity and disparity in phenotypic space (Brakefield 2006). We will then be able to examine the extent to which such phenomena as genetic channelling, developmental bias and developmental drive are reflected in patterns of evolution, whether involving change or stasis (e.g. Maynard Smith et al. 1985, Schluter 1996, Wagner and Altenberg 1996, Arthur 2001, Blows and Hoffman 2005). © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

AB  - As research neurobiologists, we pursue specific questions, and the answers rendered are also correspondingly specific. Our goal, however, is to understand an entire system or the whole organism. To that end, it is not only useful, but sometimes also necessary, that we periodically reappraise a body of specific data in light of current knowledge of the field at large. In this spirit, the present paper reviews my work on the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying the reproductive system of ring doves and others' studies of songbirds. By integrating these fields I then advance the concept that inherent in the avian breeding system is the mechanism of "state-reading" (a term fashioned after "mindreading", which was coined by cognitive neuroscientists). State-reading helps to coordinate a sequence of endocrine and behavioral events to realize a desired objective, in this case, successful reproduction. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents different semiotic perspectives on biological mimicry, which is considered to be a communicative system consisting of a mimic, a model, and a signal-receiver. Proceeding from the writings of Thomas A. Sebeok, the activity of the mimic and the relationship between mimicry and iconicity are analyzed. From the signal-receiver's perspective, mimicry is described as a probable mistake in recognition and it is characterized by the notion of ambivalent sign. Ambivalent sign is a stable sign structure fiuctuating between one and two signs. On the basis of Jakob von Uexküll's works, mimicry resemblance is described as taking place in animal Umwelten. From this semiotic viewpoint, various examples of abstract resemblance in nature are regarded as 'resemblance with meaning' and an alternative explanation to the concept of abstract mimicry is presented. © Walter de Gruyter 2007.

AB  - Much of the information in visual signals is encoded in motion, form, and texture. Current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying visual communication is spread across diverse disciplines. Contemporary perspectives on the physics, psychology, and genetics of visual signal generation and perception can be synthesized into a conceptually integrative approach. Developmental mechanisms of pattern formation suggest that small changes in gene regulation or structure can result in major shifts in signal architecture. Animals in many species have been shown to attend to variation in higher-order stimulus properties. Preferences for these properties can be innately specified or learned, and may also show large shifts or reversals. Perceptual mechanisms, particularly visual attention, associated with spatiotemporal features are likely to be a major force in shaping the design of visual signals.

AB  - Feeding experiments with lizards are used to examine the function of small eyespot markings found along the wing margins of many butterfly species. Such eyespots are frequently suggested to function by deflecting the attacks of vertebrate predators away from the vulnerable body towards the wing margins, which can tear easily; the eyespots are considered to mislead predators and to act as targets for their attacks. Such misdirected attacks give the butterflies a chance to evade capture, albeit sometimes losing pieces of wing tissue. As a model prey species, we used fruit-feeding individuals of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana that were attacked in a standard way in laboratory cages by the anolis lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We also manipulated the butterflies' wing patterns by pasting eyespots on different parts of the wings to examine the deflection hypothesis in more detail. Our results indicate no influence on the lizard attacks either of the presence of eyespots, or of their position on the wings. The lizards attacked butterflies in a highly stereotyped manner both when the prey were presented on matching or on contrasting backgrounds. We thus found no support for the deflection hypothesis for attacks by insectivorous lizards. Indeed, our only support to date has been obtained for naïve flycatcher birds, but even this requires further corroboration. Although effective deflection may occur rather infrequently, except perhaps under certain ecological conditions such as high-density feeding of butterflies on fallen fruit, it may still be sufficiently consistent over time to have contributed to shaping the evolution of marginal eyespot patterns. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Eyespots are repeated elements in the wing pattern of butterflies. In the species-rich genus of Bicyclus, all eyespots are formed by the same developmental process. Artificial selection in B. anynana has explored how readily two of the eyespots can become different to each other. There is sufficient standing genetic and developmental variation in a single stock of this species for high flexibility in the responses for eyespot size; indeed selection over 25 generations in several directions of morphospace yielded phenotypes far beyond the variability found in the whole genus. In contrast, experiments on another eyespot trait, their colour composition, indicate that comparable flexibility occurs only along the axis of least resistance in which both eyespots change in the same direction. This result is reflected in both a clear difference in the developmental regulation of eyespot size and colour composition, and in the patterns of variability among species. Such research that integrates evolutionary genetics and Evo-Devo will eventually reveal how evolutionary tinkering occurs in both genetical and developmental terms, and will also explore the consequences of differences in evolvability for patterns of diversity.

AB  - Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The evolution of wings and the adaptive advantage they provide have allowed insects to become one of the most evolutionarily successful groups on earth. The incredible diversity of their shape, size, and color patterns is a direct reflection of the important role wings have played in the radiation of insects. In this review, we highlight recent studies on both butterflies and Drosophila that have begun to uncover the types of genetic variations and developmental mechanisms that control diversity in wing color patterns. In butterflies, these analyses are now possible because of the recent development of a suite of genomic and functional tools, such as detailed linkage maps and transgenesis. In one such study, extensive linkage mapping in Heliconius butterflies has shown that surprisingly few, and potentially homologous, loci are responsible for several major pattern variations on the wings of these butterflies. Parallel work on a clade of Drosophila has uncovered how cis-regulatory changes of the same gene correlate with the repeated gain and loss of pigmented wing spots. Collectively, our understanding of formation and evolution of color pattern in insect wings is rapidly advancing because of these recent breakthroughs in several different fields. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigated both the phenotypic and developmental integration of eyespots on the fore- and hindwings of speckled wood butterflies Pararge aegeria. Eyespots develop within a framework of wing veins, which may not only separate eyespots developmentally, but may at the same time also integrate them by virtue of being both signalling sources and barriers during eyespot development. We therefore specifically investigated the interaction between wing venation patterns and eyespot integration. Phenotypic covariation among eyespots was very high, but only eyespots in neighbouring wing cells and in homologous wing cells on different wing surfaces were developmentally integrated. This can be explained by the fact that the wing cells of these eyespots share one or more wing veins. The wing venation patterns of fore- and hindwings were highly integrated, both phenotypically and developmentally. This did not affect overall developmental integration of the eyespots. The adaptive significance of integration patterns is discussed and more specifically we stress the need to conduct studies on phenotypic plasticity of integration. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Large eyespots on the wings of butterflies and moths have been ascribed generally intimidating qualities by creating a frightening image of a bird or mammal much larger than the insect bearing the eyespots. However, evidence for this anti-predator adaptation has been largely anecdotal and only recently were peacock butterflies, Inachis io, shown to effectively thwart attacks from blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Here, we test whether large eyespots on lepidopterans are generally effective in preventing attacks from small passerines and whether the size of insect or bird can influence the outcome of interactions. We staged experiments between the larger eyed hawkmoths, Smerinthus ocellatus, and the smaller peacock butterflies, I. io, and the larger great tits, Parus major, and the smaller blue tits, P. caeruleus. Survival differed substantially between the insect species with 21 of 24 peacock butterflies, but only 6 of 27 eyed hawkmoths, surviving attacks from the birds. Thus, surprisingly, the smaller prey survived to a higher extent, suggesting that factors other than insect size may be important. However, great tits were less easily intimidated by the insects' eyespots and deimatic behaviour and consumed 16 of 26, but the blue tits only 8 of 25, of the butterflies and hawkmoths. Our results demonstrate that eyespots per se do not guarantee survival and that these two insects bearing equally large eyespots are not equally well protected against predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Animals possess a range of defensive markings to reduce the risk of predation, including warning colours, camouflage, eyespots and mimicry. These different strategies are frequently considered independently, and with little regard towards predator vision, even though they may be linked in various ways and can be fully understood only in terms of predator perception. For example, camouflage and warning coloration need not be mutually exclusive, and may frequently exploit similar features of visual perception. This paper outlines how different forms of protective markings can be understood from predator perception and illustrates how this is fundamental in determining the mechanisms underlying, and the interrelation between, different strategies. Suggestions are made for future work, and potential mechanisms discussed in relation to various forms of defensive coloration, including disruptive coloration, eyespots, dazzle markings, motion camouflage, aposematism and mimicry. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - Plasticity is a crucial component of the life cycle of invertebrates that live as active adults throughout wet and dry seasons in the tropics. Such plasticity is seen in the numerous species of Bicyclus butterflies in Africa which exhibit seasonal polyphenism with sequential generations of adults with one or other of two alternative phenotypes. These differ not only in wing pattern but in many other traits. This divergence across a broad complex of traits is associated with survival and reproduction either in a wet season that is favourable in terms of resources, or mainly in a dry season that is more stressful. This phenomenon has led us to examine the bases of the developmental plasticity in a model species, B. anynana, and also the evolution of key adult life history traits, including starvation resistance and longevity. We now understand something about the processes that generate variation in the phenotype, and also about the ecological context of responses to environmental stress. The responses clearly involve a mix of developmental plasticity as cued by different environments in pre-adult development, and the acclimation of life history traits in adults to their prevailing environment. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Cases of mimicry provide many of the nature's most convincing examples of natural selection. Here we report evidence for a case of predator mimicry in which metalmark moths in the genus Brenthia mimic jumping spiders, one of their predators. In controlled trials, Brenthia had higher survival rates than other similarly sized moths in the presence of jumping spiders and jumping spiders responded to Brenthia with territorial displays, indicating that Brenthia were sometimes mistaken for jumping spiders, and not recognized as prey. Our experimental results and a review of wing patterns of other insects indicate that jumping spider mimicry is more widespread than heretofore appreciated, and that jumping spiders are probably an important selective pressure shaping the evolution of diurnal insects that perch on vegetation. © 2006 Rota, Wagner.
